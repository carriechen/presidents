This bombshell report reveals the colossal nature of Donald Trump's past business failures and just how long he may have avoided paying any federal income taxes whatsoever. In one year, Donald Trump lost nearly a billion dollars. A billion. He stiffed small businesses, laid off workers, and walked away from hardworking communities. And how did it work out for him? He apparently got to avoid paying taxes for nearly two decades – while tens of millions of working families paid theirs. He calls that 'smart.' Now that the gig is up, why doesn't he go ahead and release his returns to show us all how 'smart' he really is?\"", "timestamp": "2016-10-01", "title": "Hillary for America Statement on Report That Donald Trump Used Business Failures to Avoid Paying Taxes"}

One goes like this. Eight years after the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes, our economy has created jobs for 71 straight months. That's a new record. Unemployment has fallen below 5 percent. Last year, the typical household saw its income grow by about twenty-eight hundred dollars, the biggest 1-year increase ever. And the uninsured rate is at an alltime low.\nAll that is true. What's also true is that too much of our wealth is still taken by the top, and that leaves too many families still working paycheck to paycheck, without a lot of breathing room.\nThere are two things we can do about this. We can prey on people's worries for political gain, or we can actually do something to help working families feel more secure in today's economy.\nCount me in the latter camp. And here's one thing that will help right away: making sure more of our families have access to paid leave. Today, having both parents in the workforce is an economic necessity for many families. But right now millions of Americans don't have access to even a single day of paid sick leave. So if you get sick, that sticks you with a lousy choice. Do you go to work and get everyone else sick too, or do you take care of yourself at the risk of a paycheck? If your kid gets sick, do you send her to school anyway, or do you stay home to take care of her, lose a day's pay, and maybe even put your own job at risk?\nWe shouldn't have to make choices like that in America. That's why I've repeatedly called on the Republican Congress to pass a law guaranteeing most workers in America the chance to earn 7 days of paid sick leave each year. Of course, Congress hasn't acted. But we've also worked with States, cities, and businesses to try to get the job done, and many have, pointing to research showing that paid leave actually helps their bottom line. In fact, since I took office, another 10 million private sector workers have gained paid sick leave, making up a record share of our workforce.\nUnfortunately, there are still about 40 million private sector workers who don't get a single day. That's why I'm doing what I can on my own. Effective on January 1, Federal contractors will be required to give their employees working on new Federal contracts up to 7 paid sick days each year. That's happening. It will help about a million workers when they or a loved one gets sick. It will cover time you need for preventive care. It will cover absences resulting from domestic violence or sexual assault. And it means everyone else is less likely to catch what someone else has got, whether it's a coworker or the person preparing or serving your food.\nPaid sick leave isn't a side issue or a women's issue or something that's just nice to have. It's a must-have. By the way, so are economic priorities like childcare, paid family leave, equal pay, and a higher minimum wage. We need a Congress that will act on all these issues too, because they'd make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of Americans who are working hard every day. It's more than talk, it's action. And that's what you should demand of every politician who wants the privilege to serve you.\nThanks, everybody, and have a great weekend.", "timestamp": "2016-10-01", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}
{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "note": "Speech as delivered.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119152", "text": "\"This is the day the Lord has made. Let us rejoice and be glad in it!\nI am so [...] and so honored to be here. Thank you so much Reverend Dr. Walker. Thanks to the members of the Little Rock A.M.E. Zion. I have to confess – we were putting together the [...] Rev. Walker was [...]\nBut he told me his church [...] 134 years ago was founded in a house on a rock and that rock has been sturdy and steady [...]\nI am so delighted to be here with your Congresswoman, Congresswoman Adams, who has a [...] path in the Congress, such a [...] of conviction. And my thanks also to Donna [...] for her leadership for that stirring description [...] Thank you so much.\nThis church for all those years has been a source of strength and solace, for generations of congregants and [...] It has helped people get [...]. It has helped people deal with the sorrows that come [...] and it has [...] the world outside challenged the faith that comes from belief. In here, in this magnificent house of worship, we pray for peace when there is too much violence outside of these walls. In here, we are called to confront injustice, even when the world out there fails to see it. In here, we see the world as it is, but we pray for the strength and wisdom to build the world as it should be.\nIt has been 12 days since Mr. Scott was shot and killed. Twelve days since his wife Rakeiya Scott watched her husband die, and seven children lost their father. Now we don't yet know all the details about the shooting, but we do know this family and this community is in pain. And therefore we pray for them and we pray for all families who have suffered similar losses. But we do more than pray. As Ms. Bradford said, 'We do what each of us can do.' Not everyone can march, but everyone can talk, and everyone can reach out and everyone can vote.\nToo many African American families have been in the same tragic situation that the Scott family has found themselves. In fact, the day before Mr. Scott died, another father, Terence Crutcher, was killed in a police encounter in Tulsa, Oklahoma. And there have been many others. So many fathers and sons and even mothers and daughters who have died either after encounters with the police or at the hands of civilians with guns while they were doing things that were ordinary, everyday activities. Walking home from the store with iced tea and Skittles, listening to music in their car with friends.\nAnd we also know -- and we must not forget -- that violence has touched the families of police officers. Men and women who put on the uniform and put their lives on the line to protect others. From Dallas to Baton Rouge to Philadelphia, the families of fallen officers have also been dealt a great blow and they deserve our prayers as well.\nIt's been a hard year, hasn't it? Think about how many times President Obama has had to console our nation about another senseless tragedy, another shattered family, another distressed community. And our children are watching, and they feel it too. You've seen that right here in Charlotte. Last Monday at the city council meeting, 10-year-old Taje Gaddy said, 'I wake up every morning scared that I won't get to grow up because I am black.'\nA nine-year-old, Zianna Oliphant, who's here with us today, along with her brother Marquis and her family, also spoke at that city council meeting, with tears pouring down her face. And when I read what she had said, I had tears in my eyes too. She said, 'We are black people and we shouldn't have to feel like this. It's a shame that our fathers and mothers are killed, and we can't even see them anymore. It's a shame that we have to go to their graveyard and bury them. We need our fathers and mothers to be by our side.' What courage and clarity that young lady showed to the world.\nBut can you imagine, nine years old. She should be thinking about happy adventures, dreaming about all the wonderful things her future holds for her. Instead she's talking about graveyards. Our entire country should take a moment to really look at what's going on here, and across America, to imagine what we see on the news, and what we hear about, imagine through our children's eyes.\nI'm a grandmother, and like every grandmother I worry about the safety and security of my grandchildren, but my worries are not the same as black grandmothers. They have different, and deeper fears about the world that their grandchildren face. It makes my heart ache, when kids like Zianna, are going through this and trying to make sense of the absolutely senseless. I know how I would feel. I wouldn't be able to stand it if my grandchildren had to be scared and worried the way too many children across our country feel right now. But because my grandchildren are white, because they are the grandchildren of a former president and secretary of state, let's be honest here – they won't face the kind of fear that we heard from the young children testifying before the city council.\nYou know, every child deserves the same sense of security, every child deserves the same hope. They should not be facing fear, they should be learning and growing, imagining who they can be, and what their contributions to our country could be as well. We've got to take action, we've got to start now, not tomorrow, not next year, now. We know we can't solve all these problems over night, which means we don't have a moment to lose.\nProverbs tells us, 'Where there is no vision, the people perish.' So let's hold on to a common vision. Let's come together to make America a place where every child, no matter who they are, where they're born or what they look like, has the chance to live up to their God-given potential.\nBeing stronger together with this common vision means rejecting those forces that try to pit us against each other. We can acknowledge that implicit bias still exists, not just in police departments but throughout our country, without vilifying police officers. We can call for reforms to policing, while still appreciating the many courageous and admirable officers out there who are doing their jobs with honor and integrity.\nI think about an officer named Montrell Jackson. You might not have heard of him, but I want you to. He was one of the officers murdered in Baton Rouge. A few days before he died, he wrote on Facebook, he was black but he wore blue. 'In uniform,' he wrote, 'I get nasty, hateful looks. Out of uniform, some consider me a threat. These are trying times. Please don't let hate infect your heart.' And then he closed by saying that if anyone saw him on patrol and wanted a hug, 'I got you.'\nMontrell Jackson knew that making our communities safer and juster are not conflicting ideas. And most officers will tell you they can't do one without the other. I believe we need end-to-end reform in our criminal justice system, not half measures but full measures, with real follow-through. In America everyone should be respected by the law and have respect for the law.\nThat starts with being honest. Being unafraid to face the facts. Face the fact that black men are far more likely to be stopped, searched by police, charged with crimes and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men for doing the same thing. We need to fix a system where too many black parents are taken from their kids and imprisoned for minor offenses. We need to make sure our police officers are trained in de-escalating tense situations. We need to dismantle the so-called school-to-prison pipeline, and instead invest in education from early childhood through high school into higher education. And yes we have got to fight for common sense reforms to stop the epidemic of gun violence in our communities.\nGun violence is by far the leading cause of death for young black men, more than the next nine causes combined. We've got to make sure there are good jobs, equality affordable housing in every zip code in America. We need to make investments in communities that have been left out and left behind. I am a strong supporter of Congressman Jim Clyburn's plan to put 10 percent of our federal funds into 20 percent of the communities that have generational poverty for 30 years or more.\nNow, there are some out there who see this as a moment to command the flames of resentment and division. Who want to exploit people's fears, even though it means tearing our nation even further apart. They say that all of our problems will be solved simply by more 'law and order.' As if the systemic racism plaguing our country doesn't exist. Now, of course we need safe neighborhoods, no one is against that. Of course, we need communities that are free from the epidemic of gun violence, of course we need that. But we also need justice and dignity and equality, and we can have both. This is not an either-or question for America.\nI want us to commit ourselves to this common vision. That is where I will build on the work that President Obama has done. And I will be sure that this is not just about a campaign or an election. This is much bigger than an election. These are issues I've been fighting for since I was a young lawyer working for the Children's Defense Fund. Going to South Carolina to try to get young teenagers, 13, 14-year-olds out of jails with adult offenders. I care deeply about this because it's not just personal to so many of us, it's about the kind of country you want to be and the future we want for all of our children and grandchildren. I think about that every time I see my grandchildren or every time I see a bright, energetic, impressive young woman like Zianna. Come up here a minute, would you?\nI love your dress.\nYou know, God loves us all, right? We are called to care for and cherish each other. It's not easy, it is not. But that is our mission and that is what we are called to do, not only as Christians but as Americans, as human beings to understand and respect each other. To fight for each other's children, each other's dignity, each other's opportunity as if they were our own. Now, make no mistake, this is not easy work. You've been doing this since Adam and Eve came here. But it is righteous work. Protecting all of God's children is America's calling. Remember what scripture also tells us: 'Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.' We will not grow weary and we will not lose heart. We will get up every single day have faith in one another and in our future and work for that better day for all of God's people. Thank you.\"", "timestamp": "2016-10-02", "title": "Remarks at Little Rock AME Zion Church in Charlotte, North Carolina"}

It's just fabulous being back here again. I am so grateful to all of you. I want to thank your mayor, Mayor Horrigan. Thank you for welcoming me here. I want to thank two great members of Congress who fight for Akron, fight for Cleveland, fight for Youngstown, fight for Ohio and America, Congresswoman Marcia Fudge and Congressman Tim Ryan.\nNow, I'm pretty excited about being here today. And I was especially honored to receive the endorsement of LeBron James. Now, I may become president, but he will be king of Ohio for as long as there is a king. I'm obviously delighted to be endorsed by someone who has demonstrated such leadership and such extraordinary ability. But I'll tell you what really moved me the most is he's given back to his hometown. He has advocated for small businesses, for kids, giving kids more opportunities. He's spoken out on behalf of criminal justice reform. He is someone who uses the platform he has earned because he has worked so hard over so many years to speak out and speak up for those who may not have a voice. So I am truly honored to have his support, and especially to be able to tell people in his hometown how I am looking forward not just to watch him play basketball, but to continue to be a leader in so many different ways.\nNow, we do have an important election coming up. Who here is planning to vote? Well, that is very good news because this is the most consequential election, I think, in our lifetimes. The choice could not be clearer, and we need everybody to show up. And how many of you still have to register to be able to vote? Everybody here registered? Well, I want you to talk to your friends because the deadline for registering in Ohio is October 11th. That's just a little over a week away. And if you're not sure whether or not someone you know is registered, or maybe you yourself want to be absolutely positive, you can go to iwillvote.com – see that sign over there? You can go to iwillvote.com and confirm your registration and register if you need to.\nSo let's get everybody you know to register and maybe start voting when early voting starts on October the 12th because we have just 36 days left. Thirty-six days, now, we are reaching out. We're making phone calls. We're knocking on doors. If you want to get involved, you can go to my website, hillaryclinton.com. Sign up to be part of this campaign in the next 36 days. You can text 'join,' j-o-i-n, at 47246, and get involved, because we are running to win Ohio in this election.\nAnd everybody, everybody in the campaign, is crisscrossing Ohio. My daughter's been here a bunch. Tim Kaine and his wonderful wife Anne have been here. My husband's coming back tomorrow for a two-day bus tour through Ohio. And I will be back because we care about Ohio and we want to make sure Ohio makes the best choice for the future of the people of this great state.\nNow, I'm going to close this campaign the way that I started my career a long time ago, fighting for kids and families, standing up for people who may need a little extra boost in life, making sure that this country delivers on the promise of the American dream. See, I believe the American dream is big enough for everybody. If you're willing to work for it and do your part, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead in America.\nNow, my opponent and I have a really different view about what it takes to get ahead and stay ahead, and that may be because we have very different life experiences. And that's okay. People have different families, different views of the world. But here's what I have noticed. I have noticed that he always puts himself first. And maybe that's because he was born into a millionaire family. He started his business with a $14 million loan from his father. His father bailed him out; apparently that's a pattern, you got to be bailed out when you do business with him. And he then has taken advantage of every single element of our tax code, of our economy, that he could.\nAnd along the way, along the way, he has stiffed people – small businesses and workers and contractors. And that's part of the reason I take this election so seriously. My dad was a small businessman. My grandfather was a factory worker. And so my dad, when he got out of the Navy in World War II, he started a small business. He started a printing business. He printed fabrics for draperies. And he worked really hard. He had a print plant in Chicago – no natural light, no windows, just a long room where there were two big, long tables, and the fabric would be laid out on them. And then if you've ever seen silkscreens, that's what he did. You take the silkscreen. You put it down. You pour the paint in. You take the squeegee. You go across. You lift it up. You go down to the end of one long table, you start on the end of the other long table. And then, if it was going to be two colors, you would add another color, doing exactly the same thing. It was before there was machines. My dad couldn't have afforded that anyway. But he worked really hard, and he produced a good middle class life for our family.\nAnd so when I think about the way that my opponent has taken advantage of people, I got to tell you, I am really grateful my dad never got a contract from him, because I have met people he stiffed. I have met people. I'm talking painters and plumbers. I'm talking dishwashers, marble installers, glass installers, architects, a man who sold him pianos for one of his casinos. He wouldn't pay them. Now, you got to stop and ask yourself, what kind of person does that? Somebody who works hard and has a contract which they expect to be honored.\nAnd so I met one of the men. I met a man who had a small family business, installed the glass in one of those casinos, submitted the bill, and Trump said, no. we're not going to pay it. And the man was stunned, as so many hundreds and hundreds of people have been. And then they come back, the Trump organization or Trump himself, and say, okay, we'll give you 10 cents, 20 cents, maybe 30 cents on the dollar. Now, some of those small businesses, they couldn't afford that. They had bought the material, They had provided the services. Trump didn't care. He basically just walked away from them, made them feel like they had failed even though they had done the work they'd been asked to provide. I got to tell you, that is not the way we're supposed to do business in America. And I can't imagine having a president who believes that that's the way you're supposed to treat people. But you're going to help me make sure he never gets near the White House.\nNow, earlier today, earlier today in Toledo, I talked about all of the changes I want to make in how we can protect Americans from the kind of corporate fraud that we have seen too much of. Now, the most recent example is Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo actually had people, thousands of their employees, putting customers into accounts they either never asked for or they did not understand. And then every time they put somebody into a new account, they got fees, which then gave them the chance to get a bigger bonus – a really crummy game that hurt people. So thankfully, we have an organization now, the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau in Washington, who looks out for people who get [...]. That is an important part of how we're going to protect. And it's run, you may know, by Richard Cordray from Ohio.\nNow, will it surprise you that Donald Trump wants to eliminate that agency? Well, we're not going to let that happen. That agency has already recovered $11 billion for consumers who've been taken advantage of by corporations. And the behavior of Wells Fargo shows clearly that we have got to keep the pressure on these big banks so they can never wreck the economy again the way they did back in 2008.\nI have said we're never going to let Wall Street wreck Main Street again, and I mean it. Contrast that – contrast that with my opponent. He wants to do away with the rules that have been imposed on Wall Street. He basically wants to let Wall Street, the banks, the hedge funds, all these other institutions basically do whatever they want again. Well, I'll tell you what, we're not going to let that happen. We need more rules, not fewer rules on them.\nI want us to make it easier to start a small business, to get rid of the red tape, to make credit available, to make it clear that most new jobs are going to come from small businesses in America, so we should have a big, dynamic small business economy. But we are not going to let big business and big corporations call the shots anymore. That is not working for us.\nBut Trump's whole economic vision is really trickle-down economics. It's the same – the same idea that has failed us before. You see, he believes that all you do is cut taxes on the wealthy and then it trickles down. Well, we know that doesn't work. We've been down that road. And what he wants to do is, I think it's fair to say, trickle-down on steroids. What he has proposed would slash taxes on the wealthy.\nNow, I'm a little confused about this because for a long time we've been saying, 'Hey, where are your tax returns?' A lot of us wondered what he was hiding. Because you know, if it was something that would make him look good, he would put them right out there. Everybody who's ever run for president in at least the last 40 years has released their tax returns. My husband and I have about 40 years of tax returns out there. You can go and look at them and you can see that we paid a lot of taxes, and frankly, we were grateful we could. We are grateful for the blessings that we've had over the last 15 years.\nSo did any of you see the debate last Monday? Well, I raised it. I said, 'Well, maybe he doesn't want us to see that he owes hundreds of millions of dollars to foreign banks and foreign lenders, or maybe he hasn't paid any taxes.' Now, shortly after the debate, it was discovered that, indeed, back in the 1990s he apparently lost a billion dollars on bad investments and failing casinos. Ask yourself this: Who loses money on casinos? Really. And yesterday some of his supporters said, 'Well, it just shows he's a genius that he didn't pay any taxes.' Well, what kind of genius loses a billion dollars in the first place?\nIn the debate, he said not paying taxes made him smart. But think about what that means. It means that all the rest of us who pay our taxes, right – what's he saying about us? But more than that, zero taxes means zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for Pell Grants to send young people to college, zero for health, zero for education. And you stop and ask yourself, this is the same person who's been going around really just dumping on America. He says our military's a disaster. Well, he could not be more wrong, but thank goodness the rest of us paid to support our men and women in uniform who have done so much for us.\nToday in Colorado, he claimed he brilliantly used the laws to avoid paying taxes. Well, that just shows, number one, he is the poster boy – the poster boy – for the same rigged system that he would make even worse. Just think about it. He paid zero at least for about 20 years, we believe now based on what we know. And he's advocating for huge tax cuts that would help him and his family even more. What's he want us to do, pay him to lose money? Really?\nThere's a lot more to this story, and we're just slowly getting it into the public eye. So we know he's stiffed people, didn't pay his bills. We know he took bankruptcy, depending on how you count, four or six times. You know that he paid no taxes for probably 20 years. We don't know what his taxes would be after that. He's always talked about how he can't release his taxes because he's under audit, but he admitted everything before 2009 is not under audit, so Donald, release everything up until 2009. Show the American people your taxes.\nI'll tell you another thing. If I'm fortunate enough to be president, we're going to pass a law requiring anybody who is a nominee of a major national party to have to release their taxes.\nSo what did we find out today? Well, a story just came out saying that Donald Trump used Chinese steel and aluminum for two out of the last three construction projects. So instead of buying his steel and aluminum from American plants here in Ohio and Pennsylvania, instead of supporting hardworking families and American jobs, he once again stiffed us. He sent that money overseas.\nNow, he spends a lot of time bashing the Chinese, right? You hear that all the time when he talks. Well, it turns out he bought his steel and aluminum from the Chinese. It turns out he owes big money to the Chinese. So this is another one of the episodes of his reality television show, where he is saying one thing and doing something else.\nNow, for years, China has been undermining American businesses and workers by illegally dumping cheap aluminum and steel into our markets. You know that, right? And it sounds like Donald Trump has been buying that dumped steel and aluminum. How can he make America great again when he won't even buy American products in our country?\nAnd I'll tell you, this is personal to me, because as a senator I went before the International Trade Commission on behalf of steel workers in New York who I represented. And as Secretary of State, I went toe-to-toe with the Chinese. I have put forward an agenda to crack down on trade abuses from countries like China, to stand up for American workers, and to rebuild American infrastructure with American materials like steel and aluminum.\nAnd today in Toledo I pointed out, because Chrysler just announced an expansion of the plant there for the new Jeep Wrangler – about 700 more jobs, right? I pointed out when the automobile industry was flat on its back and 850,000 workers in Ohio could have been absolutely out of a job – more than we can even imagine in terms of the long-lasting impact on the economy here – Donald Trump said he didn't care. Save it, don't save it; didn't matter to him.\nWell, I'll tell you where I stood. I stood in favor of saving the American automobile industry. And look what we got. Last year, our auto industry had the best year they've had in a really long time. And so we've got to keep building it. We've got to keep making sure that there are good jobs. And we've got to protect good union jobs against the kind of assault that is coming from all sides.\nSo now, I know that Ohio is a tough, tough state. You've got to get out there. You've got to talk to people, answer questions, make your case. That's what we've been doing. That's what we're going to do all the way to the end of this election. But I need your help to talk to anybody you know here who thinks they might be voting for Trump. I know you know people. I know you do. And you've got to stage an intervention. You've got to sit them down and point out how everything he says he wants to do is absolutely opposite of what he has done, and how everything he has proposed will help people like him and his family but not the vast majority of families in Ohio. In fact, if you look at his tax proposals, they benefit him and other wealthy people – hedge fund managers and the like, and they would actually raise taxes on middle-class families.\nNow, that's the kind of contrast we're getting out in the campaign, but that's why we need your help – to make sure you go out and talk to everybody. And I know people want change. That's part of the American dynamic spirit. We want change. Well, I'll tell you, one thing that is certain is we'll have change – it's just what kind of change. It's whether or not we have change that helps the vast majority of Americans, hardworking Americans, middle-class families, or continues to only help those at the top. I want an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. And that's exactly what we're going to fight for, and that is what we're going to get.\nI'll tell you, I've been called a lot of things. Right? I've never been called quitter. If I tell you I'm going to get up every day and fight for you, that is exactly what I will do.\nBut I know I can't do it – I can't do it alone. Donald Trump stood on the stage of his convention and just once again painted this dark and dire picture of America. And then he said, 'I alone can fix it.' He gets confused between leadership and dictatorship. He has a hard time remembering who our friends are and who our adversaries are. He has a weird fascination with dictators like Vladimir Putin. We have a lot of people living in this part of Ohio who either themselves or their parents or grandparents came from countries that were under the yoke of oppression, and we're never going to let that happen again.\nAnd so when Trump basically signs up for Putin's wish list, that's bad enough. But then, when he's cavalier – and I'm not talking about basketball – when he is cavalier about nuclear weapons, saying that, oh, he doesn't care if other countries get them; in fact, you know, if there were a nuclear war in East Asia, if Japan got nuclear weapons, if South Korea got nuclear weapons, hey, just go at it, folks. He even said he wouldn't care if Saudi Arabia got nuclear weapons. One thing that has been a bedrock of American foreign policy through Democratic and Republican presidents going back to the dawn of the atomic age is we were committed to trying to keep other countries from getting access to nuclear weapons, to be able to stop proliferation. And now it's even more important because it's not only states that we have to worry about, like North Korea; we've got to worry about terrorists getting their hands on nuclear weapons. The last thing we want to do is just act like it doesn't matter, because it does.\nI was involved in putting together the sanctions against Iran that drove them to the negotiating table. And what I learned – if you use diplomacy and you're tough about it, you can actually get an agreement that put a lid on their nuclear program. And we're going to make sure they follow it to the period, the comma, everything in that agreement. I'm going to enforce. And we still have challenges with Iran, but I think we're in a stronger position given the fact that they are not racing for a nuclear weapon because we have intrusive inspections.\nSo I know diplomacy can work because I've done it, and I know that – we can defeat ISIS and the terrorists if we work with other nations, if we have a coalition that actually takes them out from the air, takes them out on the ground, and fights them online where they are doing so much damage by radicalizing and recruiting young people. I've been laying out my plan for what I think it will take to defeat ISIS, and I have no doubt we will. And Donald says he has a secret plan. That he won't tell us about. Well, there's no secret; he has no plan.\nAnd we've got to do more – we've got to do more to make sure we protect our country. We need the best intelligence we can get, the best cooperation among law enforcement at all levels of government. I will not rest. As a former Senator from New York on 9/11, I take this as a personal responsibility. I will do everything I can to keep our country safe and to work with others to defeat the threat posed by terrorism.\nAnd finally, my friends, we've got to bring our country back together. There is too much divisiveness, too much finger-pointing and scapegoating. Our diversity is one of our strengths. We have to listen to each other. We don't have to agree; that is not required. But we need to be respectful. We need to listen. And then we need to roll up our sleeves and get to work.\nWhen I was First Lady, Senator, Secretary of State, I worked to find common ground with everybody. I worked when I was First Lady with Republicans and Democrats to create the Children's Health Insurance Program that insures eight million kids. When I was in the Senate, I worked with practically every Republican I served with. And they all have nice things to say about me when I'm not running for something. And I will work again to move our country forward and to change the [...] of that. And we had to get 13 Republicans, and I worked tirelessly and we got them. We did that. There is a lot we can do if we start listening and respecting each other and avoid the kind of name-calling and insults that we see too much of.\nSo I'm excited about the campaign, but I'm even more excited about getting to work for you – being able to get up every day and find a way to try to help somebody. I mean, that is how I was raised in my church and by my family, and that is what I have done through my advocacy work and my legal work on behalf of people who needed a voice. And I will do everything possible to make sure I deliver results for you. And the reason that I have published a book with my great running mate, Tim Kaine – it's right here – is real simple: I want you to know what we say we're going to do, because I want you to hold me accountable. I don't believe in bait and switch, where I say, oh, we're going to do something and then I really am over here doing something else. That kind of reminds you of somebody, doesn't it? No, here's what we're going to try to do. We're going to pay for it by raising taxes on the wealthy and closing loopholes on corporations. And I am the only candidate who ran this whole campaign saying I will never raise taxes on the middle class. That is not going to happen when I am president.\nSo please join this campaign in the last 36 days. Talk to your friends. Remember, friends don't let friends vote for Trump. I am motivated every day because now I'm a grandmother – two beautiful grandchildren – and I think about their future, I think about their lives, I think about our country. I want our country to be the land of opportunity. The place where dreams do come true if you're willing to work for them. Not just for my grandchildren, but for every child. I want every child in this country to have a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. And if you will help me win this election, and then help me work to make it come true, we will have a country that delivers on our dreams and a future we can all be proud of.\nThank you and God bless you!\"", "timestamp": "2016-10-03", "title": "Remarks at Goodyear Hall and Theater in Akron, Ohio"}

Secretary Clinton was introduced by Kenyetta Jones, member of UAW Local 14.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119154", "text": "\"Hello, Toledo. I am – I am very happy to be here today and – I am so grateful to have this chance to talk to you about what we can do together to have the kind of economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.\nI want to acknowledge – we have an overflow crowd in another room, and I know they can hear us, but we're glad they're here. I want to thank your Congresswoman, Marcy Kaptur, for her leadership and her grit. I want to thank Mayor Paula Hicks-Hudson. And the mayor told me there's a young man here who just won a boxing championship, Robert Easter. Where's Robert Easter? There you are, Robert Easter. Congratulations. I know Toledo is proud of you; we all are. I want to thank Kenyetta for that introduction. Do we have any other UAW members here?\nIt's a great day to be here in Ohio for a lot of different reasons. One is I am so thrilled that LeBron James has endorsed me and joined our campaign. I know – I've gotten a lot of wonderful endorsements over the past year and a half. I'm grateful for each and every one of them. But I got to say, there's something special about this one. And it's a real honor in part because of why he chose to endorse me. Now, not everyone knows this. I mean, you all know what an amazing athlete he his – MVP, winner of championships – but he's also – LeBron is also a dedicated advocate for children. And this afternoon I'll be in Akron, where he's done so much for the kids in that community.\nIt's a deep, personal commitment that he has that I share with him. We both believe every single child should have the chance to live up to his or her God-given potential. I could not be prouder to have LeBron joining our team as we head into the homestretch.\nNow, one thing I know – I'll just say it because I know it's for sure – I hope to be elected president, but I know here in Ohio LeBron will always be the King.\nI was listening to Kenyetta introduce me, and I really appreciated what she said, because Toledo is the kind of place where people work hard, look after one another, and yes, pay their taxes, right?\nYou recognize that we all have to do our part because we are all in this together, and it matters.\nWe believe honest work deserves honest pay. We believe everyone should have the right to join a strong union that will always have your back.\nIt's personal for me. I'm the granddaughter of a factory worker from Scranton, Pennsylvania. He went to work in the same lace mill every day for 50 years. He believed he passed it down to my dad, who passed it down to me that if he did what he was supposed to do, he'd have a good life and his kids would have an even better life. That is the American dream. That is what we believe in. That's what we've got to keep going generation after generation.\nAnd because of my grandfather's hard work, my dad made it to college. And then after serving in the Navy during World War II, he started his own small business, printing fabric for draperies.\nAs a young girl, I'd sometimes go to his print plant. It was a long building, no natural light, no windows, but he had these long tables where he'd roll out the fabric and then I'd watch him work with silkscreens, if you've ever seen that. He would take the silkscreen, he'd put it down, he'd pour the paint in, he'd take the squeegee, go across all the way down to the end of one table, then over to the next table, all the way back. And then if there was a second color to be added, he would do that. He sometimes let me help with the squeegee. That was my favorite part.\nAnd I know he worked really hard. He worked really hard. He believed in hard work. He passed that on to me. He provided a good middle-class life for us. So I am proud to stand with hardworking families all over Toledo, Ohio, and America, who should have the same chance that I did to share in the American Dream, which should be big enough for everybody.\nFighting for kids and families has been the cause of my life, as Kenyetta said, when I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund all those years ago. And it will be the mission of my presidency, because I want to focus on what are called kitchen table issues, the ones that keep you up at night – like the cost of child care, and college, and prescription drugs, and so much else.\nAnd that means we've got to create more good jobs with rising incomes. That means we've got to have good schools in every zip code. That means everybody willing to work – and I say that very clearly; you've got to be willing to work – and if you're willing to work, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead. That is the basic bargain.\nNow, I don't know about you, but you wouldn't think that the theme of my campaign, 'getting an economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top' would be controversial – and yet this is one of the defining debates not just of this election but of our time.\nNow, I will say, most American companies – most – are run by honorable, patriotic people who care about their employees and communities. But there are still too many powerful interests fighting to protect their own profits and privileges at the expense of everyone else. [Applause.] And they are aided and abetted by the rules and incentives in our economy who actually encourage people at the top to take advantage of consumers, workers, small businesses, and taxpayers.\nThat makes it tougher for the well-meaning CEOs to take the high road. And it gets even harder when we don't aggressively enforce the rules, when we don't enforce trade rules that allow other countries with lower wages and standards to get an unfair leg up, when we don't enforce rules on Wall Street, which exerts enormous pressure on publicly traded companies to prioritize boosting share prices in the short term over building real value, investing in workers, plant, and equipment over the longer term.\nAnd let's be honest, the tax code rewards corporations for outsourcing jobs and their profits overseas instead of investing here in the United States. And it is riddled with loopholes that let the rich get even richer and make income inequality even worse. It tilts the playing field further against small businesses that can't afford lawyers and lobbyists.\nSo with all these pressures pushing in the wrong direction, it's even more important that we have an election about these very issues. Because what I know will happen – if we have an election where we have an agenda that actually would begin to level that playing field, we will rebuild the middle class, we will make work pay, we will create greater opportunities for a great percentage of Americans.\nNow, I know how hard this, but I think we are on the cusp, if we win this election, to be able to get these things done, right?\"\nAudience: \"Yeah.\"\nClinton: \"That means pursuing reforms that unleash the enormous positive potential of the American private sector. We've got unmatched talent, innovation, entrepreneurial spirit.\nSo when we work together, we can all benefit.\nNow, I believe corporations that benefit from everything America has to offer should feel some sense of responsibility not just to their biggest shareholders – but to their workers, to their customers, to their communities, and yes, to our country, to the United States of America. We have been moving off track for decades. I don't need to tell you that. You know it, you've lived it, you've seen it. But it is time to get back on track.\nAnd you can ask anybody who's ever worked for me or worked with me, who's ever served with me, when I tell you I'm going to try to do something, I will get up every single day and work my heart out for you.\nSo let's begin by making it clear that for most businesses, America is the most important asset on their balance sheet. This country of ours, this system of ours, the rule of law, the opportunity to get an education and go as far as your hard work and ambition will take you. And we created the biggest engine of economic growth in the world, the American middle class. So when we middle class thrives, the country thrives. And when it doesn't, we don't, right?\nAnd I'm going to use the White House and every tool at my disposal as your president to make the case that patriotism is profitable. Standing up for America, investing in America will pay off.\nNow, we have always had innovators and entrepreneurs who build great companies and create real value. But we should not and we will not respect those who get rich by cheating everybody else.\nSo today I want to send a clear message to every boardroom, every executive suite across America: If you scam your customers, exploit your employees, pollute our environment, or rip off taxpayers, we will find ways to hold you accountable.\nBut on the other side – on the other side, if you do the right thing and you invest in your workers and your communities and our country's future, we will stand with you. That is the choice. Our goal is to make it easier for everyone to do better.\nNow, to understand why this is so important, consider the recent examples we've seen of egregious corporate behavior.\nLook at Wells Fargo. Really shocking, isn't it? One of the nation's biggest banks bullying thousands of employees into committing fraud against unsuspecting customers, secretly opening up millions of accounts for people without their consent, even their knowledge, misusing personal information, and then sticking customers with hidden fees. It is outrageous that eight years after a cowboy culture on Wall Street wrecked our economy, we are still seeing powerful bankers playing fast and loose with the law.\nAnd then in a category by himself, there's Donald Trump. Well, you may have heard that he has long refused to release his tax returns the way every other nominee for president has done for decades. You can look at 40 years of my tax returns. I think we need a law that says if you become the nominee of the major parties, you have to release your tax returns.\nNow, a lot of us were wondering, what is he hiding? It must be really terrible. Well, The New York Times has discovered at least part of the answer. Back in the 1990s, Trump apparently lost a billion dollars in a single year on bad investments and failing casinos. Now, how anybody can lose a dollar, let alone a billion dollars, in the casino industry is kind of beyond me. It's just hard to figure. But as a result, it doesn't look like he paid a dime of federal income tax for almost two decades.\nNow, while millions of American families, including mine and yours, were working hard paying our fair share, it seems he was contributing nothing to our nation. Imagine that. Not fair. Nothing for Pell Grants to help kids go to college. Nothing for veterans. Nothing for our military. And you know, he has been dissing America in this whole campaign. Right? He talks us down. He makes disparaging comments about our country. He calls our military a disaster. Well, it's not, but it might have been if everybody else had failed to pay taxes to support our brave men and women in uniform.\nI saw a newspaper article. A gentleman named Steve Crouse, who owns the Glass City Cafй here in Toledo, summed it up pretty well in this article. He said, 'I would feel guilty if I didn't pay anything. It's flat-out cheating the government.' Now, my friend Bernie Sanders was right yesterday when he said Trump reflects a distorted view of the American people and what this country is all about.\nTrump represents the same rigged system that he claims he's going to change. The whole story tells us everything we need to know about how Trump does business. After he made all those bad bets and lost all that money, he didn't lift a finger to help and protect his employees, or all the small businesses and contractors he'd hired, or the people of Atlantic City. They all got hammered while he was busy with his accountants trying to figure out how he could keep living like a billionaire. And all the while he was using his political connections to collect hundreds of millions of dollars in government subsidies and extra tax breaks for his companies. In other words, Trump was taking from America with both hands and leaving the rest of us with the bill.\nNow, he says that he's the one who can fix things, but that is like letting the fox guard the henhouse. Right? And here's what I really am just stunned by. I get stunned every day in this campaign. But here's one of the many things that I'm stunned by. He has put forth a tax plan that would cut his own taxes even more. It would be like you're paying zero. You expect us to pay you to stay in business, all the rest of us in America? He'd open the loopholes even wider. And according to a new independent study, he would actually – listen to this, people, because this is a real shocker – his plan would actually raise taxes for millions of middle class families. And you know the people it would hit the hardest? Are single parents, whose lives and challenges he doesn't care about, certainly doesn't understand.\nNow, many have likely already spent years paying more than he did, and he now would make that even worse. And what does he say about it? Well, did you all see the debate last Monday? Well, in the debate – in the debate – well, then you all know that in the debate he said it was smart to avoid paying taxes. Yesterday his campaign was bragging it makes him a genius. Here's my question: What kind of genius loses a billion dollars in a single year?\nThis is Trump to a T. He's taken corporate excess and makes a business model out of it. He abuses his power, games the system, puts his own interests ahead of the country's. It's Trump first and everyone else last. And there are lots of principled, law-abiding business leaders out there who are horrified by all of this. Not a single – not a single CEO of a Fortune 100 company supports Trump's campaign. Think about it. I've been endorsed by very successful people – Warren Buffett, Mike Bloomberg, Mark Cuban. I loved what Mark Cuban said when he endorsed me. He said, 'Look, I've been successful.' He actually is a real billionaire. And you know what? He used profit-sharing to help his employees, not bankruptcy to fire people. And when he sold his first company, he shared the profits with his employees, and 300 of them became millionaires. That's the kind of business practices I want to see more of in our country.\nBut here's what we've got to do. Even if Trump is like one of a kind, we've got to reverse the broader trends he represents. It's time to rewrite the rules and make this economy fair for everyone. And today I want to briefly share with you my plan for protecting taxpayers, consumers, small businesses, and workers. We're going to crack down on the worst corporate abuses and empower companies willing to take the high road and invest in good jobs, in higher wages, and in stronger communities.\nFirst let's start with protecting taxpayers and making sure we have more fairness in the system. It is wrong that corporations and the super-wealthy play by a different set of rules. A Wall Street money manager should not be able to pay a lower tax rate than a teacher or a nurse. And I'll tell you something else. Our largest companies should not be able to get away with paying hardly anything at all. It is insulting when they engage in these games, like moving their headquarters over to a foreign country – on paper, not in reality – just to take advantage of lower tax rates. And it is infuriating when they take tax breaks with one hand and give out pink slips in America with the other hand.\nSo here's what we're going to do. We're going to close those loopholes. I've got a list of them we're going after. We're going to make Wall Street corporations and the super-rich start paying their fair share of taxes. We're going to pass something called the Buffett rule, which means multimillionaires cannot lower rates than their secretaries and other people working for them. We're going to put in place a new exit tax. If companies try to leave our country to avoid paying their fair share, if they try to outsource jobs, they're going to have to give back every tax break they ever received in our country. And then we're going to put that money to work creating opportunities here in America.\nSecond, we're going to protect consumers. No American should ever be taken advantage of, like thousands were, by Wells Fargo. And this isn't a new fight for me. As a Senator, I raised the alarm about subprime mortgages. I fought to hold reckless managers accountable for toxic toys and household products that threaten our kids. I introduced legislation to protect Americans' personal data and combat identity theft. So as president, I will make consumer protection a top priority across the entire government.\nAnd that starts by defending and empowering the Consumer Financial Protection Bu-reau, which was created after the financial crisis. And the principal person who got it created was Senator Elizabeth Warren. And under the leadership of Ohio's Rich Cordray, the agency has already returned more than $11 billion to more than 15 million Americans who were ripped off by predatory lenders, credit card companies, and others. And it is the one making sure that the defrauded Wells Fargo customers get their money back.\nNow, I got to say I am so proud of what this new agency has done. Sometimes people say, well, what does the government really do? Well, there's a lot of examples, but this is a primary one, standing up and making sure consumers get paid back when they are ripped off. And because of its success, Republicans in Congress keep trying to shut it down. And Donald Trump agrees with them. In fact, he wants to scrap all the tough new rules imposed on Wall Street after the crisis. Well, not on my watch, Donald. We're never going to let that happen.\nNow, instead of gutting consumer protection, we should be expanding it. And we should build on the Dodd-Frank financial reforms and go even further because Wall Street can never, ever be permitted to threaten Main Street again. And the Wells Fargo scandal sheds light on another threat to consumers that we have to address. When the scam's victims, people like you and me, who had accounts there tried to sue, they were shocked to learn there was a provision in the very fine print of their contracts that kept them from going to court to sue the bank for being cheated. Instead, they are forced into a closed-door arbitration process without the important protections that you get in a court of law. We are not going to let corporations like Wells Fargo use these fine print \"gotchas\" to escape accountability.\nAnd in fact, this is now common practice across a lot of industries – from nursing homes, nursing homes that mistreat seniors, to for-profit colleges that defraud students. Who reads all that fine print? I don't. And you get defrauded or you get mistreated, and then all of a sudden they say, 'Well, you can't sue us.' So we're going to rein in that abuse across everybody.\nWe also see a similar problem in some international trade agreements, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. It sets up a dispute resolution system that favors large corporations over everyone else. It's one of the reasons I'm against it. I've warned about this for years, I've written about it, and I oppose TPP now, I will oppose it after the election, I will oppose it as president – because it is one-sided and unfair to American workers.\nAnd what about all those pharmaceutical companies that jack up prices for no reason? We're going to have to protect ourselves against that too. And when we find unjustified spikes in the prices of longstanding, life-saving drugs, we should slap penalties on companies trying to cheat people who need those drugs.\nAnd let's finally import safe alternatives from other countries, like Canada, and speed up approvals to get more generic drugs on the market. And it is long past time to allow Medicare to negotiate for better prices for drugs and get the cost down for Medicare recipients. And I believe we should cap the amount working families pay out of pocket every month for medicine. No one should ever have to choose between paying the rent and filling their prescriptions.\nSo let's stand up for taxpayers. Let's stand up for consumers. And let's stand up for small businesses, which create most of the jobs in America. I take this personally be-cause of my dad's very small business. We need fair rules of the road so big corporations can't use their power to gain unfair advantages.\nNow, when it comes to bullying small businesses, Donald Trump is the poster boy. I have heard so many stories of contractors, and I've met some too, who worked for him, produced the goods and services, and never got paid for what they were owed. I'm talking about painters, and plumbers, piano sellers, architects, glass installers – he stiffed them all. Not because he couldn't pay them, but he wouldn't pay them. And he told them, 'You want to get your money? Sue me.' My dad could never have done that. I'm just grateful my dad never got a contract with Donald Trump, because I don't know what we would have done.\nMore than 60 percent of small businesses face payment delays. That can cause a serious cash flow crisis. So as president, I will explore new ways to arm small businesses with the tools to fight back and level the playing field. Part of the problem is large corporations are amassing so much power in our economy. Sometimes it's called market concentration or even old-fashioned monopolies, but either way it threatens businesses of all sizes, as well as consumers. With less competition, corporations can use their power to raise prices, limit choice for consumers, cut wages for workers, crowd out startups and small businesses.\nI mean, look what's happening right now. In most of the country, the three largest health insurance companies in each state control 80 percent of the market. No wonder premiums are going up. As president, I will appoint tough, independent authorities to strengthen anti-trust enforcement and really scrutinize mergers and acquisitions, so the big don't keep getting bigger and bigger.\nI want every business to compete and thrive, and then I also want to do something else. Let's protect and empower workers who actually drive our economy. Everyone who works hard should be able to share in the rewards, not just senior executives. So we're proposing new tax credits to encourage more companies to share profits, on top of, not instead of, higher wages.\nWe need to support new organizing strategies for employees who too often have never had the benefit of collective bargaining. And we have to resist the assault on workers' rights. Let's say loudly and clearly: 'right to work' is wrong for workers and wrong for America.\nLet's also, my friends, let's raise the minimum wage and support the Fight for 15 so you don't live in poverty. Let's defend overtime and go after wage theft. Let's provide family leave that is paid and access to affordable, high-quality childcare. And of course you know what I'm going to say: let's finally guarantee equal pay for women.\nNow, my opponent and his chief surrogates like to say I'm playing the woman's card. And I'll tell you – right? – if fighting for working families is playing the women's card, you know what? Deal me in!\nAnd then finally, I've got a lot on my mind, but finally, we need to make it easier for companies to invest in good jobs here at home. As president, I will ramp up enforcement of trade rules by appointing a new chief trade prosecutor and tripling the number of enforcement officers. We will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II. I want to direct $10 billion to create a 'Make It in America' partnership to support American manufacturing. And I want to take some of the ideas that worked when my husband was President and we ended up with 23 million new jobs and incomes went up for everybody.\nThat includes incentives like the New Markets Tax Credit for creating good jobs in poor or remote areas, from inner cities to rural communities ravaged – ravaged – by hollowed-out factories, ravaged by mines that have been shut down, ravaged by opiate addiction. It all comes down to this: When I say our economy should work for everyone, not just those at the top, I mean it. And we're going to do everything we can to make sure workers are treated like assets, not costs. And we're going to bring back infrastructure jobs, advanced manufacturing jobs, clean, renewable energy jobs, innovation, technology, small business.\nNow, you don't have to look any further than right here in Northwest Ohio. Just a few years ago, as you heard Kenyetta say, in 2009 you were in the eye of the storm. Jobs, homes, savings, wiped out. The auto industry on the verge of collapse. A lot of people were ready to give up on it. Well, that would have meant giving up on 850,000 people across this state whose jobs were tied to the industry. Donald Trump, for one, said rescuing the auto industry didn't matter very much. Either way would have been acceptable, he said. 'We could have just let it go,' and that's a direct quote from him. Everybody in Ohio who's thinking about voting for Trump needs to hear that. At the time of the worst financial crisis in Ohio in 2009, he would have let you twist and fall. And for his running mate he picked Mike Pence, an ardent opponent of the auto rescue. Well, thank goodness the people of Northwest Ohio weren't ready to let it go. You never gave up. You didn't lose faith. And now, after a lot of hard work and sacrifice, the auto industry just had its best year ever.\nBut that's not all there is to the story because in addition to that hard work, America, America, came to the rescue. Taxpayers like all of us, not him but us, provided the funds for the rescue. Union workers stepped up. Communities like Toledo came together to make it work. And now that the industry's back on its feet, the auto companies have a responsibility to give back.\nSo I was delighted to hear that Chrysler is doubling down on Toledo, investing $700 million here to start building the next generation Jeep Wrangler, which could create about 700 new good jobs. And tens of thousands of UAW workers at Chrysler plants should see a big increase in profit-sharing payments above and beyond wages and benefits. Now, that's the way it's supposed to work, when we all help each other out. When we stand together, we are stronger together.\nSo what I want you to know is if you join me in this campaign, I will always stand up and fight for you and fight for your jobs and fight for your families. And I guess we have about 36 days left. The election's going to be close. Every call you make, every door you knock, every friend you register to vote, could make the difference. You can text 'join,' j-o-i-n, to 47246 right now or go to hillaryclinton.com to sign up and volunteer. Here in Ohio you have until October the 11th to register to vote. And there are people with clipboards around, and you can go actually register today on your way out the door.\nSo we have just over a week to register, and then early voting starts October 12th. Let's prove – let's prove – that the American dream is big enough for everyone to share in its promise. Let's prove that we're going to stand together, make the smart decisions that we get the economy going and growing for everybody, not just those at the top; that we will stand up against special privilege and special interest; that we will be ready after this election to have an agenda that will really make a difference here in Toledo and across Ohio. So I'm here asking for your help, asking for your work, asking for you to be part of this campaign, and then when we win on November 8, be part of changing our country for the better! Thank you all and God bless you!\"", "timestamp": "2016-10-03", "title": "Remarks at Martin Luther King, Jr., Plaza in Toledo, Ohio"}

That is because I know how overtaxed and overregulated the working people of this country are.\nA central issue I would like to address today is our broken tax code, an issue of concern to all Americans.\nAlong with securing our borders, rebuilding our military, keeping us safe from terrorism, redoing our trade deals and bringing back jobs, fixing the tax code is one of the main reasons I'm running for President.\nI've been saying from the beginning of this campaign how ridiculous, complex and yes, unfair, our tax system is. This is not the fault of the IRS, but the political class that is owned outright by the special interests and lobbyists.\nIt is these politicians who wrote the tax code, and who are constantly adding, revising, and changing, an already over-complicated set of laws – all at the behest of their favored donors and special interests.\nIt's thousands of pages long, and almost no one understands it. The average American would need an army of accountants and lawyers to wade their way through it.\nMany so-called experts, due to the sheer size and complexity of the code, don't have a clue what these pages represent.\nThe unfairness of the tax laws is unbelievable, it's something I've been talking about for a long time – despite being a beneficiary.\nI understand the tax laws better than almost anyone, which is why I am the one who can fix them – and that is what I commit to doing.\nAs a businessman and real estate developer, I have legally used the tax laws to my benefit, and to the benefit of my company and my employees.\nI have often said on the campaign trail, that I have a fiduciary responsibility to pay no more tax than legally required – or, put another way, to pay as little tax as legally possible.\nAs a major real estate developer in this country, and throughout the world, I face enormous taxes: city taxes, state taxes, sales and excise taxes, employee taxes, and federal taxes. It's my job to minimize the overall tax burden to the greatest extent possible – which allows me to reinvest in neighborhoods, workers, and build amazing properties which fuel tremendous growth in their communities – and always help our great providers of jobs, the small business.\nThe news media is now obsessed with an alleged tax filing from the 1990's, at the end of one of the most brutal economic downturns in our country's history.\nThe conditions facing real estate developers in the early nineties were almost as bad as the Great Depression of 1929 and far worse than the Great Recession of 2008.\nWhat had been a booming economy in the era of Ronald Reagan changed dramatically – and the business landscape changed with it: Bank failures, the collapse of the Savings & Loan industry, and the implosion of the retail market, and real estate in general.\nMany business people, including many of my competitors, were not able to survive. Companies, jobs, and opportunities were lost – and lives were destroyed, as tens of thousands of people were put out of work. Some of the biggest and strongest people and companies went bankrupt.\nYet today, my company is bigger, stronger, with far greater assets, and more premium properties, than ever before.\nThat did not happen by chance or luck – it happened by action, and talent.\nI was able to use the tax laws of this country, and my business acumen, to dig out of this real estate depression when few others did. In those most difficult times, when so many had their backs to the wall, I reached within myself and delivered for my company, my employees, my family and the communities where my properties existed.\nThose who spend their entire lives within the confines of government work, and who know virtually nothing of business, fail to understand the skill, dedication, and sheer grit it takes for a company to climb out of an economic depression of the scale we had in the early nineties. People like my opponent Hillary Clinton, whose only method of making money is by selling\ngovernment favors and granting access to special interests, know nothing about how businesses succeed and grow. Hillary Clinton has never created a single job in her entire life – or added a single dollar of value to the American economy. Hillary Clinton hasn't made an honest dollar in her entire life – all she does is take from you, from our country, and peddles influence to donors, special interests, and foreign actors – for astronomical dollars and like never before. It's corruption of the highest order.\nWhile I made my money as a highly-successful private businessman following the law, Hillary Clinton made her money as a corrupt public official breaking the law and putting her government office up for sale.\nBy her own account, Hillary Clinton left the White House dead broke, and now she and her husband have made more than $200 million dollars – without building a company, or creating a single thing of value.\nDuring the early nineties, as companies were collapsing left and right, the media and powers that be said Donald Trump could never make it back. They said I had billions of dollars in borrowing, and hundreds of millions in personal guarantees, and no pathway out.\nBut, I never had any doubts and never gave up.\nThat's because I knew in my heart that when the chips are down is when I perform at my very best. And when people make the mistake of underestimating me, that's when they are in for their biggest surprise.\nJust look at what happened in the primary. Just look at what our incredible movement is doing right now.\nThe reason I never felt endangered during the real estate downturn, was that I knew myself, I knew my business, I knew the financial system, I knew the tax code and, most importantly, I knew how to fight. That's what I am – a fighter, and I am now going to fight for you.\nWith my knowledge, I knew that I would make a comeback in business.\nThat is why I am here today. That is why I have left private business for public life – because I\nunderstand our country is in very bad shape. And now our country is in need of a major comeback – it needs one now more than ever.\nWe owe $20 trillion dollars in debt, but that's only part of the story – we have over $100 trillion dollars in unfunded liabilities, and we have a budget that's out of control with annual deficits. In addition, because of the incompetence of our leaders, we run massive trade deficits on an annual basis, now almost $800 billion a year.\nOur country is broke.\nWe have decaying infrastructure, failing schools, rising crime, a depleted military, an open border, and an economy that can't create full-time high-paying jobs. We are a divided nation, and each week it seems we are getting more and more divided, with race riots in our streets on a\nmonthly basis.\nThis is not the America that was handed down to us, and it's not the America we want for our children. And it's certainly not the America we want to pass down to our grandchildren. But this is the America we will have if we don't turn things around – starting today.\nWhat I say is not lost on the American people, because 70% of you believe our country is headed in the wrong direction.\nWe cannot have another 4 years of Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton will be worse.\nWe can turn this all around – but not if we don't make a change in leadership RIGHT NOW. The failed political establishment must go – it must go for the sake of your country, your future, and those you love the most.\nIn the early 90's, they splashed the front pages with stories about how I was finished. Everybody said that I was done – there were front page articles in the Wall Street Journal and New York Times. They were thrilled and delighted to write these negative stories.\nSo they said I was finished. The only person who didn't think that I was in trouble was Donald Trump.\nI started my company with a small loan and, as I grew, I borrowed money to grow the company. When the bottom fell out of the Real Estate market, I had all the debt, it stayed the same – but the value of the assets plummeted. But I knew how to use the tax code to rebuild my company when others did not.\nMy understanding of the tax code gave me a big advantage over those who didn't have a clue, including many of my competitors who lost everything they had, never to be heard from again.\nNow, they're gone, and I'm here and I'm ready to turn things around for this country.\nThe early 90's was a very tough time for the world, but in tough times you need tough people.\nThese are tough times for America today, and we need tough leaders. Not people who tell you what you want to hear, but people who tell you what you need to hear: we must never allow corrupt career politicians, like the Clintons, ever back into the White House again.\nThese tough times were when I performed my very best. The economy and banks collapsing, the government was a mess – but I enjoyed waking up every day to go to battle. I enjoyed getting up every morning to take on the financial establishment on behalf of my company and win. That's the thinking we need for our country – that's the thinking we need when we are negotiating trade deals, and military deals, and economic deals on behalf of the American people.\nPut me into the boardroom as YOUR representative, and I will deliver for you. Hillary Clinton is in it only for herself and her donors. I am here fighting for America.\nMany people have said that I perform better under pressure than anyone they've ever seen – I've proven that over and over again.\nThat's what I do. When the pressure is on, when the odds are stacked against me, when people say it can't be done – that's when I am just getting started.\nThe thing that motivates me the most is when people tell me something is impossible. For me, impossible is just a starting point.\nFrom the depths of that terrible real estate depression, I created a company worth billions and billions of dollars and created tens of thousands of jobs. Our company, and our employees, remade skylines, revitalized neighborhoods, rejuvenated communities, and hired thousands of workers.\nOn November 8th, America's comeback begins – and we are going to rise up from our present challenges bigger and better and stronger than ever before.\nThe people here in Pueblo know what it takes to rebuild this country.\nThis is a city with a rich immigrant history, and a rich Latino history, that has contributed so much to this country and this state. Though the people of Pueblo, and their families, have hailed from all regions of the world, you are united by this one thing: You are all Americans.\nAnd, as Americans, you are entitled to the same protections as every other American. Everyone lawfully living inside of our borders are entitled to the same things: safe communities, a great education, and access to high-paying jobs.\nThis is the change I will deliver. Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years and delivered nothing but failure. Her policies have brought death and destruction overseas, and poverty at home. She's brought massive poverty for everyone, but especially African-American and Hispanic Citizens.\nShe opposes school choice, and wants to trap poor African-American and Hispanic children in failing government schools. We are going to get poor minority children out of failing schools and into the public, private, charter or magnet school of their choice.\nHillary Clinton supports Obamacare, and wants to expand it – Obamacare is an absolute disaster. Premiums in Colorado are set to go up another 20 percent – the only way to stop this disaster is to vote Trump.\nHillary Clinton also supports the terrible trade deals, like Bill Clinton's NAFTA and China's entry into the World Trade Organization – and next she wants the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the deal she calls the \"Gold Standard.\"\nColorado has lost more than 1 in 7 manufacturing jobs since the NAFTA and China deals.\nBut while you've lost out, Hillary Clinton has raked in cash from her contributors. She and Bill have made $150 million in speeches to special interests. They gave 39 speeches to Big Banks, including $2 million in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs. The Clintons received another $2 million from a Swiss Bank after Hillary negotiated a favorable settlement for them as Secretary of State.\nTo hide her corruption, Hillary Clinton put her emails on an illegal secret server open to foreign hacking. Then she deleted and bleached 33,000 emails – after a congressional subpoena -- to hide them from the public. She lies to Congress, under oath, and her ringleaders took the fifth amendment and got immunity deals. It's worse than Watergate.\nThe investigation of Hillary Clinton was rigged, and it's a shame, and it's one of the saddest things that have ever taken place in our nation.\nWe have become a Banana Republic.\nNow, today, we learned, that the FBI made a side deal with Clinton's top aides to DESTROY\ntheir laptops.\nLet me repeat that: the FBI reportedly made a deal to DESTROY the laptops of government officials implicated in a massive criminal cover-up.\nHillary Clinton is the ringleader of a criminal enterprise that has corrupted our government at the highest levels, and the American people have one chance to stop it – by showing up and voting on November 8th.\nPeople have had it with the years, the decades of Clinton Corruption.\nThis is the year the American people say: Enough is Enough.\nThe Clintons are the sordid past. We are the bright future.\nNow, another issue I want to address today is immigration. As I mentioned, Pueblo is filled with wonderful hardworking immigrants. It is these hardworking immigrants who stand to lose the most from our open borders immigration policy.\nIllegal immigration, and broken visa programs, take jobs directly from Hispanic workers living here lawfully today.\nIllegal immigration also brings with it massive crime, and massive drugs – including a terrible heroin problem right here in Colorado.\nWe are going to build a border wall, and we are going to stop the drugs, gangs and the violence from pouring into Colorado.\nWe are going to shut down the Sanctuary Cities that have led to the preventable deaths of so many.\nCases like Kate Steinle, murdered in San Francisco by a 5-time deported illegal immigrant.\nOr cases like Sarah Root, killed by an illegal immigrant released at the border by President Obama – and then released again after the killing.\nThere are over 2 million criminal aliens in this county, and we are going to get them out – and we are going to get them out quickly.\nTo the cartels, the gangs, the drug dealers, I have a simple message for you: your days are numbered, and your reign of crime will soon come crashing to an end.\nWe also have to keep our country safe from terrorism. The terrorists who planted the bombs in New York and Jersey, and who carried out the mall stabbing in Minnesota, were foreign nationals admitted into our country – as was the mall shooter in Washington.\nOr look at cases like the Boston Bombers, here on asylum, or the San Bernardino Shooter, here on a fiancй visa from Saudi Arabia. Or the Orlando shooter, the son of a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan.\nTerrorists are infiltrating our country.\nNow, Hillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees and countless more refugees\nfrom across the Middle East.\nI want to keep you and your family safe.\nMy job is not to represent foreign countries. My job is to represent the citizens of the United States of America – putting your jobs, your wages, and your security first.\nIf you are living in the United States today as a lawful resident or U.S. citizen, I will ensure you have a safe community, rising wages, and secure immigration system.\nImmigration Security is National Security.\nHere are some more things we will do starting in 2017 –\nWe are going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare more affordable; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\nWe are going to rebuild America.\nWe are going to revitalize America.\nAnd we are going to unite America.\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\nTogether, we will make America wealthy again.\nWe will make America strong again.\nWe will make America safe again.\nAnd we will make America great again.\nThank you, and God Bless!", "timestamp": "2016-10-03", "title": "Remarks at the Pueblo Convention Center in Pueblo, Colorado"}

The fact that a former Senator and Secretary of State claimed not to know what the letter \"C\" means is just one more example of why she's unfit to hold public office.\nThe scope of our cyber security problem is enormous. Our government, our businesses, our trade secrets, and our citizens' most sensitive information are all facing constant cyber attacks.\nJust consider some of these recent hacks:\nJP Morgan Chase had 73 million emails stolen.\nE-Bay was invaded and gave up 150 million passwords.\nTarget was attacked and gave up 40 million credit card numbers.\nAttacks like these are happening on a regular basis both in the United States and around the world, and the costs in our privacy, our security and on our financial sector are extraordinary.\nIdentify theft, financial laundering, as well as ransom ware – involving the extortion of a hacked institution – are all becoming increasingly common.\nIncredibly, hackers were able to obtain at least 20 million identities of people who underwent FBI background investigations.\nThe information hacked contains facts discovered by the FBI in doing background checks for people seeking positions with the Federal Government. It is a treasure trove which can be easily used for blackmail.\nThe fact that this highly classified information was so poorly protected demonstrates that cyber security is just one more area where the Obama Administration has failed.\nWe should not let this be like the history of the Mafia which was allowed to grow into a nation-wide organization which infiltrated and corrupted so many areas of society for such a long time.\nWe can learn from this history that when the Department of Justice, the FBI, the DEA and state and local police and prosecutors were combined in Task Forces directed at the Mafia, they were able to have great success in prosecuting them, seizing their business interests and removing their infiltration from legitimate areas of society.\nAs President, I will instruct the Department of Justice to create Joint Task Forces throughout the United States to work together with Federal, State, and local law enforcement authorities and international law enforcement to crush this still-developing area of crime.\nI will make certain that our military is the best in the world in both cyber offense and defense. I will also ask my Secretary of Defense and Joint Chiefs to present recommendations for strengthening and augmenting our Cyber Command.\nAs a deterrent against attacks on our critical resources, the United States must possess the unquestioned capacity to launch crippling cyber counter-attacks. This is the warfare of the future, America's dominance in this arena must be unquestioned.\nCyber security is not only a question of developing defensive technologies but offensive technologies as well.\nFor non-state terror actors, the United States must develop the ability – no matter how difficult – to track down and incapacitate those responsible. We should turn cyber warfare into one of our greatest weapons against the terrorists.\nTo enhance the defense of the other agencies of government, including our law enforcement agencies, we will put together a team of the best military, civilian and private sector cyber security experts to comprehensively review all of our cyber security systems and technology.\nThe Cyber Review Team will proceed with the most sensitive systems first, but ultimately all systems will be analyzed and made as secure as modern technology permits.\nI will also require that follow-up reviews take place on a regular basis determined by the sensitive nature of the security involved.\nThe review will include providing exact recommendations for the best combination of defensive technologies tailored to specific agencies.\nThis will include the various methods of internal monitoring, attack and penetration, investigation of suspected hackers or rogue employees, and identity protection for government employees.\nThe review team will also remain current on the constantly-evolving new methods of attack, and will attempt to anticipate them and develop defenses as often as possible before major breaches occur.\nThis group of experts will set up protocols for each agency and government officials, requiring them to follow best practices.\nThey will also establish a training program for all government employees to make certain they understand what defenses are available and utilize them, along with a continuing education program so everyone is aware of the newest methods of both attack and defense.\nThose who violate classification rules will be held responsible to the fullest extent of the law. I will appoint an Attorney General who will reform the Department of Justice like it was necessary after Watergate. My Attorney General will restore the integrity of the Department of Justice.\nToday is just the beginning of a long and overdue national discussion of how to protect ourselves from modern cyber-crime and evolving national security threats, and how to develop the cyber offense strategies necessary to gain a critical security edge in the 21st century.", "timestamp": "2016-10-03", "title": "Remarks at the Budweiser Events Center in Loveland, Colorado"}
{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119461", "text": "After an ICIJ report that the Trump Organization rented office space to an Iranian bank linked to terrorist groups by U.S. authorities, Hillary for America Senior Policy Advisor Jake Sullivan released the following statement:\n\"Today's report that Trump's organization did business with a sanctioned Iranian bank—one that has played a role in supporting Iran's nuclear program and supported groups like Hezbollah and Hamas—shows yet again that Trump puts his own business interests ahead of the national interest. This report exposes Trump's hypocrisy on Iran. As with Cuba, he talks a big game but when it comes to making a buck, he'll deal with anyone. The conflicts of interest presented by Trump's business and his own desire to boost his bottom line above all else demonstrate clearly why voters should know more about Trump's business deals and what they mean for how he'll govern.\"\n?Please find the full article below:\nTrump's Organization Did Business With Iranian Bank Later Linked To Terrorism\nThe International Consortium of Investigative Journalists\nBy Dave Levinthal\nOctober 3, 2016\nDonald Trump's real estate organization rented New York office space from 1998 to 2003 to an Iranian bank that U.S. authorities have linked to terrorist groups and Iran's nuclear program.\nTrump inherited Bank Melli, one of Iran's largest state-controlled banks, as a tenant when he purchased the General Motors Building on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, according to public records reviewed by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and the Center for Public Integrity. The Trump Organization kept the bank on as a tenant for four more years after the U.S. Treasury Department designated Bank Melli in 1999 as being controlled by the Iranian government.\nU.S. officials later alleged that Bank Melli had been used to obtain sensitive materials for Iran's nuclear program. U.S. authorities also alleged that the bank had been used between 2002 and 2006 to funnel money to a unit of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard that has sponsored terrorist attacks — a period that overlapped with the time the bank rented office space from Trump.\nThe Trump Organization's dealings with the Iranian bank shed more light on Trump's wide-ranging business interests, which sometimes stand at odds with his blunt declarations on the campaign trail. Trump has denounced Iran as a \"big enemy,\" blasted Hillary Clinton for not taking a harder line against the Iranian regime and charged that donations from foreign governments to the Clinton Foundation amounted to evidence of corruption. His five-year stint as Bank Melli's landlord provides an example of the Trump Organization itself doing business with a government hostile to the United States.\n\"It's a pretty hypocritical position to take,\" said Richard Nephew, who served from 2013 to 2015 as principal deputy coordinator of sanctions policy at the U.S. State Department and spent nearly a decade working on Iran sanctions in the administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama. \"It suggests that his principles are pretty flexible when it comes to him getting paid.\"\nA court document obtained by ICIJ indicates that Bank Melli's rent on more than 8,000 square feet on the GM Building's 44th floor may have topped half a million dollars a year.\nThe legal ramifications of the Trump Organization taking rent payments from Bank Melli are unclear.\nAt the time, the U.S. had a sweeping embargo in place which prohibited Americans from doing business with Iran, including receiving rent payments. However, some Iranian organizations were granted licenses exempting specific transactions from sanctions. If the payments were licensed, it may have been legally difficult for the Trump Organization to evict the bank.\nThe Treasury Department does not publicly disclose individual licenses granting companies exemptions from sanctions rules. The Treasury Department, the Trump campaign and Bank Melli all declined to answer whether the agency had issued a license to the Trump Organization or the bank permitting rent payments during Trump's ownership of the building.\nThe Trump campaign declined to answer any questions about Bank Melli for this story, but said Trump would take steps to avoid any conflicts of interest with his business dealings if he is elected president.\n\"Mr. Trump's sole focus is and will be on making our country great again,\" campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in an email. \"He has already committed to putting his assets in a blind trust and will have no involvement whatsoever in the Trump Organization.\"\nBank Melli did not respond to repeated telephone and email inquiries by ICIJ to its offices in Tehran, London and Paris.\nBank Melli's office in the GM Building was listed by the Treasury Department among financial institutions \"owned or controlled\" by the Iranian government and subject to U.S. economic sanctions, according to the Code of Federal Regulations from the years 1999 through 2003. Trump owned the GM Building from July 1998 until September 2003, New York City property records show.\nUnder U.S. sanctions rules, Bank Melli was forbidden from conducting banking transactions within the U.S., but the bank may have maintained its New York offices in the hope that the U.S. government would someday ease sanctions against Iranian businesses.\nThe bank moved out of the GM Building sometime after 2003. A spokesperson for Boston Properties, Inc., which is currently the building's majority owner, said Bank Melli was not a tenant when Boston Properties and other partners bought the building in 2008.\nBank's ties to terrorU.S. sanctions against Iran date back to the Iranian Revolution in 1979, when Islamic fundamentalists seized power and held more than 50 Americans hostage for more than a year. After briefly lifting restrictions when the hostages were released, President Ronald Reagan designated Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism and imposed new sanctions in 1984 and 1987.\nAt the time, Donald Trump called for the U.S. take a tougher line against the Iranian regime.\nIn 1987, he suggested in a speech in New Hampshire that the U.S. should attack Iran and seize some of its oil fields to hit back for what he described as Iran's bullying of America.\n\"I'd be harsh on Iran. They've been beating us psychologically, making us look a bunch of fools,\" Trump told The Guardian in 1988. \"It'd be good for the world to take them on.\"\nIn the years that followed, Iran stepped up its support for international terrorist attacks, according to authorities in the U.S. and other Western nations.\nIn 1994, a suicide bomber killed 85 people at a Jewish center in Buenos Aires, an attack that Argentine prosecutors later charged was coordinated by the Iranian government.\nIn 1996, a truck bomb killed 19 American servicemen at the Khobar Towers apartment complex in Saudi Arabia. A U.S. court later held that the bombing had been \"planned, funded, and sponsored by senior leadership in the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\"\nAs Iran supported terror attacks abroad, the U.S. moved to punish the regime economically. President Bill Clinton approved a sweeping embargo in 1995 that banned Americans from conducting trade with Iranian businesses.\nBank Melli, one of Iran's largest state-owned banks, had long had an office in the GM Building in midtown Manhattan. In 1998, Trump's real estate organization bought the building and inherited Bank Melli as a tenant.\nIt is not clear if Trump knew personally that Bank Melli was renting an office from his company, but he was the Trump Organization's  chairman and president, and has described himself as a hands-on manager who pays attention to details.\nNephew, who worked on sanctions and nuclear nonproliferation issues for the U.S. government from 2003 to 2015, said there was less awareness in the 1990s about Iran's nuclear program and the role of banks in financing terrorism. But he said that accepting payments from Bank Melli should have raised a red flag, even in 1998.\n\"Should someone in America have known better than to do business with Iran? Yeah,\" Nephew said.\nGeorge Ross, the longtime executive vice-president of the Trump Organization, said he was not aware that Bank Melli had been a Trump tenant.\n\"We had any number of tenants in the GM Building,\" Ross said in a brief telephone interview. \"They might have been in there, but I have no knowledge of them.\"\nEmanuele Ottolenghi, an expert on Iran at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, said that it was \"remarkable\" that the Trump Organization had kept Bank Melli as a tenant for four years after the Treasury Department had listed the bank as an Iran-controlled entity.\n\"I just don't think that a company of that size and means should be able to hide behind a 'we didn't know' kind of argument,\" Ottolenghi said.\nIn 2007, U.S. authorities charged that Bank Melli had facilitated purchases for Iran's nuclear program, and that it had been used to send at least $100 million to the Quds Force, the feared special operations unit of Iran's Revolutionary Guards.\nThe Quds Force was designated as a supporter of terrorism by President George W. Bush weeks after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, for providing support to the Taliban, Hamas and Hezbollah, groups that the U.S. has labeled as terrorist organizations.\nBank Melli played an important role in Iran's nuclear program and support for international terrorism in the years before it was singled out by Treasury in 2007, experts told ICIJ.\n\"It was allowing the entities that were shopping for the regime to make payments,\" said Ottolenghi, who described Bank Melli as \"critical\" to Iran's past nuclear and terrorist activities.\nA representative for Glodow Nead Communications, a public relations firm representing the Trump Organization, told an ICIJ reporter that the Trump Organization would only comment if the story was positive. She declined as a matter of policy to provide contact information for any of its employees.\nThe Trump Organization continued renting office space to Bank Melli until the insurance company Conseco, which had provided financing for the 1998 purchase, took control of the GM Building in 2003 and sold it to the Macklowe Organization, a New York City real estate developer.\nTrump talks IranAs a presidential candidate, Trump has been a fierce critic of Iran, denouncing its government as \"the world's top state sponsor of terrorism.\" He has vowed to take a more warlike posture against the regime, threatening on Sept. 9 to shoot Iranian ships out the water if their sailors made rude gestures toward U.S. Navy ships.\nLast week, during the first of three face-to-face debates with Clinton, Trump panned the United States' 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, calling it  \"one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history.\"\nIn June, a statement by the Trump campaign blasted Clinton for her work in support of the Iran nuclear deal after the airline Iran Air struck an agreement to purchase aircraft from Boeing, a company that has contributed to the Clinton Foundation.\n\"This is another example of Clinton's pay-to-play governing style,\" the Trump campaign said. \"She will cut deals with our foreign adversaries as long as they are willing to line her pockets.\"\nAt the same time, news reports published in the course of the presidential campaign have shown that the Trump Organization has been entangled with a number of foreign governments that are hostile to the United States.\nTrump tried to raise money for the Trump Organization from the regime of Muammar Qaddafi, the Libyan dictator who provided support for the 1988 Pan Am flight bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 189 Americans,Buzzfeed News reported in June.\nA company owned by Trump violated the embargo against Cuba with a business trip to the island in 1998, shortly before he gave a speech in Miami expressing his support for the embargo, Newsweek reported in September. In addition, Bloomberg News has reported that Trump Organization executives may have also violated the Cuban embargo by scouting out a possible investment in a golf course near Havana in late 2012 or early 2013. The deal ultimately fell through, according to the report.\nThe Trump Organization has also made millions selling apartments to the government of Saudi Arabia, the New York Daily News reported in September.

The Trump Organization kept the bank on as a tenant for four more years after the U.S. Treasury Department designated Bank Melli in 1999 as being controlled by the Iranian government.\nU.S. officials later alleged that Bank Melli had been used to obtain sensitive materials for Iran's nuclear program. U.S. authorities also alleged that the bank had been used between 2002 and 2006 to funnel money to a unit of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard that has sponsored terrorist attacks — a period that overlapped with the time the bank rented office space from Trump.\nThe Trump Organization's dealings with the Iranian bank shed more light on Trump's wide-ranging business interests, which sometimes stand at odds with his blunt declarations on the campaign trail. Trump has denounced Iran as a \"big enemy,\" blasted Hillary Clinton for not taking a harder line against the Iranian regime and charged that donations from foreign governments to the Clinton Foundation amounted to evidence of corruption. His five-year stint as Bank Melli's landlord provides an example of the Trump Organization itself doing business with a government hostile to the United States.\n\"It's a pretty hypocritical position to take,\" said Richard Nephew, who served from 2013 to 2015 as principal deputy coordinator of sanctions policy at the U.S. State Department and spent nearly a decade working on Iran sanctions in the administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama. \"It suggests that his principles are pretty flexible when it comes to him getting paid.\"\nA court document obtained by ICIJ indicates that Bank Melli's rent on more than 8,000 square feet on the GM Building's 44th floor may have topped half a million dollars a year.\nThe legal ramifications of the Trump Organization taking rent payments from Bank Melli are unclear.\nAt the time, the U.S. had a sweeping embargo in place which prohibited Americans from doing business with Iran, including receiving rent payments. However, some Iranian organizations were granted licenses exempting specific transactions from sanctions. If the payments were licensed, it may have been legally difficult for the Trump Organization to evict the bank.\nThe Treasury Department does not publicly disclose individual licenses granting companies exemptions from sanctions rules. The Treasury Department, the Trump campaign and Bank Melli all declined to answer whether the agency had issued a license to the Trump Organization or the bank permitting rent payments during Trump's ownership of the building.\nThe Trump campaign declined to answer any questions about Bank Melli for this story, but said Trump would take steps to avoid any conflicts of interest with his business dealings if he is elected president.\n\"Mr. Trump's sole focus is and will be on making our country great again,\" campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in an email. \"He has already committed to putting his assets in a blind trust and will have no involvement whatsoever in the Trump Organization.\"\nBank Melli did not respond to repeated telephone and email inquiries by ICIJ to its offices in Tehran, London and Paris.\nBank Melli's office in the GM Building was listed by the Treasury Department among financial institutions \"owned or controlled\" by the Iranian government and subject to U.S. economic sanctions, according to the Code of Federal Regulations from the years 1999 through 2003. Trump owned the GM Building from July 1998 until September 2003, New York City property records show.\nUnder U.S. sanctions rules, Bank Melli was forbidden from conducting banking transactions within the U.S., but the bank may have maintained its New York offices in the hope that the U.S. government would someday ease sanctions against Iranian businesses.\nThe bank moved out of the GM Building sometime after 2003. A spokesperson for Boston Properties, Inc., which is currently the building's majority owner, said Bank Melli was not a tenant when Boston Properties and other partners bought the building in 2008.\nBank's ties to terrorU.S. sanctions against Iran date back to the Iranian Revolution in 1979, when Islamic fundamentalists seized power and held more than 50 Americans hostage for more than a year. After briefly lifting restrictions when the hostages were released, President Ronald Reagan designated Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism and imposed new sanctions in 1984 and 1987.\nAt the time, Donald Trump called for the U.S. take a tougher line against the Iranian regime.\nIn 1987, he suggested in a speech in New Hampshire that the U.S. should attack Iran and seize some of its oil fields to hit back for what he described as Iran's bullying of America.\n\"I'd be harsh on Iran. They've been beating us psychologically, making us look a bunch of fools,\" Trump told The Guardian in 1988. \"It'd be good for the world to take them on.\"\nIn the years that followed, Iran stepped up its support for international terrorist attacks, according to authorities in the U.S. and other Western nations.\nIn 1994, a suicide bomber killed 85 people at a Jewish center in Buenos Aires, an attack that Argentine prosecutors later charged was coordinated by the Iranian government.\nIn 1996, a truck bomb killed 19 American servicemen at the Khobar Towers apartment complex in Saudi Arabia. A U.S. court later held that the bombing had been \"planned, funded, and sponsored by senior leadership in the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\"\nAs Iran supported terror attacks abroad, the U.S. moved to punish the regime economically. President Bill Clinton approved a sweeping embargo in 1995 that banned Americans from conducting trade with Iranian businesses.\nBank Melli, one of Iran's largest state-owned banks, had long had an office in the GM Building in midtown Manhattan. In 1998, Trump's real estate organization bought the building and inherited Bank Melli as a tenant.\nIt is not clear if Trump knew personally that Bank Melli was renting an office from his company, but he was the Trump Organization's  chairman and president, and has described himself as a hands-on manager who pays attention to details.\nNephew, who worked on sanctions and nuclear nonproliferation issues for the U.S. government from 2003 to 2015, said there was less awareness in the 1990s about Iran's nuclear program and the role of banks in financing terrorism. But he said that accepting payments from Bank Melli should have raised a red flag, even in 1998.\n\"Should someone in America have known better than to do business with Iran? Yeah,\" Nephew said.\nGeorge Ross, the longtime executive vice-president of the Trump Organization, said he was not aware that Bank Melli had been a Trump tenant.\n\"We had any number of tenants in the GM Building,\" Ross said in a brief telephone interview. \"They might have been in there, but I have no knowledge of them.\"\nEmanuele Ottolenghi, an expert on Iran at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, said that it was \"remarkable\" that the Trump Organization had kept Bank Melli as a tenant for four years after the Treasury Department had listed the bank as an Iran-controlled entity.\n\"I just don't think that a company of that size and means should be able to hide behind a 'we didn't know' kind of argument,\" Ottolenghi said.\nIn 2007, U.S. authorities charged that Bank Melli had facilitated purchases for Iran's nuclear program, and that it had been used to send at least $100 million to the Quds Force, the feared special operations unit of Iran's Revolutionary Guards.\nThe Quds Force was designated as a supporter of terrorism by President George W. Bush weeks after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, for providing support to the Taliban, Hamas and Hezbollah, groups that the U.S. has labeled as terrorist organizations.\nBank Melli played an important role in Iran's nuclear program and support for international terrorism in the years before it was singled out by Treasury in 2007, experts told ICIJ.\n\"It was allowing the entities that were shopping for the regime to make payments,\" said Ottolenghi, who described Bank Melli as \"critical\" to Iran's past nuclear and terrorist activities.\nA representative for Glodow Nead Communications, a public relations firm representing the Trump Organization, told an ICIJ reporter that the Trump Organization would only comment if the story was positive. She declined as a matter of policy to provide contact information for any of its employees.\nThe Trump Organization continued renting office space to Bank Melli until the insurance company Conseco, which had provided financing for the 1998 purchase, took control of the GM Building in 2003 and sold it to the Macklowe Organization, a New York City real estate developer.\nTrump talks IranAs a presidential candidate, Trump has been a fierce critic of Iran, denouncing its government as \"the world's top state sponsor of terrorism.\" He has vowed to take a more warlike posture against the regime, threatening on Sept. 9 to shoot Iranian ships out the water if their sailors made rude gestures toward U.S. Navy ships.\nLast week, during the first of three face-to-face debates with Clinton, Trump panned the United States' 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, calling it  \"one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history.\"\nIn June, a statement by the Trump campaign blasted Clinton for her work in support of the Iran nuclear deal after the airline Iran Air struck an agreement to purchase aircraft from Boeing, a company that has contributed to the Clinton Foundation.\n\"This is another example of Clinton's pay-to-play governing style,\" the Trump campaign said. \"She will cut deals with our foreign adversaries as long as they are willing to line her pockets.\"\nAt the same time, news reports published in the course of the presidential campaign have shown that the Trump Organization has been entangled with a number of foreign governments that are hostile to the United States.\nTrump tried to raise money for the Trump Organization from the regime of Muammar Qaddafi, the Libyan dictator who provided support for the 1988 Pan Am flight bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 189 Americans,Buzzfeed News reported in June.\nA company owned by Trump violated the embargo against Cuba with a business trip to the island in 1998, shortly before he gave a speech in Miami expressing his support for the embargo, Newsweek reported in September. In addition, Bloomberg News has reported that Trump Organization executives may have also violated the Cuban embargo by scouting out a possible investment in a golf course near Havana in late 2012 or early 2013. The deal ultimately fell through, according to the report.\nThe Trump Organization has also made millions selling apartments to the government of Saudi Arabia, the New York Daily News reported in September. The Saudi government is formally a U.S. ally but is suspected of supporting militant Islamic groups, and Trump has called on the Clinton Foundation to return Saudi donations because of the government's poor human rights record.\nOther Trump Organization entanglements in India, Russia and Dubai create conflicts of interest that could threaten American national security if Trump become president, Newsweek reported in September.\nInformation on all of these ventures is limited because Trump has not released his tax returns.

Brady Press Briefing Room\n**Please see below for a correction, marked with an asterisk.\n1:13 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. It's nice to see you all. As you can see, I'm joined by some special guests today. Earlier this year, the President traveled to South by Southwest, where he challenged tech leaders, creators and entrepreneurs to leverage the latest technology, the most innovative approaches to solve some of our country's toughest challenges. And today, he's bringing that call to action to the White House, to the South Lawn, to be precise, in the first ever South by South Lawn festival. It celebrates the work of everyday Americans who are using cutting-edge technology, art, film and innovative thinking to shape a better future for Americans and across the globe.\nI will briefly introduce the leaders who are standing next to me. I'll give them an opportunity to each speak briefly, and then we'll open it up to questions you may have for them.\nSo, standing immediately to my right is Carmen Rojas. Carmen is the CEO of the Workers Lab, an innovation lad that invests in entrepreneurs, community organizers and technologists to develop new ways to build power for working people in the United States. And to her right is Jukay Hsu. Jukay is a Bronze Star veteran of the Iraq war. He is also the founder of Coalition for Queens, which creates pathways out of poverty through technology in the world's most diverse community. And to his right is Anil Dash. Anil is an entrepreneur, activist and writer who advocates for more humane, inclusive and ethical technology industry. Anil cofounded Makerbase, an online community for people who make apps and websites.\nSo like I said, we'll give each of them an opportunity to offer some brief comments about what they're hoping to do at the White House today, and then we'll give you a chance to ask your questions.\nSo, Carmen, do you want to go first?\nMS. ROJAS: Good afternoon, everyone. I am really excited to be here. This is a real honor for us at the Workers Lab to be able to share some of the most cutting-edge technologies, enterprises and organizations that are transforming conditions for working people in the U.S. And in particularly, we're excited to announce the launch of a digital platform called Together We Work, which is focused on offering young people who work a set of digital tools that they can use to organize and amplify their voice and to tell their stories and connect with each other.\nThank you for having me.\nMR. HSU: Hello, everyone. It's honor really for me to be here and represent my organization, C4Q. We clear pathways away from poverty through technology training in Queens, which is the world's most diverse community -- it's the most diverse county in America. For us, as the technology sector continues to change all industries and reshapes our economy, we hope that everyone has the opportunity to not only learn to code but get an amazing job in technology, and help creating these companies in innovations of the future.\nOur program -- we're really fortunate -- focused on the 65 percent of New Yorkers that don't go to college. I think most Americans don't go to college, and if you never go to college, your average lifetime income in New York is $27,000 a year. For us going through the program, we raise people's average income from $18,000 starting out to $85,000 a year after the program, and at the same time, represents the diversity of Queens, which is half women, 60 percent black or Hispanic, half immigrants. So we really feel that if we can do it there and help support the growth in New York's technology community we hope communities all across America can also have access to these opportunities and help grow our economy.\nThank you for having me.\nMR. DASH: Good afternoon. Working in the tech industry the last 10 or 15 years, I've gotten to watch events like South by Southwest, where people in tech talk about how they want to change the world, the impact they want to have. And it's really exciting to see the dots sort of get connected from that intent to South by South Lawn today, where we're going to have this series of conversations with people doing the actual work of impact in their communities around areas like workers' rights, as Carmen said, some of the other folks who are changing around civil rights, and sort of taking that promise of what we thought technology was going to do for the world and connecting it into the arts and film and music, and some other disciplines, and also see the real impact we have in helping our communities, our neighborhoods, our cities and the whole country.\nMR. EARNEST: Any questions?\nThank you all for coming and making the presentation.\nOkay. Sometimes it's harder to get out of here than it is to get in. (Laughter.) Hopefully we're not going to be testing that proposition with me today. (Laughter.) But we'll see. Obviously, we're really excited about all of the activities associated with the South by South Lawn. And those of you who are interested, we'll have varying opportunities to cover today and it also will be livestreamed. So, fortunately, the weather cooperated, and it should be a really terrific event.\nSo, Nancy, I'm happy to talk to you about that or anything else that may be on your mind today.\nQ: I wonder if you can tell us what the President's reaction was to the reports about Donald Trump's taxes, what it says about Donald Trump, or what it says about the tax code.\nMR. EARNEST: I've not spoken to the President about this story. What I can tell you is that you've heard the President on a number of occasions since his very first year in office talk about the need to ensure that we have a tax code that is consistent with a smart economic strategy, but also a tax code that's fair.\nAnd the President has worked hard -- one of his most prominent campaign promises in 2008 was to make the tax code more fair while at the same time protecting tax cuts that middle class families benefit from. And in the context of the Recovery Act that was passed within the first couple of months of the President taking office, there were significant tax cuts included for small businesses, other tax cuts that were targeted at middle-class families and, after the President's reelection in 2012, you'll recall that the President was able to finally reach a breakthrough agreement with Republicans in Congress to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans. This is the first time the Republicans in the Congress had voted to raise taxes in a couple of decades.\nSo the President has made fairness in our tax code a top priority, again, because the President believes in the principle of fairness, but also because he believes it's the smartest way for us to pursue sustainable economic growth in the United States. And the President is hopeful that he will be succeeded in office by a President who is committed to not just pursuing but even furthering that strategy.\nQ: Do you think that Donald Trump's report on his taxes is emblematic of what's wrong with the tax code? Does it offer you an example to make that case?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think it's difficult for anybody to draw a firm conclusion about that without having an opportunity to look at all of the data. And I recognize that's a subject of some dispute on the campaign trail.\nWhat I will say is, Mr. Trump's tax strategies aside, the President believes that we could do some very helpful things for the economy by closing loopholes that only benefit the wealthy and well-connected, and using the revenue from those closed loopholes to invest in things like infrastructure; invest in community college for every hardworking American student. These are the kinds of things that we know would be good for our economy both in the short term, but also would lay a strong foundation for our long-term economic growth.\nSo that's the strategy that the President has pursued. And, frankly, he did that before we knew all that much about the tax strategies that were designed by the Republican nominee and his accountants.\nQ: Also, what is the White House reaction to Russia's decision to suspend the deal on disposing of weapons-grade plutonium?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I've seen those reports as of this morning. This is an announcement that we were disappointed by. The decision by the Russians to unilaterally withdraw from this commitment is disappointing, and the reason for that is that this agreement that went into force in 2011 pledged the disposal of thousands of nuclear weapons' worth of plutonium. And this was an agreement that was reached by the United States and Russia because we're the two countries that have the largest amount of this material and both leaders in Russia and the United States have made nonproliferation a priority. And certainly the United States is interested in limiting proliferation and trying to reduce the risk associated with potential nuclear terrorism.\nAnd again, we know that Russia's leadership has recognized this risk. The United States has been steadfast since 2011 in implementing our side of the bargain, and we would like to see the Russians continue to do the same thing.\nQ: Do you think it's -- that the Syria issue would spill over into this?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think -- obviously these are two different situations, and we've made clear that our relationship with the Russians is quite complex. There are areas where the United States and Russia have been able to work effectively to advance our shared interests. Our success in completing a diplomatic arrangement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, for example, would not have been possible without the constructive role that Russia played throughout those negotiations. I think that's an indication of the priority that Russia has placed on nonproliferation. They understand the national security consequences of this.\nThe United States and Russia have been able to coordinate our efforts in terms of trying to isolate the North Koreans for their destabilizing activities on the Korean Peninsula. That obviously is a positive development and certainly strengthens our hand as we deal with a very difficult situation there.\nAnd we've obviously talked quite a bit about how the United States and Russia were able to work together to dispose of Bashar al-Assad's declared chemical weapons stockpile in Syria -- again, an agreement that would not have been possible without the ability of the United States and Russia to work effectively together.\nWe've obviously been quite disappointed about a range of Russian decisions however, both inside of Syria but also in Ukraine. And, unfortunately, the announcement about the Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement is more in line with those kinds of decisions that have only deepened Russia's isolation in the international community. But the plutonium arrangement is one that does reflect the shared priorities of our two countries, and we are hopeful that the Russians will recognize that and follow through on the commitments that they have made.\nQ: Josh, what is the United States' next step or move after the Colombians decided over the weekend to reject the peace deal? The President was obviously very involved in this. What's your next move?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Jeff, obviously the President had an opportunity to visit with President Santos in New York, and the expectation was that the peace agreement would be ratified by Colombian voters, and that's not what occurred. Colombia is a democracy. It's a sovereign country. And the leaders of Colombia had made a commitment to give the voters the opportunity to weigh in on that agreement. And the margin was quite narrow, but it's important for the decisions that are made by the Colombian government to reflect the will of the Colombian people. And that's precisely what President Santos has indicated.\nNow, the good news is that all of the parties -- even the FARC leaders and even the opposition leader, Mr. Uribe -- have indicated a commitment to achieve peace and to do so in an inclusive manner. So I know that President Santos and his team is focused on figuring out what they can do at the negotiating table to move this forward. And we're hopeful that they'll be able to settle on a path that leads to the kind of negotiated settlement and negotiated peace that all of the parties have indicated they would like to see.\nThe United States, thus far, has played a constructive role in trying to facilitate that kind of an agreement and the United States stands ready, even through our Special Envoy, to try to support all sides as they reach an agreement that is consistent with the will and ambition of the Colombian people.\nQ: So you intend to sort of play a similar role that the U.S. has before? Can you be any more specific about that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the process from here is going to be dictated by President Santos and the Colombian government, and obviously that will also be determined by their negotiations with the FARC about how to move forward. We hope that all sides will continue to be focused on the goal of a negotiated peace and we want to encourage them to continue to pursue that path. But it's also important for them to be acting consistent with the promises that they've made to the Colombian people, and to be acting consistent with the will of the Colombian people.\nSo the President has made the observation on a number of occasions that democracy can be messy at times. This might be the latest example of that. The good news is that all sides, including the voters, I think are still focused on trying to reach this negotiated peace. And that certainly is within the national security interest of the United States to end this war. And we're going to encourage all sides to pursue that peace.\nQ: Moving to the Philippines. Is there a concern within the White House that the increasing hostility from President Duterte will erode the military and political alliance between the United States and the Philippines?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Jeff, the United States is strongly committed to the alliance that we have with the Philippines. And the President was able to personally attest to his commitment to that alliance when he traveled to the Philippines a year or so ago and met with President Duterte's predecessor to discuss strengthening and deepening that alliance.\nYou'll recall the President -- I think you may have even been there -- the President did an event at a pier in Manila, where there was a Navy -- or Coast Guard vessel that had been transferred to the Filipino government for use in their maritime security operations. This is a U.S. Coast Guard vessel that had been transferred to the Filipinos to enhance their maritime security. And I think that's an indication of the kind of military and security cooperation that President Obama is committed to and that our country is committed to.\nThis is also one of the reasons that President Obama had committed and intended to meet with President Duterte when he was in -- when both leaders were in Laos a month or so ago. That meeting didn't come about because it was pretty clear from the lead-up to that meeting that it was unlikely to be particularly constructive. But the President is committed to the kind of relationship that the Filipino people certainly acknowledge has benefitted their country and their national security.\nThere are a variety of ways in which the United States and the United States military has benefitted the Filipino people, both in terms of adding resources to their maritime security efforts; there are U.S. forces that work closely with counterterrorism and security forces in the Philippines to address an extremist threat in that country that they're countering. The United States military was also instrumental in helping to mobilize a response to a deadly typhoon in the Pacific Ocean in the last couple years -- a response that certainly was instrumental to meeting the needs of thousands of Filipinos who had been negatively affected by this devastating storm.\nSo that's the kind of relationship I think that you would expect between two treaty allies. And it's the kind of relationship that has the United States being held in quite high regard by the Filipino people. And President Obama and the other members of his administration are committed to continuing to strengthen that alliance.\nQ: But the examples that you're citing precede the hostility that I was referencing by President Duterte. So to what extent does that affect those goals? And do you take seriously his threat to end the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement? And are you concerned about the growing influence of China as a result of the hostility that I mentioned?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as it relates to the defense agreement, it's, of course, a binding one, and there's a formal process for withdrawing from it or changing it, and I'm not aware that that process has commenced in anyway.\nWith regard to the efforts of the Philippine government to form relationships with other countries in the region, obviously there are a variety of other examples of other allies of the United States seeking to strengthen their relationship with other countries in the region, including China. So I've been asked this question both in the context of President Park of South Korea and Prime Minister Abe of Japan when they've had conversations with President Xi or other senior Chinese officials, and what we've said at every turn is that the United States believes it's in our interest for our closest friends in the Asia Pacific to have an effective working relationship with the Chinese.\nAnd sometimes it's difficult to determine precisely what President Duterte's intent is in offering public comments, but if his intent is to seek a more effective relationship with China, that doesn't undermine U.S. positioning in that region of the world. And that's certainly been true with regard to our relationship with South Korea and Japan, who obviously have their own diplomatic relationship with China, as well.\nMichelle.\nQ: When you were asked about Donald Trump and the documents that came out over the last couple of days, you mentioned a fair tax code and you mentioned loopholes. So are you saying that what happened here, the claiming of a nearly billion-dollar loss that could have led to not paying taxes for years, is that unfair and is that a loophole?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I'll let others opine on the political ramifications here. And with regard to the specific details of his tax arrangements, I think it's a little hard to draw that kind of conclusion without seeing the tax returns themselves. And thus far, he's not released them. So I'll let people with a little more expertise weigh in on his individual situation and what it says about his approach to doing business.\nThe President's priorities appear to be different, but are deeply held. And these priorities for a more fair tax code -- a tax code that advantages the middle class, a tax code that closes loopholes that only benefit the wealthy and well-connected -- those are policies that President Obama campaigned on in 2008 and that he's been pursuing since his very first year in office.\nAnd our success in making progress in making our tax code more fair is at least part of what we would attribute our strengthening economy and our falling deficit to. There are a variety of contributing factors, of course, but there is no denying that making tax cuts permanent for middle-class families, and expanding tax cuts that benefit middle-class families in the form of the child tax credit or the American Opportunity Tax Credit, which allows people to get a credit on college tuition, are things that are good for the U.S. economy and they certainly do make the U.S. economy more fair and make the tax code more fair.\nSo that's been our approach, and it's one that the President has prioritized.\nQ: And speaking of the FARC vote, several times just in the past year we've seen a popular vote go deeply against U.S. goals or projected outcomes, or what the U.S. would have liked to have seen happen. And we've also heard the President several times say that he doesn't think that the American people will elect Donald Trump. When you see around the world these popular votes going in a direction that may not have been expected, does that cause him to rethink what he's been saying about the upcoming U.S. election?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess the first thing that I would say is I have a lot more confidence in the kind of rigorous analysis that's been done of the U.S. presidential election than obviously I would of the Colombian political system. That seems like a more difficult system to analyze.\nQ: But there's also Brexit.\nMR. EARNEST: True. But I think we knew all along that that was going to be close.\nLook, I think the President has also gone to great lengths to make it clear that it's important for the American people not to be complacent. And I think it will be evidenced in the five weeks or so that remain in this race that President Obama intends to make a very vigorous case in support of Secretary Clinton because of his deeply held feelings about the race and about who he would like to see succeed him. And I think that is consistent with somebody who has not taken the outcome for granted, but rather is somebody who is determined to not let people be complacent, in part because they may think they know what the outcome is going to be.\nQ: So as we see him out on the trail, including this week, is he going to change the message? Is it going to be much the same as what we've heard before?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have remarks to preview. Obviously, the President will have an opportunity to speak on Wednesday night in south Florida. I'm not aware that the President is intending to change his strategy, but I think those of you who have been following the President's public comments over the last several weeks have noticed that the President has tailored his remarks both to the audience that he's directly addressing, but also to the news environment in which he is delivering the remarks. And I would anticipate he'll do a similar thing on Wednesday.\nQ: Okay. And lastly on -- just in the last couple of days we heard a piece of audio from Secretary Kerry talking to some Syrian activists, and saying that he lost the argument with the administration for using military force in Syria. Is that an argument that he continues to make?\nMR. EARNEST: My understanding is that he delivered that -- he made that declaration in the context of discussing the appropriate response on the part of the United States to the Assad regime's use of chemical weapons. You'll recall the President made exactly the same argument; the President made an argument to Congress that they should authorize the use of military force. That is an argument that did not prevail.\nBut the President has also made the case that the outcome has been a good one; that the outcome of that situation is that the Assad regime did declare that they had chemical weapons -- something that they did for the first time. The United States was able to work effectively with the Russians to round up that declared chemical weapons stockpile, collect it, and destroy it successfully. And that did reflect the ability of the United States and Russia to work together to get that done. That didn't just prevent the Assad regime from being able to use those chemical weapons against innocent civilians. It also prevented those chemical weapons from falling into the hands of terrorists that have essentially overrun that country.\nSo the proliferation risk that was eliminated by destroying those chemical weapons is significant. And that is the good outcome that I was referring to. Obviously, the situation in Syria continues to be quite troubling. And the willingness of the Assad regime, for example, to weaponize chlorine, an otherwise -- a compound that has many industrial uses -- but using that as a weapon I think is an indication of the depravity of the regime, and it is an indication of the violence that was avoided by taking the declared chemical weapons stockpile out of his hands.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, since you've come out here, the State Department has announced we have actually suspended diplomatic consultations with Russia over Syria. Is President Obama's patience with Vladimir Putin on Syria officially at an end?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Mark, I think everybody's patience with Russia has run out. They've also spent a great deal of credibility in making a series of commitments without any clear indication that they were committed to following them.\nSo what we have seen from the Russians in the year or so since their military intervention in Syria is that they have not made much progress against ISIL. They claim that the reason that they're in Syria is to fight extremists, but they haven't made a significant -- they haven't achieved a significant counter-ISIL objective in more than seven months, and they've been reduced to trying to claim credit for successful U.S. operations.\nI'm referring, of course, to the U.S. strike that took al-Adnani off the battlefield. He was a senior ISIL external plotter, and Russia was in the position where they were rather pathetically trying to claim credit for having carried out that operation. I think that's an indication that they don't have too much to claim credit for when it comes to fighting extremists and fighting ISIL.\nYou'll recall that when Russia announced this military intervention in Syria about a year or so ago, they did so with the intent to \"unite a broad range of forces.\" Well, here we are, a year later, and Russia is standing alone with Iran trying to prop up the Assad regime while the rest of the international community rebukes them for the tactics that they have used inside of Syria, and while the rest of the international community works with the United States as a part of our coalition to go after ISIL and other extremists that are operating inside of Syria.\nThere's also not a whole lot that Russia, at this point, has to show for their efforts on the ground -- that, essentially, they're in a stalemate and, again, they've been reduced to either acting unilaterally or supporting the Iranians in dropping bunker-busting bombs on civilian hospitals in Aleppo. It's outrageous, and it's drawn international condemnation not just from the United States but from countries around the world. And that's not an indication of a military force that's enjoying a lot of progress on the ground, but it is part of a concerted strategy that we've seen from the Russians and the Syrians to try to bomb civilian populations into submission. And they've enjoyed some limited gains as a result and it appears they're trying to get more that way, but after a year of doing it, they don't have a lot to show for their efforts.\nFinally, I'll just say that much has been written about the theatrics employed by President Putin to try to raise his own personal profile and try to raise the profile of his country on the international stage. So you recall, those of you who traveled to New York with the President in 2015, just over a year ago, President Putin delivered a much-hyped speech to the U.N. General Assembly. He was talking about the commitment of Russia to do some of the things that I outlined before. A year later, President Putin didn't even show up at the United Nations General Assembly, in part because I think he rightly assumed that the rest of the international community was prepared to rebuke and condemn the actions that he has overseen in that country. And it was while the world was gathered in New York at the United Nations General Assembly that it became clear that Russia was complicit in an attack against a U.N. humanitarian convoy.\nSo the goals that Russia has laid out in advance of the military intervention have not been achieved. And the last thing I'd say about the ongoing -- or what had been ongoing talks between the U.S. and Russia on Syria is that from the beginning, President Obama was insistent that the United States would not be in a position to provide Russia what they wanted -- which is military cooperation -- until Russia had demonstrated their commitment to living up to the terms of the agreement. Russia never did that, unfortunately.\nBut there have been concerns raised in the past that somehow Russia was just using the cover of negotiations to try to extract concessions from the United States or our coalition partners, or to cover their efforts on the ground. But in this case, that's just not true, because the United States didn't make any concessions at the beginning of the negotiations. And I think the world has been quite cognizant and quite clear and quite critical of what Russia has been doing over the last several weeks.\nQ: By cutting off talks this way, do you think that's really going to affect Russia's behavior in Syria? Or doesn't this really just condemn the poor Syrians to being bombed until it's all over and the Russians and their Syrian allies win?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Mark, what's clear is that there is nothing more for the United States and Russia to talk about with regard to trying to reach an agreement that would reduce the violence inside of Syria. And that's tragic. And you're right, that would likely lead -- that ongoing Russian violence, aiding and abetting Assad regime forces, means that there are likely more Syrian people who are going to get killed -- innocent Syrian civilians. And what's happening in Syria is tragic, and it is deeply concerning, and it is something that the Russians have been complicit in for a year now.\nAndrew.\nQ: I guess the question is what now? Is there a solution -- and are you considering other options?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Andrew, the President and his national security team are always pursuing a range of contingency plans. And you will recall that when we first began discussing this, even in the context of this room, that we were quite skeptical that Russia would live up to the commitments that they had made. So the President and his team -- as the President, I think has acknowledged on a number of occasions, this is something that the President spends a lot of time thinking about, and there are regular meetings among the members of his team to develop options to present to him. And that work is going to continue. I don't have any additional announcements at this point about the path that we'll pursue, but the international community continues to be deeply concerned about the situation in Syria.\nQ: Another issue. This morning, Donald Trump -- I'll ask you another question about Donald Trump.\nMR. EARNEST: Only five weeks to go.\nQ: -- that veterans who have PTSD -- post-traumatic stress -- are somehow weak and those who don't get it are strong. I wonder if you have any reaction?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President actually answered this quite directly in the town hall that he did with Michelle's colleague at CNN down at Fort Lee last week. And the Commander-in-Chief made a firm declaration that it is not a sign of weakness to get help. In fact, it's a sign of character and a sign of strength to ensure that you're taking care of yourself.\nAnd the President has acknowledged the cultural barriers in the military to changing attitudes about this. We've made some progress on this, and that's a testament not just to the efforts of the President but that's also a testament to the efforts of the uniform leadership of the United States military that's acknowledged that this is a cultural norm that should change.\nPresident Obama has also ramped up resources at the VA and at the Department of Defense that can be used to treat veterans and servicemembers who have sustained unseen wounds in combat. And the President also acknowledged the heroism that we've seen from our men and women in uniform who have served this country with extraordinary courage and, in some cases, unimaginably difficult situations, that have gotten help in treating both their physical and their mental wounds and are the picture of resilience. And that resilience is something that inspires a lot of pride in just about every American. It certainly does in the minds of every American that serves in the White House, I'll tell you that.\nQ: You mentioned that the role of the United States is going to be constructive with the Colombian peace process. Could you explain a little bit more in which ways the U.S. is going to help? And also, regarding to the $400 million that the President compromised to the process, what is going to happen? Is the U.S. going to frozen this millions waiting for the final and certain path of this peace process?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think the path forward is one that's going to be determined by President Santos, based on his negotiations with all parties who participated in the peace process. And the goal of the United States has been to try to facilitate the kind of negotiated settlement -- negotiated peace that would bring an end to a long-running conflict, in fact the longest-running civil war in the hemisphere.\nSo Colombia is a sovereign country and the United States and Colombia, over the last decade or two, have been able to work effectively to strengthen the economy and strengthen the security situation inside of Colombia. The United States remains as committed as ever, working closely with the Colombian government and the Colombian people, in pursuit of those aims.\nBut the next steps in this process will be determined by the Colombian government, and they will do so with the strong support of the U.S. government and the American people. Special Envoy Aronson will continue to be deeply engaged in this process as well. But we take some satisfaction, despite the electoral setback, in seeing the renewed commitment from all parties to the pursuit of peace.\nQ: And the $400 million?\nMR. EARNEST: I can't speak to any sort of economic assistance that may be in the pipeline. I'd refer you to the State Department on that. What I can tell you is that the United States remains deeply committed to the strong relationship between the United States and Colombia, both between our governments and our people. And the United States benefits from a Colombia that has a strong economy and a Colombia that has addressed some of the security situation -- some aspects of the security situation that have been troubling for the Colombian people. The United States benefits from improvements in those areas, and we're going to continue to support the Colombian government as they make a decision for the necessary steps to make those improvements.\nRon.\nQ: Is it fair to say that the United States was surprised by this outcome in Colombia?\nMR. EARNEST: Ron, I think everybody was surprised by this outcome. I think many people expected that this was an agreement that would be ratified. And much of the analysis that was done in advance predicted -- I think all of the analysis that was done in advance predicted that it would be ratified by the Colombian people. It wasn't. But, again, I guess as I made reference to with Jeff, the President has acknowledged that democracy is messy sometimes, but it's important for a government to be responsive to the will of the people.\nThe margin here was quite narrow, and I think it's an indication that there is still some work to do to meet the needs and expectations of the Colombian people. And President Santos has rightly committed to addressing those concerns that have been raised as they pursue peace.\nQ: How engaged will the United States be in trying to facilitate this process? I guess you've been asked this a couple of different ways, and I'm trying to get -- would you argue that the United States was not engaged in the process or was not trying to facilitate or affect the outcome of the vote?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the outcome of the vote is something that the United States was certainly -- the will of the Colombian people is something that should be expressed in terms of determining these kinds of outcomes. And so the United States was not trying to put a thumb on the scale. Obviously the United States made clear that we are supportive of the process and we are supportive of the negotiated settlement that had come forward, but we are also quite clear in deferring to the sovereignty of the Colombian people in making a decision that they concluded was in the best interest of their country.\nBut, look, the United States has been engaged in these efforts for a long time. Many of these efforts actually began under President Bush, President Obama's predecessor, who was interested in trying to help the Colombian government addressed this situation. Obviously President Obama had dispatched a Special Envoy to assist and facilitate in these discussions. President Obama actually met with President Santos in New York just a couple of weeks ago now, and in the context of that meeting, President Santos presented President Obama a copy of the peace agreement that had been reached. So I think that's a pretty clear indication that this was a process that included U.S. involvement and strong U.S. support.\nBut at each stage we've been quite clear that it's ultimately the responsibility of the Colombian people to exercise their own judgment about the best interests of their country.\nQ: On Syria, you continue to say that the Russians don't have a lot to show for what they've been doing there and that it's a stalemate. Is it really a stalemate? There are so many indications that Aleppo is about to become completely besieged, and obviously we know of the horrific humanitarian toll this is taking. But it looks like the Russians are accomplishing their objective of keeping Bashar al-Assad in power. Do you feel like he's threatened?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Ron, I think we should just take -- go back and look at what the Russian objectives were at the beginning of this enterprise. And again, what President Putin said was that they were focused on confronting the extremist threat inside of ISIL. And they don't have --\nQ: You never thought that was really true -- you said from the beginning that they've never shown any --\nMR. EARNEST: But again, in terms of evaluating their objectives, shouldn't we just take President Putin at his word? These are the objectives that he laid out in advance of the military intervention. So if we're going to evaluate whether or not his stated strategy was successful, let's go back to his stated strategy.\nQ: But again, based on -- do you really believe that their key objective was to go after extremists, or do you believe that their key objective was to prop up the regime?\nMR. EARNEST: I think Russia is rightly and justifiably concerned about the growing extremist threat that they face inside of Syria. They recognize that there is a risk that is posed to the presence that they have in Syria. There's also a risk that Russia faces back home in fueling extremism. So I do think that they are mindful of the extremist threat.\nYou'll recall that the whole goal of these negotiations -- or the most prized objective of the Russians in the context of these negotiations around the Cessation of Hostilities was the extract a commitment from the United States that we would cooperate with them and operate jointly in pursuit of extremist. But in more than seven -- over the last seven months, Russia doesn't have a single significant counter-ISIL objective that they can point to achieving. In fact, they've been reduced to trying to, rather lamely, claim credit for the successful operations that the United States and our coalition partners have taken to take extremists off the battlefield.\nQ: So you don't think that propping up the regime was a high priority of the Russians?\nMR. EARNEST: I didn't say that. We know that was part of their strategy, too.\nQ: Arguably, that was a huge part of their objective, no?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think, Ron, we can just sort of go back to what President Putin has said. And if you want me to go through that, I can do that again. Or we can just move on.\nQ: And just again, looking at the situation overall, I would imagine there's a reassessment of what the U.S. is going to do now. Is there a scenario that the President can foresee -- he's talked a lot lately about how much anguish -- my word -- this whole situation causes him and the limitations of what he feels America can do to address the humanitarian situation? I think there was another hospital that was bombed today --\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah, there was.\nQ: Is there something that the President sees that could -- do you think there's something that he could see that would cause him to rethink using some level of -- greater level of military engagement to try to do something there?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Ron, it's important to consider -- well, let's start by saying that the situation inside of Syria is nothing short of heartbreaking. And there are reports that one of the few remaining hospitals in eastern Aleppo was the victim of a bunker-busting bomb today. It is outrageous that a bunker-busting bomb would be used to destroy a hospital that was treating innocent people who are caught in the crossfire of this conflict. And there's no mincing words about that. It is immoral. It is unconscionable. And it is an outrage worthy of international condemnation, which Russia and Syria and Iran have all been on the receiving end of. And for good reason.\nWith regard to U.S. options, we obviously have been very focused on countering ISIL and other extremist groups that are suing the chaos in Syria as a safe haven to plot and carry out attacks against the United States or our allies throughout the West. We're very mindful of that. And that's why you've seen the United States be quite aggressive in taking action against extremists.\nMy colleagues at the Department of Defense can tell you that there was an operation that was undertaken today to target this al Qaeda leader in Syria, al Masri. He is one of the leading -- one of the most senior leaders of that organization. And the United States Department of Defense took a strike against him just today. That's an indication of how focused the United States military is on taking action against figures who pose a risk to the United States. That is, of course, our number-one priority.\nQ: And it's still seen that the regime is not a threat to U.S. national security, therefore the objective is not to go after the regime?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what is true is that the political failure of the regime to effectively govern that country has created a chaotic situation that only benefits extremists and incites violence that fuels extremism.\nSo we're deeply concerned about the political situation in Syria, both because of the humanitarian situation that we were discussing before, but also because of the instability that this adds to an already volatile region of the world, and we know that extremists seek to capitalize on that instability to threaten the United States.\nSo we have acknowledged all along that while there is great military might that is being used inside of Syria to take out extremists and protect the American people, that ultimately the solution that we need inside of Syria is a diplomatic one -- is a political one that results in a change in leadership in Syria. And the path to that kind of political transition is hard to see right now.\nQ: And given all the daily carnage and horrific things that have happened there -- hospitals destroyed; you describe it very graphically -- the President does not yet see a reason for humanitarian intervention in the situation right now?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the United States has offered significant humanitarian assistance -- $5.6 billion in humanitarian assistance to the situation in Syria and to countries in the region that are housing refugees.\nQ: A military response based on a humanitarian mission.\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, I'm not going to get ahead of what sort of discussions the President and his national security team are having. But the President has been quite clear about what our goals in Syria are now, and the President has also explained the lessons that we need to have learned from the situation in Iraq, 10 or 12 years ago, which is that a full-scale, prolonged ground combat operation, mobilized by U.S. troops, is not in our interest, either in the short term or in the long term. And the President's conclusion about that tactic has not changed, but the President is going to continue to be in conversations with members of his team. What I also anticipate is that there will be some aspects of this contingency planning that we'll be able to talk about publicly and some aspects of it that we won't be able to talk about publicly. But that's the nature of the situation in Syria.\nThe one other thing that I would point out with all of this -- it sort of goes back to your initial line of questioning -- is it's not just the United States that's insisting on a political transition inside of Syria. President Putin has acknowledged the same thing. He has acknowledged that the failed political leadership inside of Syria has fomented this chaos and made the situation more dangerous for everybody, including Russia. And so President Putin himself has acknowledged that a political transition inside of Syria is necessary.\nMaria.\nQ: Yes, thank you, Josh. So I'm wondering if the President saw the Supreme Court's decision today to a re-hearing of the immigration case. And is that a blow to his goals and his legacy with the immigrant community? What is his reaction to that? And also, a follow-up question on Colombia. Just to be clear, you've said that the U.S. is committed to continuing to support President Santos and the peace process. So is Paz Colombia on or off the table?\nMR. EARNEST: With regard to the immigration ruling from the Supreme Court today, the United States is -- the administration, I should say, is disappointed that the Supreme Court has once again denied the Department of Justice's petition to rehear this case. There's no practical impact in terms of the implementation of this policy. And that, of course, is a double-edged sword. The enforcement priorities that the administration has laid out in terms of focusing our efforts on felons and not families will move forward. It has moved forward in a way that we believe has enhanced the safety and security of communities all across the country.\nWe're focusing our enforcement efforts on recent border-crossers, on those who pose a threat to our national security, and on those that are -- and on criminals. And that has proved to be an effective way for the United States government to use our limited enforcement resources to protect the American people. And this disappointing decision from the Supreme Court does not affect those enforcement priorities.\nHowever, there are other aspects of the President's executive actions that the Supreme Court was unable to hear. And earlier this year, the Supreme Court did announce that they were unable to reach a verdict in evaluating the constitutionality of the President's executive actions. And I think it underscores once again the need for the Republicans in Congress to do their job. Republicans in the Senate need to confirm a 9th justice to the Supreme Court so that the business of the American people can be conducted at the Supreme Court. The inability of the Supreme Court in this situation to reach a decision and put forward a ruling has a negative impact on millions of people in the United States. The American people deserve better from their representation in the United States Senate.\nPresident Reagan, back in 1987, made a similar observation -- that the best interests of the American people are not served if there's a prolonged vacancy on the Supreme Court. He was right. President Obama has made the same observation, and it's hard to think of a better example than the Supreme Court being unable to reach a decision on a set of immigration reform proposals that would have a positive impact on the United States and our economy and on our national security.\nWith regard to Colombia, the United States remains committed to the process that we have laid out before, including a commitment to continuing to support the Colombian people and the Colombian government through the Peace Colombia initiative. And that process will move forward even as we continue to support the Colombian government in pursuit of a negotiated peace.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, can you tell us a little bit more about when President Obama made the decision, and what prompted him to make the decision that Russia -- the calculation that Russia was unable or unwilling to broker this ceasefire?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Margaret, as you know, Secretary Kerry was the individual that was tasked with trying to broker some kind of diplomatic agreement with the Russians around a Cessation of Hostilities. He was tenacious and dogged in those efforts. And the President was relying on his advice in determining when it was no longer fruitful to engage in conversations. And, look, I think you can -- I think pretty much everybody has concluded, after the behavior we've seen from the Russians over the last couple of weeks, that there was little, if anything, to be gained from continuing to talk to them about this. They were not serious about living up to their commitments. And that has tragic consequences for the situation in Syria, there's no denying that.\nQ: Is this is a recognition that the policy of reaching a political agreement in Syria has failed?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, no -- primarily because the, again, as I was mentioning to Ron, everybody who has looked at this situation, I think -- just about everybody -- has acknowledged that there's no military solution to this problem. There's a role for the United States military to play in terms of countering extremists and certainly taking off the battlefield those who would use the chaos in Syria to threaten the United States.\nSo there is a robust military effort underway to protect the American people. But addressing the root cause of this chaos inside of Syria is going to require diplomacy and a political transition. And it's not just the United States that believes that. The rest of the international community, including Russia, has acknowledged that that's the case.\nSo the tactic, if you will, that the United States was attempting to employ was to capitalize on one area of common ground. The United States believes a political transition inside of Syria is necessary. Russia believes that a political transition inside of Syria is necessary. Both countries also acknowledge the threat from extremism. And the hope was that the Russians would use their diplomatic influence with the Assad regime to reduce the violence inside of Syria, allow for the flow of humanitarian assistance inside of Syria, and create space for a diplomatic solution or a political solution inside of Syria. And in --\nQ: But you're saying that that failed -- that entire calculation was wrong.\nMR. EARNEST: And in exchange, the United States would be in a position where we would offer to coordinate our efforts militarily with the Russians to strengthen our focus on extremists.\nFrom the beginning, there's been skepticism about whether or not Russia would live up to the commitments that they've made in the context of applying that pressure to the Assad regime. And unfortunately, this is situation where the healthy skepticism turned out to be right. But it does not change anybody's view here in the administration that for all of our military efforts inside of Syria to keep the American people safe, the ultimate solution to the situation in Syria is not one that can be solely military in nature. We're going to need to see a negotiated political transition inside of Syria. The Russians themselves have acknowledged this. And that's what will be necessary to bring an end to the violence and the terrible humanitarian situation that we see in that country.\nQ: But to be clear, with this suspension and the withdrawal of the personnel for future military coordination that's not going to happen, that with this suspension are you not saying that the Obama administration is done trying to seek a diplomatic solution with Russia in Syria?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what is clear is the Obama administration has concluded that Russia has no intention of living up to the commitments that they've made in the context of negotiations around the Cessation of Hostilities. And once you've reached that conclusion, I'm not really sure what else there is to talk about.\nAnd again, I'm not papering over the tragic consequences that this is going to have for Syria. This was our -- this was a reasonable, thought-through strategy for applying pressure to the Assad regime in pursuit of the aims that we were seeking to achieve. We're going to have to pursue an alternative approach. But I don't have much to say about that right now.\nQ: But do you not stand to note the Russian Foreign Ministry has put out a number of statements this morning -- Vladimir Putin himself signed off -- as you've talked about, the suspension of the destruction of plutonium that they previously pledged to go through with. They're talking about destruction of any trust between the U.S. and Russia. I mean, it would seem that tension with Russia is escalating here. Do you not see these statements and these pledges from Vladimir Putin as him trying to exert some leverage on the United States? Do you not see that as linked in any way to this failure?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think to discern the actual motivations and intentions of President Putin, you probably have to ask him yourself, and you'd have to determine whether or not he's being honest with you. What is clear is that Russia is isolated more than they've ever been before, and they have been subject to rounds of international condemnation because of either actions that they have taken directly, or actions that they have aided and abetted inside of Syria that have led to widespread death and destruction among civilian populations. And that might lead some people to start making increasingly outrageous claims to try to avoid that isolation or to try to avoid that international condemnation. So again, for Russia's true intentions, you'd have to consult with them directly.\nBut look, there's disappointment that Russia has not -- was unwilling to live up to the commitments that they'd made. The agreement that Secretary Kerry worked tirelessly to try to reach acknowledged Russia's inherent and healthy self-interest in this situation. Russia has acknowledged that a political transition in Syria is necessary. Russia has acknowledged that they face a very serious and urgent threat from extremists that are using chaos in Syria to plot and carry out attacks around the world. Russia has a lot on the hook -- Russia has a lot on the line. And right now they don't have that much to show for it. Are they going to continue to pursue a strategy where they bomb civilian populations into submission? And over time, will that allow them to make more progress? It might. We'll see. But a whole lot more innocent people are going to die, and the Russians will be increasingly isolated, and there will be an international price to pay in terms of their weakening standing in the international community.\nQ: But because of that kind of mass murder you're talking about, some people do feel that there is a sense of urgency, or there should be one. So, right now, what's the consequence for continuing to carry out what other countries have called war crimes in Aleppo? Is the U.S. considering sanctions against Russia? I mean, now it does look like the artifice is gone, there is a lot of tension with Russia on this issue and many others. I mean, what is the White House thinking when it comes to actually perhaps taking any kind of action to stop the humanitarian catastrophe inside of Aleppo if you can't bargain the Russians out of it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think there was a lot of tension around this relationship even in the midst of these negotiations. I think what's also true is we've acknowledged previously, I've acknowledged previously, that there are range of tools available to the United States, including the use of sanctions that have proved to be an increasingly effective and powerful tool. But look, the United States also worked effectively with our European partners to implement sanctions against Russia because of their violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity. And we haven't seen the kind of change in strategy in Ukraine that we'd like to see yet either.\nSo the President is going to consider a range of options, and the President is regularly being updated by his national security team about the options that are available to him. And this is something that they certainly will be talking about more frequently in the days ahead, considering that the United States is no longer engaged in talks with the Russians.\nQ: Thanks Josh. I got a couple on the Russians and then something unrelated. Will the United States continue to implement the plutonium arrangement even if the Russians have dropped out?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Olivier, we've just heard this announcement from the Russians today. So the United States has been very serious about keeping our commitments all along, and we certainly would like to see the Russians do the same thing. I don't have any changes to our posture to announce at this point.\nQ: You've seen the Russian conditions for resuming the plutonium arrangement, I think -- end to sanctions, some kind of compensation, and a drawdown of NATO. I'm going to guess you don't embrace these with open arms, but what is the administration's position on those condition?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I haven't looked at them in detail. I think what I would just point out is that the United States and Russia reached an agreement in the last decade that's been in force for five years. We've kept up our end of the bargain, and they should do the same thing. I'm not really sure what the goal of renegotiating an already-agreed-to agreement would be.\nQ: All right. Bear with me, I'm going to read this; it's from the New York Magazine interview with the President: \"I think you could see over the horizon a situation in which, without Congress showing much interest in restraining actions with authorizations that were written really broadly, you end up with a President who can carry on perpetual wars all over the world and a lot of them covert without any accountability or democratic debate.\"\nWhat struck me was, \"over the horizon,\" because it feels to me like that is potentially the situation we're in now. Libya wasn't congressionally authorized. There are covert actions all around the world. What's the difference between the current state of affairs and this \"over the horizon\" state of affairs?\nMR. EARNEST: Olivier, what the President was referring to in that quote, and I'm glad you asked this question, is he was talking about the situation that he inherited.\nIn the early days of the administration, he was considering the tools that had been made available to him and considering the way in which they were being used, and he was considering how \"over the horizon\" was a scenario in which there would not be sufficient transparency in place to constrain this extraordinary authority that, based on new technology, could be wielded by the President of the United States.\nAnd what the President and his team have steadily worked to do is to try to impose greater transparency and to impose constraints that would address those concerns that the President had from his earliest days in office. Does that make sense?\nQ: It does. I hadn't read it at all as a state of affairs inherited. It sounded more down the road.\nMR. EARNEST: Got it. Yeah, so the way that the story was set up is, the President was sort of evaluating different points in his presidency where he'd made decisions that had long-term consequences. So he went back to when he made this decision to make this a priority.\nKaren.\nQ: Josh, has the President received the briefing of the potential impact of Hurricane Matthew? And the Pentagon has partially evacuated some personnel from Guantanamo. Is there any concern about the storm having an impact on operations there? And what's the plan for 61 detainees?\nMR. EARNEST: Thank you for asking. I was just contemplating that I was going to have to do that at the very end, so I appreciate you bringing this up.\nWith regard to the situation at the U.S. military facility at Guantanamo Bay, I'd refer you to my colleagues at the Department of Defense. They obviously are engaged in planning to ensure the safety and security of all the personnel on the base in advance of the storm.\nI can tell you that the President was first briefed over the weekend in the aftermath of the unexpected and rapid strengthening of Hurricane Matthew. The President expects he'll continue to be updated as necessary, at least daily, on the forecast track for Hurricane Matthew and the latest analysis about its potential impact on the United States and the Caribbean.\nThere are some actions that have already been taken. Let me just walk through a couple of those with you right now. FEMA is deploying officials to state emergency operations centers in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. It's my understanding that that should hopefully be completed by the end of the day today, and there may actually already be personnel in some of those places already.\nFEMA also has incident support bases in Georgia and North Carolina in order to pre-position response supplies. This is a relatively new strategy that you've seen from FEMA, which is that they will look for locations that are just outside the track of the storm to pre-position supplies so that there is a shorter distance for those supplies to be transported in the immediate aftermath of the storm. That can expedite needed assistance.\nIn the meantime, the impact of this storm is not likely to be felt in the United States for several days, but we certainly encourage anyone potentially in affected states, from Florida through the mid-Atlantic, to take steps to prepare. And information on what to do is at Ready.gov and on the FEMA smartphone app.\nIn addition, you should also be aware that the USAID Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance has deployed two disaster response teams to Haiti and Jamaica in advance of the storm's arrival. These disaster experts are actively monitoring the storm's track in real time, and communicating with officials in Jamaica, Haiti, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas, and Belize to coordinate relief efforts if they are requested.\nUSAID has also strategically pre-positioned some relief supplies in anticipation of the storm. Obviously, the concern that we have with regard to Jamaica and Haiti in particular is that these are countries that are, based on the current forecast, likely to take a pretty significant hit from the storm. And these are countries that don't have the kind of infrastructure or the professionalized response operations that we do here in the United States. And given our longstanding relationship with both of those countries, the United States is prepared -- or at least is making preparations to ensure that we can assist in those recovery and response efforts. The President is also being briefed on those efforts. That's something that he's also going to continue to watch closely. And there should be a lot of people saying a lot of prayers for people in the Caribbean right now.\nQ: And one quick. Is there any validity to a Daily Mail piece that the President offered to get Secretary Clinton a medical check-up at Walter Reed, given her health concerns?\nMR. EARNEST: I have not seen that report, but I'm not aware of any such request.\nJC.\nQ: Follow-up a little bit on what Olivier was talking about \"over the horizon.\" What is really not clear is, what is the endgame for Mr. Assad? I mean, he's not going to just walk away and live in the villa in the South of France somewhere, like a deposed putin-tate -- potentate, I should say. Actually Freudian slip --\nMR. EARNEST: You just coined a new term.\nQ: It was actually intended, I think. Since he it --\nMR. EARNEST: Please attribute to Jon-Christopher Bua, everybody, when you use this in your pieces. (Laughter.)\nQ: JC, whatever. The fact is that, that Assad is Putin's guy, and it seems like Putin will not allow what happened to Muammar Qaddafi to happen to his boy, Assad. So the question is, what is the endgame? What will happen to Assad? What's the thought here?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, JC, you've asked a provocative question. I don't think anybody knows exactly how this gets resolved. Everybody, including the Russians, has acknowledged that a political transition is necessary.\nQ: Everyone has stated that.\nMR. EARNEST: Everyone has stated that. And look, what is clear is that President Assad -- Putin's guy, as you described him -- has gotten Putin into a mess.\nYou'll recall that Syria used to be -- and still is -- the only country outside of the former Soviet bloc that was home to a Russia military base. So the strategic significance of Syria for Russia was significant. And, as a result, Russia had invested pretty deeply in the country because of their military presence that was tolerated there. The stability of that country has been shattered, and Russia is now investing significant resources to try to protect the previous investment that they've made there. Russia has, we know, sent significant quantities of military equipment. They've sent military personnel. They've spent significant funds -- funds that they don't have. We've talked at some length about the declining strength of the Russian economy.\nAs a result of their actions inside of Syria, Russia is deeply isolated and has earned the stern rebuke of the international community for their actions. Russia has also gotten themselves knee-deep into a sectarian quagmire that fuels extremism and only increases the risk to Russia's security back home. All of that because President Putin is looking out for his guy.\nSo, that being the state of affairs, that is the hope that the United States had previously had, that Russia would be willing to broker some kind of diplomatic agreement where they would use their influence with the Assad regime to reduce the violence, to increase the flow of humanitarian assistance, and sharpen the ability that they have to go after extremists. But that is an agreement that Russia was unwilling to live up to. And it's unfortunate, both when you consider Russia's national security interests but also when you consider the lives of millions of innocent Syrians that are still trapped in that country.\nQ: So, in a sense, Assad has it both ways. He's being protected and he's being allowed to continue his ways.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, he is allowed to remain in power because he's being propped up by the Russians and the Iranians. And I think the question really is, what are the Iranians and the Russians getting out of it. And we know that they are paying some significant costs, and we know that the Russian economy is such that they don't have as many resources to pay those costs as they used to. But we'll have to see what happens from here.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I want to follow up on Karen's question about the detainees over at Gitmo. Given the trajectory of Matthew right now, the President would still have a hand in determining whether or not those detainees were removed from Gitmo and where they might be placed, is that true?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Department of Defense officials will take all the necessary steps that need to be taken in order to ensure the safety of everybody at Gitmo.\nQ: Including the President's determination for the destination of the detainees, correct?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not quite sure what you're getting at.\nQ: Ultimately, it's his call where they go.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, he is Commander-in-Chief, right? But when it comes to something like the safety and security of a military installation, there are people a little further down the chain of command who can make the appropriate decisions about what precautions need to be taken to ensure everybody's safety and security at a major military facility.\nQ: Let me ask you about Obamacare. Open enrollment about four weeks away. I read a report over the weekend about rates skyrocketing in Minnesota, for example, some 67 percent. There are now four states with just one single insurer, a couple in the south. You and I have talked about that -- Arkansas and Alabama. The others are Oklahoma and Wyoming. What's the President's assessment of where Obamacare is at this stage of this presidency? Does it need a fix? And if so, does he have one that he's proposing?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, the President is quite proud that Obamacare, as has been dubbed by many, is one that has expanded health care coverage for 20 million Americans. Millions more Americans who already had health insurance now benefit from the kinds of consumer protections that were included in the Obamacare legislation. These are things that allow you to get a free annual check-up every year, or giving you the comfort of knowing that you're not going to get thrown off your health insurance if you get sick, that you're never going to have to go through bankruptcy court just because somebody in your family gets sick.\nThose are protections that the American people didn't previously enjoy. Now every American that has health insurance enjoys those kinds of protections. And that is a -- that's why you've heard me say on many occasions that Obamacare is here to stay. And it's why the President is so proud of that domestic accomplishment.\nWhat I would also say is that since the very first day the President signed this bill into law, he acknowledged an openness to working with Democrats or Republicans in Congress to further strengthen it. And we have seen a sustained commitment on the part of Republicans to trying to tear down that law. They voted some 50 times to repeal it. They've gone to the Supreme Court a couple of different times to try to have it invalidated. All those efforts have been unsuccessful. Basically, every day Republicans promised to offer up their own alternative. They haven't yet. That's an indication that Republicans have not been interested in having a serious conversation about what can be done to strengthen the health insurance reform proposals that have already been enacted under President Obama's leadership.\nThe President does have some ideas for things that we could do to further strengthen Obamacare. The first is to find a way to ensure that every state across the country is expanding Medicaid, consistent with what was envisioned in the law. There are too many Republican governors that have resisted that effort. And that means that there are hundreds of thousands, if not millions of Americans, that could have health insurance right now, today, paid for almost entirely by the federal government that aren't just because of the political differences that some Republican governors have with the President of the United States. That's petty. It's small-minded. And it's having a consequence for the lives of millions of Americans. And it's rather unfortunate.\nIn addition to that, the President has also put forward an idea that was discussed, actually, in the original legislative debate around the Affordable Care Act, which is implementing a so-called public option, allowing essentially a publicly funded health care plan that would compete with private sector proposals, and that this would have the effect of encouraging more competition in the marketplace and limiting the growth in health care costs. Republicans have been resistant to that, unfortunately.\nSo the President has some ideas. The President put these ideas forward. The President is under no illusions that those kinds of reforms to strengthen Obamacare will be initiated while he is still in office, but he's hopeful that maybe under the leadership of a new President and a new Congress that those kinds of reforms would take place.\nQ: Can I also ask you about some of the issues that are going on today? Skyrocketing costs for consumers in Minnesota, for example; single insurers in those four states that I mentioned. That's not what the President promised when he promised that Obamacare, or the Affordable Care Act, would not only expand health care opportunities, it would also drive down costs.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what we have seen, Kevin, is we have seen that for the vast majority of people who do get health care coverage through their employers -- so it's about 15 *less than 5 percent of Americans that turn to the marketplaces that you're referring to -- that there are encouraging statistics about the way that growth of that employer-provided health insurance has been limited.\nBut, look, the President believes that there's more that can be done. It's important to remember that before the Affordable Care Act went into effect, we saw every year significant skyrocketing health care costs. So this is not a new phenomenon. And the question is, to what extent has the Affordable Care Act been effective in limiting the growth in their health care costs. And what we have seen is that they have been effective in limiting some of that growth, but there is more that we could do to make it much more effective. And we're going to need some action from Congress in order to get that done.\nQ: Lastly, I want to follow up on JC for just a second. Is the administration concerned about Julian Assange and his planned video appearance on Tuesday? And what's the White House's view on the allegations that he cancelled his original plans for what he called security reasons?\nMR. EARNEST: I have no idea what he's talking about.\nToluse.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. In some leaked audio from a Hillary Clinton fundraiser earlier this year, she expressed some doubts about the President's -- or the administration's nuclear modernization efforts, saying the last thing that we need are sophisticated cruise missiles that are nuclear-armed. Does the White House have a reaction to her expressing some doubts about the rationale behind what it's doing on its nuclear program?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Toluse, I actually have not seen the authenticity of those comments be verified, so I'll let Secretary Clinton and her team discuss her position on those issues. President Obama has spoken at some length about the priority that he's placed on nuclear security, limiting nuclear proliferation, while also preserving the kind of nuclear deterrent that protects some global stability until we reach a point in time that we can live in a world without nuclear weapons.\nAnd the President has made some important progress in pursuit of those goals, including some commitments that we've seen from other countries to secure and, in some cases, even dispose of loose nuclear materials. The President convened a summit every two years with world leaders to consider what countries around the world could do to make commitments to enhance nuclear security in a way that didn't just benefit the United States, but actually benefitted the entire international community.\nSo the President's track record on this is strong. But this is also -- this falls in the category of long-range policy planning. And the President has certainly done his part, but there will be future presidents that will need to do their part to improve our nuclear security and to eventually envision a -- to make real the vision of a world without nuclear weapons.\nQ: I also wanted to ask you about something the President said in a radio interview with the Steve Harvey Morning Show. He said it's never been easier to cast your ballot -- he was talking about voting. It seems to contradict some of the things he's said about Republicans making it harder to vote. And at South by Southwest earlier this year, he said, \"We're the only advanced democracy in the world that makes it harder for people to vote…and we systematically put barriers and make it as hard as possible for citizens to vote.\" So does he believe it's as easy, it's possible, or easy as it's ever been to cast a ballot? Or how do you sort of square that --\nMR. EARNEST: Toluse, I think he was short-handing a little bit. He was basically making the case it's never been easier to make a decision about who you should cast your ballot for. But, yes, it is unfortunate that in too many states Republicans have made it much more difficult than it needs to be for people to exercise their constitutional right to vote.\nQ: Finally, the South by South Lawn event -- do you have any information about how much this costs, who pays for it, whether or not there's any type of sponsorships or anything like that, like how this compares to South by Southwest event?\nMR. EARNEST: We can get you some more information about that. I don't have that off the top of my head, but we can follow up with you on that.\nAnita, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Two quick things. One -- by the way, I don't know if you can hear it, but it's like you can hear screaming from outside.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes. I assume they're cheering for me.\nQ: I assume it's all happy.\nMR. EARNEST: They're really just loving these answers, and really a lot of enthusiasm from the crowd.\nQ: I was wondering, tomorrow obviously there's the vice-presidential debate, and I know that the President and Senator Kaine have gone way back and are good friends. I wondered if you knew if he had talked to him and sort of given him any advice. This is probably the biggest political moment he has had in his career so far -- will be tomorrow. Any thoughts about that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President does have enormous respect and admiration for Senator Kaine. And Senator Kaine was one of the first statewide elected officials in the country to announce his support for Senator Obama's presidential campaign. That kind of political courage and loyalty that Senator Kaine has shown is something that the President deeply values.\nAnd Senator Kaine did that at a time when that was not an obvious political decision to be made. In fact, the rather obvious political calculation was to not announce your vocal support for then-Senator Obama's presidential campaign, because at the time President Obama was polling in the teens, as I recall. But Senator Kaine, to his credit, showed some courage and made a decision early on to support Senator Obama's presidential campaign, and the President enormously respects that show of political courage that is all too rare in the current political environment.\nI'm not aware that they've had an opportunity to speak recently. President Obama obviously saw Senator Kaine at the convention in Philadelphia. They spoke on the same night. And so I know they had the opportunity to visit then. I don't know if they've had a chance to talk since.\nQ: Do they talk regularly?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know that they talk regularly, no -- particularly now that Senator Kaine is keeping a very busy schedule that he is as a running mate who is campaigning for the vice presidential job. So I don't know -- I know that they do not talk regularly. I don't know that they have spoken since they were in Philly together a couple months ago.\nQ: Last week, at one of the briefings, you mentioned that -- and a new month has happened, it's now -- it's October. I think last week you mentioned that we were going to see President Obama doing a couple events a week for Hillary Clinton. Are we now at that moment that it's October -- was that what you were referring to? Or was there a time on that --\nMR. EARNEST: The only campaign travel that I'm aware of for this week is President Obama's trip to South Florida on Wednesday. I'm not aware of any additional political travel this week. But stay tuned and we'll keep you updated on travel for the rest of the week.\nQ: -- it was a couple times a week, you said.\nMR. EARNEST: A couple times a week. I'm actually reminded of a conversation I had what seems like hours ago, but it was shortly before I came out here, which is that the President is traveling to Chicago this weekend and will be engaged in some political activities there. Obviously, I do not anticipate that Illinois is going to be a battleground state. You can consult the Trump campaign to see if they have a different calculation. But I would expect that the President will be engaged in some activities there that will be helpful to Secretary Clinton's campaign. So stay tuned on that.\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. EARNEST: I know there's been some talk about that. We'll keep you updated on the President's schedule as we get it. Okay?\nQ: Do a couple of activities mean fundraising, too? Is that what you meant? I just want to clarify.\nMR. EARNEST: As the President's schedule gets determined for Chicago, we'll keep you posted.\nThanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 2:40 P.M.

Think about it—if you had to choose any time in the course of human history to be alive, you'd choose this one. Right here, right now, right in America.\nNew technologies and new innovations are transforming the way we live, opening up incredible opportunities to create, to discover, and to do what we never thought possible.\nAt the same time, we have to navigate these changes in a smart way. They also can be disruptive, even scary—and sometimes, they leave folks behind.\nOur task is to come together and build a future that's more inclusive, tolerant, and full of opportunity for everybody. And I've never been more optimistic that we will.\nAs President, I've spent the last eight years finding the best people to help us meet that challenge. People who reject cynicism. People who turn change into a force for good. People who believe that, no matter who we are, where we come from, who we love, or what God we pray to, we—the people—can create a world that's worthy of our brightest hopes.\nSo today, I'm inviting a bunch of these folks to my backyard for South by South Lawn.\nMuch like the festival I dropped by in Austin earlier this year, SXSL is, at its heart, a call to action. The folks out on the lawn today are artists, creators, entrepreneurs, and innovators who will share how they've used their unique skills to engage their communities in making the change they want to see—whether it's curing cancer, fighting poverty, empowering women, and so much more.\nWe'll welcome people like Jukay Hsu, an Iraq War veteran with a Bronze Star for his service to our country who uses technology to build a path out of poverty for people in Queens. Or Oscar Menjivar, who is pushing schools in Los Angeles to bring technology into the classroom so kids can get a head start on coding. Or Dr. Nina Tandon, the founder of the world's first company growing living human bones to help with reconstruction and recovery.\nThose are just a few of the incredible people you'll see out at South by South Lawn all day today. And believe me—it's a sight to see.\nWe've got an art installation made entirely of sticky notes where people share how they will make a positive impact where they live. We've got a virtual reality exhibit where people can experience what it's like to live in solitary confinement and learn firsthand why it should be banned from our prisons.\nWe'll discuss questions that will define the coming decades: How do we harness technology to solve our most stubborn problems? How will we sustainably feed ourselves in the near future? How do we foster innovation in the heart of our cities? How do we, as citizens, engage to bring about lasting change?\nAnd I'll join a conversation with Dr. Katherine Hayhoe, a climate scientist, and Leonardo DiCaprio, a longtime ally in the fight against climate change, to explore how we can move forward in our efforts to protect the one planet we've got. Leo is also debuting his documentary film on climate change tonight.\nGiven his day job, I'm betting it's pretty good.\nSo join us today on the South Lawn to see how you can lend a hand in building a world we want to live in.\nThat's our responsibility as citizens. That doesn't mean this has be your full-time job. It doesn't mean you have to run for office or launch a start-up. But it does mean that whatever field you're in, whatever skill you have, whatever passion you're pursuing, you can find a way to engage, to participate, and to make a difference.\nSee you on the lawn,\nPRESIDENT OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-10-03", "title": "Statement on the White House South by South Lawn Festival"}

And far too many precious lives are being taken from us as a result of drug overdoses, leaving families devastated and heartbroken. Substance use can also lead to lower academic achievement and a variety of physical and emotional consequences, and it is crucial that America's youth learn and understand the risks connected with it. Youth substance use can be prevented—and with dedicated, collective effort across our communities, we can ensure more Americans live long, productive lives. During National Youth Substance Use and Substance Use Disorder Prevention Month, we come together in common purpose to unite behind this important mission.\nMy Administration's National Drug Control Strategy has enabled us to amplify prevention efforts by working with States to implement evidence-based strategies that support communities and strengthen drug-free programs. Every dollar invested in school-based substance use prevention programs can save nearly $18 in costs related to the disease of substance use disorder later on. We must facilitate open discussions with families and children—as well as health care providers—about the dangers posed by the misuse of prescription drugs, because for many individuals, their opioid use disorder starts by misusing prescription medications found in their home medicine cabinet. This is especially important because our Nation is currently facing an opioid epidemic, including a near quadrupling of opioid overdose deaths since 1999. That is why I continue to call on the Congress to provide $1.1 billion to expand access to treatment services for prescription opioid misuse and heroin use.\nWith evidence-based approaches and community-led prevention activities, we can improve health and safety and give our young people the tools they need to make smart decisions. Parents, guardians, teachers, coaches, community members, and the health care community can all play a part in promoting substance use prevention efforts. This month, let us continue taking every step possible to increase these efforts for our young people—and for all Americans—so that they may pursue a bright future filled with possibility and opportunity.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2016 as National Youth Substance Use and Substance Use Disorder Prevention Month. I call upon all Americans to engage in appropriate programs and activities to promote comprehensive prevention efforts to reduce youth substance use and substance use disorders within their communities.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

Hello, everybody.\nActor and producer Leonardo DiCaprio. I want to thank you all for coming here this evening. I want to particularly thank our President for his extraordinary environmental leadership. [Applause]\nThe President. Thank you.\nMr. DiCaprio. Most recently, in protecting our oceans.\nKatharine, thank you for the great work you do on climate change and in helping improve preparedness of communities to deal with the impacts of climate change.\nAnd thank all of you for showing up here this evening.\nTonight I am pleased to present the U.S. premier of my new documentary, \"Before the Flood.\" This was a 3-year endeavor on the part of myself and my director, Fisher Stevens. Together, we traveled from China to India, to Greenland, to the Arctic, Indonesia to Micronesia, to Miami to learn more about the effects of climate change on our planet and highlight the message from the scientific community and leaders worldwide on the urgency of the issue.\nThis film was developed to show the devastating impacts that climate change is having on our planet and, more importantly, what can be done. Our intention for the film was to be released before this upcoming election, because, after experiencing firsthand the devastating impacts of climate change worldwide, we, like many of you here today, realize that urgent action must be taken.\nThis moment is more important than ever. We must empower leaders who not only believe in climate change, but are willing to do something about it. The scientific consensus is in, and the argument is now over. If you do not believe in climate change, you do not believe in facts or in science or empirical truths, and therefore, in my humble opinion, should not be allowed to hold public office.\nSo, with that, I'm so very honored and pleased to be joined onstage with one of those leaders, a President who has done more to create solutions for the climate crisis than any other in history, President Barack Obama.\nThe President. Yay! Thank you.\nMr. DiCaprio. Along with leading climate scientist, Katharine Hayhoe, for this conversation about how we can make real progress on this issue.\nThe President's Environmental Accomplishments/Paris Agreement on Climate Change\nSo, with that, let us begin with the first question. President Obama, you're nearing the end of your second term as President. You've had an opportunity to reflect on the issues facing our country and our planet. How do you grade the global response to the climate change movement thus far? The President. We get an incomplete. But the good news is, we can still pass the course if we make some good decisions now.\nSo, first of all, I just want to thank everybody who's been here, all day, some of you; everybody who's been involved in South by South Lawn. It looked really fun. [Laughter] I was not allowed to have fun today. I had to work, although I did take some time—you guys may have noticed—to take a picture with one of the Lego men. [Laughter]\nAudience member. Happy anniversary, Mr. President!\nThe President. Thank you. It is my anniversary today. We celebrated it yesterday, yes; 24 years FLOTUS has put up with me. [Laughter]\nI want to thank Leo for the terrific job he's done in producing the film, along with Fisher. All of you will have a chance to see it at its premier tonight. And I think after watching it, it will give you a much better sense of the stakes involved and why it's so important for all of us to be engaged.\nAnd I want to thank Katharine from Texas Tech.\nAudience member. Woo!\nThe President. We've got to give—there we go. We've got a couple Texas Tech folks in here. But because Katharine, in addition of being an outstanding climate scientist, is a person of deep faith, and she has really done some amazing stuff to reach out to some unconventional audiences to start fostering a broader coalition around this issue.\nTo your question, Leo, we are very proud of the work that we've been able to do over the last 8 years here in the United States: doubling fuel efficiency standards on cars; really ramping up our investment in clean energy so that we've doubled the production of clean energy since I came into office. We have increased wind power threefold. We've increased the production of solar power thirtyfold. We have, as a consequence, slowed our emissions and reduced the pace at which we are emitting carbon dioxide in the atmosphere faster than any other advanced nation.\nAnd that's the good news. The other big piece of good news was the Paris Agreement, which we were finally able to get done. And for those of you who are not as familiar with it, essentially what the Paris Agreement did was, for the first time, mobilize 200 nations around the world to sign up, agree to specific steps they are going to take in order to begin to bend the curve and start reducing carbon emissions.\nNow, not every country is doing the exact same thing because not every country produces the same amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, per capita. So the expectation is, is that a country like the United States is going to do more than a small, underdeveloped country that doesn't have the same scale of emissions.\nBut the good news about the Paris Agreement was, it committed everybody to do something. And although, if you add it up, all the commitments that were made by all twenty—200 nations, it would still not be sufficient to deal with the pace of warming that we're seeing in the atmosphere. What it does do is set up for the first time the architecture, the mechanism whereby we can consistently start turning up the dials and reducing the amount of carbon pollution that we're putting into the atmosphere.\nAnd one last piece of good news about that is that I anticipate that this agreement will actually go into force in the next few weeks. India, just this past week, signed on. Mr. DiCaprio. Big deal.\nTexas Tech University Climate Science Center Director Katharine Hayhoe. Yes, huge.\nThe President. And we're going to get a few more nations signing on. And so, officially, this agreement will be into force much faster than I think many of us anticipated when we first organized it.\nLast two points, little tidbits of good news. This week, we'll begin negotiations on an aviation agreement, an international aviation agreement, where all airlines and major carriers around the world begin to figure out how they can reduce the amount of greenhouse gases that they're emitting——\nMs. Hayhoe. That's huge.\nThe President. ——which can make a big difference. And over the next couple weeks, we're also going to be negotiating around something called hydrofluorocarbons—or HFCs—which are other sources of greenhouse gases that, if we are able to reduce them, can have a big impact as well.\nSo even with the Paris Agreement done, we're still pushing forward hard in every area that we can to keep making progress. But, having said all that—and this is where you'll need to hear from Katharine, because in the nicest way possible, she's going to scare the heck out of you as a precursor to the film—what we're seeing is that climate change is happening even faster than the predictions would have told us 5 years ago or 10 years ago. What we're seeing is changes in climate patterns that are on the more pessimistic end of what was possible—the ranges that had been discerned or anticipated by our scientists—which means we're really in a race against time.\nAnd part of what I'm hoping everybody here comes away from is hope that we can actually do something about it, but also a sense of urgency that this is not going to be something that we can just kind of mosey along about and put up with climate denial or obstructionist politics for very long if in fact we want to leave for the next generation beautiful days like today. So—[applause].\nMr. DiCaprio. With that, Katharine, all the environmental crises we face have a huge toll on humanity—on poverty, security, public health, and disaster preparedness. The interconnected nature of our climate means that no country or community is going to be immune to any of these threats. What are the most urgent threats to our modern day civilization? And where do you feel the solutions lie?\nMs. Hayhoe. Well, how many hours do we have again? [Laughter] It's true, when we think of global issues, we think of poverty, we think of hunger, we think of disease, we think of people dying today from preventable causes that no one should be dying from in 2016.\nAnd when we're confronted with these situations head on—and I, myself, spent a number of years as a child growing up in South America, so I know what this looks like—we think to ourselves, climate change, it's important, but we can deal with it later. We can no longer afford to deal with it later. Because if we want to fix poverty, if we want to fix hunger, if we want to fix inequality, if we want to fix disease and water scarcity, we are pouring all of our money, all of our effort, all of our hope and prayers into a bucket, and the bucket has a hole in the bottom. And that hole is climate change. And it is getting bigger and bigger. To fix the global issues that we all care about, including environmental issues, including humanitarian issues, we can no longer leave climate change out of the picture because we will not be able to fix them without it.\nAlternative and Renewable Energy Sources/Environmental Regulations/Acid Rain/Ozone Depletion\nMr. DiCaprio. Mr. President, in \"Before the Flood,\" we see examples of the environmental impacts of corporate greed—corporate greed from the oil and gas industries, for example, what's happening right now in Standing Rock—but some companies are starting to realize that addressing the climate change issue can actually spur economic activity. How do you get more companies to start moving in this direction, to take fundamental action into their business decision?\nThe President. Well, companies respond to incentives. And the question then becomes, can we harness the power and the creativity of the marketplace to come up with innovation and solutions?\nAnd look, the economics of energy are extremely complicated. But let me just simplify it as much as possible. Dirty fuel is cheap, because we've been doing it a long time, so we know how to burn coal to produce electricity. We know how to burn oil, and we know how to burn gas. And if it weren't for pollution, the natural inclination of everybody would be to say let's go with the cheap stuff.\nAnd particularly when it comes to poorer countries—you take an example like India, where hundreds of millions of people still don't have electricity on a regular basis, and they would like to have the standards of living that, if not immediately as high as ours, at least would mean that they're not engaging in backbreaking work just to feed themselves or keep warm—it's completely understandable that their priority is to create electricity for their people.\nAnd if we're going to be able to solve this problem, we are going to have to come up with new sources of energy that are clean and cheap. Now, that's going to involve research; it's going to involve investment in R&D. And there are going to be startups and innovators, and there are some in this audience who are doing all kinds of amazing things. But it takes time to ramp up these new energy sources. And we're in a battle against time.\nThe best way we can spur that kind of innovation is to either create regulations that say, figure it out, and if you don't figure it out, then you're going to pay a penalty; or to create something like a carbon tax, which gives an economic incentive for businesses to do this.\nNow, I'll be honest with you. If—in the current environment in Congress, and certainly internationally, the likelihood of an immediate carbon tax is a ways away. But if you look at what we're doing just with power plants, a major source of greenhouse gases, we put forward something called the Clean Power Plan—clean power rule—as a centerpiece of our climate change strategy. And we did this under existing authorities under the Environmental Protection Act.\nAnd what we're saying to States is, you can figure out the energy mix, but you've got to figure out how to reduce your carbon emissions, and you need to work with your utilities and you need to work with your companies, and come up with innovative solutions. And we're not going to dictate to you exactly how do you do it, but if you don't start reducing them, you're going to have problems. And we'll come up with a plan for you.\nSo the good news is that in the past, where we create an incentive for companies, it turns out that we're more creative, we're more innovative, we typically solve the problem cheaper, faster than we expected, and we create jobs in the process.\nAnd if you doubt that, I'll just give you two quick examples—because this is probably a pretty young audience, and I know this is going to seem like ancient history, but when I arrived in college in Los Angeles in 1979—[laughter]—I still remember, like, the sunsets were spectacular. I mean, they were just these amazing colors. It was like I'd never seen them before, because I was coming from Hawaii. And I started asking people, why are the sunsets here so spectacular?\nMs. Hayhoe. Yes. Right.\nThe President. They said, well, that's all smog, man. That—it's creating this psychedelic stuff that normally is not seen in nature—[laughter]—because the light is getting filtered in all kinds of weird ways.\nYou couldn't run for more than 10, 15 minutes on an alert day without really choking up, the same way you still do in Beijing. Well, L.A. is not pristine today, but we have substantially reduced smog in Los Angeles because of things like the catalytic converter and really rigorous standards.\nThe same is true with something called acid rain. In the Northeast, there was a time where—Doc, make sure I'm getting this right—it was sulfur dioxides, right?\nMs. Hayhoe. Dioxide, yes.\nThe President. Which was being generated from industrial plants, was going up into the atmosphere and then coming down in rain. It was killing forests all throughout the Northeast. And through the Clean Air Act, they essentially set up the equivalent of a cap-and-trade system. They said, companies, you figure out how to reduce your carbon dioxide emissions; we won't tell you exactly how to do it, but we're going to give you a powerful incentive. We'll penalize you if you don't do it. You can capture some of the gains if you do do it.\nMost of you don't hear anything about acid rain anymore, even though it was huge news 25, 30 years ago, because——\nMs. Hayhoe. We fixed it.\nThe President. We fixed it. And the last example I'll use is the ozone. It used to be that one of the things we were really scared about was the ozone layer was vanishing. And when I was growing up, I wasn't sure exactly what the ozone layer was, but I didn't like the idea that there was a big hole that was developing in the atmosphere. [Laughter] It just didn't sound good. And it turned out that one of the main contributors to this was everybody was using deodorant with aerosol. And so everybody starting getting speed strips or whatever. [Laughter]\nAnd it wasn't that big of an inconvenience. Deodorant companies still made money. But something that I was amazed by—and it gives you a sense of nature's resiliency when we do the right thing—we just got reports over the last couple of months that that hole in the ozone layer is beginning to close, which is amazing. [Applause] Right? And all it took was people not using aerosol deodorant.\nMs. Hayhoe. A few more things. [Laughter] The President. There were a couple other things. I'm exaggerating. [Laughter] Well, but essentially, we regulated the kinds of pollutants that were creating this hole without impeding our economic development. Nobody misses what we didn't—because companies were innovated enough to come up with substitutes that worked just fine.\nAnd that's the basic strategy that we've got to employ here. We've got to give incentives to companies: startups, existing companies. And we're going to have to do that initially, country by country. But America has got to lead the way because not only do we have the highest carbon footprint, per capita, but also because we happen to be the most innovative, dynamic business and entrepreneurial sector in the world. And if we create incentives for ourselves, we will help to fix this problem internationally. I'm absolutely confident of the matter.\nMr. DiCaprio. Back to something you mentioned earlier, Mr. President, which I'd like both of you to talk a little bit about. The United States, as you said, has been the largest contributor to global emission in history. And as you said as well, we need to set the example for the rest of the world to follow. Throughout my journey, most of the scientific community truly believes that the silver bullet to combat this issue is a carbon tax.\nNow, a carbon tax, as complex as it is to implement, I would imagine, is something that needs to be—needs to come from the people. It needs to come from the will of the people, which means there needs to be more awareness about this issue. Do you think that I will get to see a carbon tax in the next decade? [Laughter] Will we get to see this in our lifetime? Because most scientists specifically point to the idea that that's going to be the game-changer.\nThe President. Katharine?\nMs. Hayhoe. Good question. I think he knows the likelihood of that more than I do, but I do know that one of my absolute favorite organizations is Citizens' Climate Lobby, and they are founded on the premise of a simple carbon tax: nothing fancy, no difficult regulations, no 3 feet of code. It's putting a price on carbon to allow the market to then figure out what's the cheapest way to get our energy.\nMr. DiCaprio. Can you explain to our audience what a carbon tax would mean?\nMs. Hayhoe. Sure. In very basic terms, when we burn carbon it has harmful impacts on us, on our health, on our water, on our economy, on our agriculture, even on our national security. By putting a fee on that carbon, it makes certain types of energy more expensive, and it makes other types of energy less expensive.\nAnd the way I like it—there's many different flavors—the kind I like is where that extra revenue is returned to us through our taxes and also used to incentivize technological development.\nMr. DiCaprio. Or it could be given to education, for example.\nMs. Hayhoe. Yes.\nMr. DiCaprio. Bravo. [Laughter]\nKatharine, you live in Texas.\nMs. Hayhoe. I do.\nAudience members. Woo!\nMs. Hayhoe. So do people over there. Mr. DiCaprio. [Laughter] They've experienced unprecedented drought and floods in the past five years, and they're also a major energy producer. As you travel the State, what are the biggest misperceptions you hear about climates—from climate skeptics who often say these changes are the result of the cyclical nature of our planet's temperature patterns? And how do you change their minds?\nMs. Hayhoe. Any of us who pays attention to the weather, we know that we have cold and hot, we have dry, and we have wet. And anybody who has ever been to Texas knows that it looks more like this.\n[Ms. Hayhoe moved her arm up and down in a wave pattern.]\nYes. So you might say, well then why does it matter if our weather is incredibly variably anyways? It matters because in a warmer planet, it's taking that natural pattern of variability and that brings drought and flood, heat and cold, and it is stretching it. So our heavy rainfalls are getting more extreme, because in a warmer atmosphere, the oceans are warmer, so more water evaporates. So the water is just sitting up there waiting for a storm to come through, pick it up, and dump it on us. Just as has happened in recent days, what happened in Baton Rouge a little while ago, and if you read the reports of the meteorologists and the weather people talking about these heavy downpours we are experiencing, you will see this phrase they repeat again and again.\nThe warm oceans—and again this year is a 99 percent chance of being again the warmest year on record after last year and the year before—the warm oceans are providing a nearly infinite source of moisture for these storms. But at the same time, when we are in a dry period, as we get all the time in Texas and its hotter than average, then all of the moisture and soil in our reservoir evaporates quicker leaving us dryer for a longer period of time. So, yes, we know natural cycles are real. But we know that climate change is stretching that natural pattern, impacting us and our economy.\nHere's the cool thing about Texas though. What do you think when you think of Texas?\nThe President. Wind power.\nMs. Hayhoe. Wind power, yes.\nThe President. I cheated, I know.\nMs. Hayhoe. He cheated. He knows the answer. [Laughter] Texas knows energy. And here's the cool thing about Texas. Did you know that already Texas is getting 10 percent of its electricity from wind? On a windy night, we get 50 percent of our energy from wind.\n[At this point, Ms. Hayhoe continued her remarks, concluding as follows.]\nMs. Hayhoe. In Texas, we have entire towns going a hundred-percent renewable because it is the cheapest way for them to get their energy. We have Fort Hood, which is the biggest military installation in the U.S., signing a new electricity contract for wind and solar because they can save the American taxpayer $165 million by going green.\nGreen is no longer just a color of money—or the color of trees, I should say. Green is also increasingly in Texas, around the U.S., and even in China, becoming the color of money as well. Wind and solar are the way of the future. And we're seeing it happen. As a scientist, though, I have to say my only concern is, we're not seeing it happen fast enough. Politics of Climate Change/Alternative and Renewable Energy Sources/Coal, Natural Gas, and Nuclear Energy\nMr. DiCaprio. Mr. President, this has been an unusual election year, to say the least. [Laughter] And Gallup regularly polls Americans with an open-ended question about the issues that matter most to them. And the environment consistently polls low on that list, around 2 percent. As you know, climate change is a long-term problem that requires long-term solutions. How can we all do better—do a better job of engaging the public, especially those who are skeptical, in a meaningful and productive debate about the urgency of these issues and inspire them to be a part of the solution now?\nThe President. Well, climate change is almost perversely designed to be really hard to solve politically because it is a problem that creeps up on you. There's no single hurricane or tornado or drought or forest fire that you can directly attribute to climate change. What you know is, is that as the planet gets warmer, the likelihood of what used to be, say, a 100-year flood—it's supposed to happen only every 100 years—suddenly starts happening every 5 years, or every 2 years.\nAnd so the odds just increase of extreme weather patterns. But people, they don't see it as directly correlated. And the political system in every country is not well designed to do something tough now to solve a problem that people are really going to feel the impacts of in the future. The natural inclination of political systems is to push that stuff off as long as possible.\nSo if we are going to solve this problem, then we're going to need some remarkable innovation. I mean, Katharine is exactly right that solar and wind is becoming a job generator and an economic development engine. But what's also true is, we're going to need some real innovation in things like, for example, battery storage. How do we keep wind and solar stored without too much leakage so that when the wind is not blowing or the sun is not shining, we still have regular energy power. We're still going to need some really big technological breakthroughs.\nBut with the technology that we have right now, my goal has been to build that bridge to this clean energy future. To make sure that over the next 20 years, using existing technologies, we do everything we can even as we're creating the even more innovative technology, so that by the time those technologies are ready, we haven't already created an irreversible problem.\nAnd that's going to require mobilization. It is going to require us all doing a better job of educating ourselves, our friends, our neighbors, our coworkers, and ultimately, expressing that in the polls. And in order to do that, I think it is important for those of us who care deeply about this—and Katharine is a wonderful example of the right way to do it—to not be dismissive of people's concerns when it comes to what will this mean for me and my family. Right?\nSo if you're a working-class family, and dad has to drive 50 miles to get to his job, and he does—he can't afford to buy a Tesla or a Prius, and the most important thing to him economically to make sure he can pay the bills at the end of the month is the price of gas, and when gas prices are low that means an extra 100 bucks in his pocket or 200 bucks in his pocket, and that may make the difference about whether or not he can buy enough food for his kids—if you just start lecturing him about climate change and what's going to happen to the planet 50 years from now, it's just not going to register.\nSo part of what we have to do, I think, is to engage, talk about the science, talk about the concrete effects of climate change. We have to make it visual, and we have to make it vivid in ways that people can understand. But then, we also have to recognize that this transition is not going to happen overnight, and you're not starting from scratch. People are locked into existing ways of doing business.\nI'm—look, part of the reason we have such a big carbon footprint is our entire society is built around Interstate Highway Systems and cars. And we can't, overnight, suddenly just start having everybody taking high-speed trains because we don't have any high-speed trains to take. And we have to build them.\nMs. Hayhoe. Yes, right. [Laughter]\nThe President. And we should start building them. But in the meantime, people have to get to work.\nSo I think having an understanding that we're not going to complete this transition overnight, that there are going to be some compromises along the way, that that's frustrating because the science tells us we don't have time to compromise; on the other hand, if we actually want to get something done, then we've got to take people's immediate, current views into account. That's how we're going to move the ball forward.\nAnd I'll just give you one example. And this is—generally, I get—this is a pretty sympathetic crowd, but some folks will push back on this. When you think about coal, we've significantly reduced the amount of power that we're generating from coal. And it's going to continue to go down. Well, number one, coalminers feel like we—they've been battered, and they often blame me and my tree-hugger friends—[laughter]—for having created real economic problems in places like West Virginia or parts of Kentucky or parts of my home State of southern Illinois.\nInterestingly enough, one of the reasons why we've seen a significant reduction of coal usage in the United States is not because of our regulations. It's been because natural gas got really cheap as a consequence of fracking. Now, there are a lot of environmentalists who absolutely object to fracking because their attitude is, sometimes, it's done really sloppy and releases methane that is even a worse greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. It leaks into people's water supplies and aquifers and when done improperly can really harm a lot of people. And their attitude is, we've got to leave that stuff in the ground if we're going to solve climate change.\nAnd I get all that. On the other hand, the fact that we're transitioning from coal to natural gas means less greenhouse gases. Same thing with nuclear power. People don't like nuclear power because they have visions of Chernobyl or Three Mile Island, what are we doing with the storage of the waste. Nuclear power generally evokes a lot of stuff in our imaginations. But clean—nuclear power doesn't emit greenhouse gases.\nSo we've got to make some decisions. If we're going to get India or China to actually sign on to reducing carbon emissions, then we're going to have to have a conversation with them about nuclear power and help them with technologies that ensure safety, and we can figure out how to store it until we invent the perfect energy source—lithium crystals or whatever, and Scotty is there beaming us up. [Laughter]. But until then, we've got to live in the real world.\nSo I say all that not because I don't recognize the urgency of the problem. It is because we're going to have to straddle between the world as it is and the world as we want it to be and\nbuild that bridge. And what I always tell my staff, and what I told our negotiators during the Paris Agreement, is better is good. Better is not always enough; better is not always ideal, and in the case of climate change, better is not going to save the planet. But if we get enough better, each year, we're doing something that's making more progress, moving us forward, increasing clean energy, then that's ultimately how we end up solving this problem.\nAnd that's when we can start creating political coalitions that will listen to us, because we're actually recognizing that some people have some real concerns about what this transition is going to do to them, to their pocketbook, and we've got to make sure that they feel like they're being heard in this whole process.\nMs. Hayhoe. Absolutely. I couldn't agree more, first of all. And second of all, I think that this really underscores one of the biggest lessons that I, as a scientist, have learned. So, so often, we feel like facts and information are what's going to make people care.\nAnd so many times, I have somebody come into me and say, Katharine, if you could just talk to my mother, if you could just talk to my brother-in-law, if you could just talk to our city councilperson and give them the facts—it's real, it's us, it's bad, we have to fix it—that will change their minds. The biggest thing I've learned is that facts are not enough. In fact, the more literate we are about science, the more polarized, we are about climate change.\nThe most important thing to do is not to pile up scientific reports until they reach a tottering pile of about 8 feet, where they'll tip over and crush somebody. The most important thing to do is to connect this issue to what's already in our hearts. Because one of the most insidious myths I feel like we've bought into is that I have to be a certain type of person to care about climate change. And if I am not that person, then I don't care about it because I care about these other things. But the reality is, is that if we're a human living on this planet—which most of us are, yes—as long as we haven't signed up for the trip to Mars—I don't want to know if anybody has. I think you're crazy. [Laughter]\nMr. DiCaprio. I did, but I canceled.\nMs. Hayhoe. Oh, you did? Oh, I'm sorry, I take that back. [Laughter]\nThe President. No, no, he is—I think he'll acknowledge he's crazy. [Laughter] That's okay.\nMr. DiCaprio. That's out.\nMs. Hayhoe. All right, we'll go with that. [Laughter] So if we're a human living on this planet, this is the only planet we have. It's our home. If we're a parent, we would do anything for our children's sake. If we're a businessperson, we care about the economy. We care about the community that we live in. We care about our house. We care about the fact that we want to have clean air to breathe; we want to have enough water to drink; we want to have a safe and secure environment in which to live.\nThe single most important thing I feel like I've learned is that we already have all the values we need to care about climate change in our hearts, no matter who we are and what part of the spectrum we come from. We just have to figure out how to connect those values to the issue of climate.\n[Mr. DiCaprio posed several questions, to which Ms. Hayhoe responded. Mr. DiCaprio then continued as follows.]\nClimate Change/Sea Levels/National Security Implications of Climate Change/Energy Efficiency Mr. DiCaprio. I got the opportunity to sit with the head of NASA, and you'll see a lot of this in the film, but he basically projected the next 20 to 30 years. And he started talking about specifically the United States and the possibility of another Dust Bowl coming up. I asked about my home State of California and the wildfires and the droughts that are occurring there. And he said you can expect to continue that.\nMs. Hayhoe. Yes.\nMr. DiCaprio. Do you agree that if we—we're going to feel some of the repercussions of climate change in the form of rising sea levels, more intense hurricanes, and we're going to see droughts and wildfires like that start to occur in the future. How—what do you think the future is going to look like for us if we do not take immediate action? Do you think we'll be able to sustain the projected levels of what's going to happen to our planet for the next 20 years? Or do you think that if we don't take immediate action, things are going to get exponentially worse?\n[Ms. Hayhoe made brief remarks, concluding as follows.]\nMs. Hayhoe. It isn't a single event where we can point at, and we can say, okay, that event was definitely climate change, but that event was a hundred-percent natural. It's more like climate change is taking the natural weather dice—and there's always a chance of rolling a double six, an event that has a huge impact on us, economically—and climate change is sneaking in when we're not looking, and it's taking another one of those numbers and replacing it with a six and then another number and replacing it with a six. So the chances of rolling that double six are increasing the further we go down this road.\nThe President. Now, one thing I'd say, Leo, and I think Katharine alluded to this—another analogy to think about is, we're heading towards a cliff at 90 miles an hour. And if we hit the brakes, we don't come to an immediate stop without spinning out of control. And so what we have to do is, we have to tap the brakes. And if we tap the brakes now, then we don't go over the cliff.\nSo when you think about climate change, there's a big difference between the oceans rising 3 feet or the oceans rising 10 feet. Three feet, it's going to be expensive and inconvenient and disruptive. And we already see that—if you live in Miami right now—and I think, in fact, in your film, you reference this—there are sunny days where, at noon, suddenly, there's 2 feet of water in the middle of the streets. And the reason is because as the oceans and the tides rise, Miami is on pretty porous rock, so it's not even sufficient to build, like, a wall because it's coming up through the ground.\nAnd it's going to be really expensive for Miami with 3 feet of water—or 3 feet of higher ocean. But it's probably manageable. Once you start getting to 10 feet, then you don't have South Florida. There will still be Florida, but it will be the Florida that it looked like maybe a million years ago.\nMs. Hayhoe. Yes.\nThe President. And that's a lot of property value. South Beach and Coral Gables, and there are a lot of really nice spots. [Laughter]\nMy hometown of Hawaii—or Honolulu. Honolulu will still be there, but 3 feet just means you're moving houses a little bit back from the beach. Ten feet means the beach doesn't exist.\nAnd so the ramifications of whether we work on this now, steadily, and make progress or we don't could mean the difference between huge disruptions versus adaptations that are expensive and inconvenient, but that don't fundamentally change the shape of our society or put us into potential conflict.\nNow, I'm using examples here in the United States. Poor countries are obviously much more vulnerable. If you see a change in monsoon patterns in the Indian subcontinent, well, you've got potentially a billion people who are dependent on a certain pattern of rains, the Himalayas getting a certain amount of snowpack, et cetera, and those folks' margin of error is so thin that you might end up seeing migrations of hundreds of millions of people, which invariably will create significant conflict.\nThere's already some really interesting work—not definitive, but powerful—showing that the droughts that happened in Syria contributed to the unrest and the Syrian civil war. Well, if you start magnifying that across a lot of States, a lot of nation States that already contain a lot of poor people who are just right at the margins of survival, this becomes a national security issue.\nAnd that's why, even as we have Members of Congress who scoff at climate change at the same time as they are saluting and wearing flag pins and extolling their patriotism, they're not paying attention to our Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Pentagon who are saying that this is one of the most significant national security threats that we face over the next 50 years.\nAnd all of which is to say that as hard as it is for us to start acting now to solve a problem that has not fully manifested itself yet, this is going to be a really important test for humanity and our political system. And it's a test that requires everybody to do better. It requires me to do better, as somebody who's got a voice. It requires Katharine and scientists to communicate more effectively. Everybody should take a lesson from Katharine on how to explain this stuff in ways that people understand.\nIt requires us reaching out to the faith community in ways that Katharine has done a really good job of, because there are a lot of evangelicals who are actually generally on the conservative side of the spectrum, but care deeply about this planet that God made. It requires us to reach out to sportsmen and hunters and fishermen who may not agree at all on Second Amendment issues, but they sure like and understand the notion that they've got a forest where they can go out and—although they probably don't want to be mauled by a grizzly bear—[laughter]—that looks a little severe. [Laughter]\nSo all of us I think are going to have to do better than we're doing in elevating this issue. And as I said before, better is good. We can start with existing technologies. I'll just use one last example on this.\nIf we just had the energy efficiency of Japan, which is an island nation that doesn't have a lot of fossil fuels, and so, historically, in their development path have been much more conscious about energy efficiency, we could reduce our energy consumption by 20 percent without changing our standard of living. Simple stuff like when you leave a room the light automatically goes off instead of its still being on.\nA lot of companies are doing some smart work because it affects their bottom line. Our ability to measure in houses sort of smartly how much energy we're using and minimizing waste of energy and heat can make a huge difference. Folks in Texas, you need—air conditioning is a great invention, but nothing gets me more frustrated than seeing somebody, and it's 100 degrees outside, and they're wearing a sweater indoors because the air conditioning is turned up too high.\nMs. Hayhoe. Yes, yes. The President. But we do that everywhere—partly because of building design. You can't open the windows, and so, as a consequence, you can't use natural temperature regulators.\nThere's a bunch of stuff that seems kind of simple and stupid, but would make a big dent. All those things have to start getting factored in. But we've got to change our politics. And as Leo said, it's got to come from the bottom up. Until on a bipartisan basis, politicians feel that their failure to address this will cost them their seats, potentially, or will threaten their careers, then they're going to continue to operate in ways that I think are really unproductive.\nMs. Hayhoe. Yes. I began to study climate science over 20 years ago, and I have lived through the period where climate change has become one of the most politicized issues in the entire United States to where the number-one predictor of what our opinions are about climate change is nothing more than where we fall on the political spectrum.\nThe reality is, as my husband says, who is an evangelical pastor, a thermometer is not Democrat or Republican. It does not give us different numbers depending on how we vote. The science is what it is. If we say gravity isn't real, and we step off the cliff, we're going down anyways. But the solutions are political. Do we go with a cap-and-trade? Do we go with a carbon tax? Do we go with technological incentivizes? What do we do about other countries? How do we build States and businesses and communities? These are political, and they should be debated up and down the halls. But what should not be debated is the fact that we are all human, we share this amazing home that we live in, and it is in all of our best interests to make sure that we leave it a better place for our children.\nThe President. Good.\nEnvironmental Conservation/Air Pollution/China\nMr. DiCaprio. This is my last question. President Obama, you used the Antiquities Act to preserve more acres of land and sea than any President since Teddy Roosevelt. [Applause] I was going to say, let's give him a round of applause, but they did that automatically. The great Teddy Roosevelt. How important is it to have a President who not only believes in the science of climate change—[laughter]—but one who understands that we must conserve these natural resources to create conditions that are conducive to a sustainable life for future generations?\nThe President. Well, this goes to the point Katharine made about values. And I mentioned I grew up in Hawaii. Those of you who have been there, it's a really pretty place. And the native Hawaiian traditions are so woven with nature and the sea and outdoors, and so that seeps into you when you grow up there.\nBut I tell you, I don't know any place in the country where there isn't someplace that evokes the same kind of sense of place and beauty. It may be a desert landscape. It may be a forest somewhere. It may be a mountain. And as my girls start getting older, I start thinking about grandkids—not soon. [Laughter] But it's natural, you start thinking about sort of the next stages of your life and the idea that my grandkids wouldn't see something I had seen, that—you can be a conservative Republican in Alabama, but you've got a memory of your dad taking you out hunting, and you being quiet and still, and you want to do that same thing with your kid. And it may be different than me taking my grandkid bodysurfing at Sandy Beach, but there's the same feeling of wanting to pass that on, of feeling deeply about it and caring deeply about it.\nAnd I think one of the ways for us to tackle the climate change issue is also to lift up the power and the values that are embodied in conservation. It's kind of a twofer. When we went out to Midway Island, which is already a historic site because in part this was the turning point of World War II. There are people who revere this site because of its history in World War II and the incredible courage and bravery of people who were outnumbered, but ultimately were able to turn back the—a Japanese fleet that was on its way to Hawaii.\nBut we were up there, and this is water that's just untouched. And you're seeing monk seals diving in and swimming next to you, and turtles that are climbing up on the beach just to sun themselves, and it used to be there were 60,000 birds, and now there are 3 million birds on this island—bunch of species that were about to go extinct. It all came back just in the span of one generation because of conservation. Well, not only is that creating incredible beauty, but it also means now that you have this huge preserve of ocean that is not contributing to climate change.\nAnd so I think these two things go hand in hand. In the same way that the issue of air pollution and disease is, in some ways, a way to get at the climate change issue if people aren't directly concerned about climate change. In China, frankly, part of the reason that people are—that the government there was willing to work with us, they're number-one priority is political stability. And what they started noticing was the number-one Twitter feed in China was the air quality monitor that was put out each morning by the U.S. Embassy. It was the single thing that more Chinese looked at than anything because people couldn't breathe in Beijing.\nAnd smog is not the same as carbon dioxide, but it is generated by the same energy pattern usages. So if that's people—if that's where people are at right now and they want to be sure their kids are healthy, then let's go after that. If they're interested in conservation as a way to start thinking about climate change, let's go after that. There are so many entry points into this issue, and we've got to use all of them in order to convince people that this is something worth caring about.\nBut at the end of the day, the one thing I'm absolutely convinced about is, everybody cares about their kids, their grandkids, and the kind of world we pass on to them. And if we can speak to them about our responsibilities to the next generation, and we can give people realistic ways to deal with this so that they don't feel like they've got to sacrifice this generation to do it, they have to put hardship on their kids now in order to save their grandkids—then I tend to be a cautious optimist about our ability to make change. But events like this obviously make a big difference and really help.\nMs. Hayhoe. Yes.\nMr. DiCaprio. Mr. President, Katharine, thank you so much for your time. I'm truly honored to premier this film here on the White House lawn. This—like I said, this was a 3-year endeavor. I learned so much and I'm going to let the film speak for itself as far as everything that I experience on this journey.\nThank you so much for your time. Let's give them a round of applause. Thank you.\nThe President. Thank you, everybody. Appreciate you. Thank you.\nMr. DiCaprio. Thank you all for showing up.\nThe President. Have fun, everybody.\nMr. DiCaprio. Enjoy the film.", "timestamp": "2016-10-03", "title": "Remarks During a Panel Discussion on Climate Change at the White House South by South Lawn Festival"}

From Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia, and welcome to the first, and only, vice presidential debate of 2016, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.\nI'm Elaine Quijano, anchor at CBSN, and correspondent for CBS News. It's an honor to moderate this debate between Senator Tim Kaine and Governor Mike Pence. Both are longtime public servants who are also proud fathers of sons serving in the U.S. Marines.\nThe campaigns have agreed to the rules of this 90-minute debate. There will be nine different segments covering domestic and foreign policy issues. Each segment will begin with a question to both candidates who will each have two minutes to answer. Then I'll ask follow-up questions to facilitate a discussion between the candidates. By coin toss, it's been determined that Senator Kaine will be first to answer the opening question.\nWe have an enthusiastic audience tonight. They've agreed to only express that enthusiasm once at the end of the debate and right now as we welcome Governor Mike Pence and Senator Tim Kaine. [applause]\nGentlemen, welcome. It truly is a privilege to be with both of you tonight.\nI'd like to start with the topic of presidential leadership. Twenty-eight years ago tomorrow night, Lloyd Bentsen said the vice presidential debate was not about the qualifications for the vice presidency, but about how if tragedy should occur, the vice president has to step in without any margin for error, without time for preparation, to take over the responsibility for the biggest job in the world.\nWhat about your qualities, your skills, and your temperament equip you to step into that role at a moment's notice? Senator Kaine?\nKAINE: Elaine, thank you for being here tonight, and, Governor Pence, welcome. It is so great to be back at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia.\nThis is a very special place. Sixty-five years ago, a young, courageous woman, Barbara Johns, led a walkout of her high school, Moton High School. She made history by protesting school segregation. She believed our nation was stronger together. And that walkout led to the Brown v. Board of Education decision that moved us down the path toward equality.\nI am so proud to be running with another strong, history-making woman, Hillary Clinton, to be president of the United States. I'm proud because her vision of stronger together, building an economy that works for all, not just those at the top, being safe in the world not only with a strong military, but also strong alliances to battle terrorism and climate change, and also to build a community of respect, just like Barbara Johns tried to do 65 years ago. That's why I'm so proud to be her running mate.\nHillary told me why she asked me to be her running mate. She said the test of a Clinton administration will not be the signing of a bill or the passage of a bill. It'll be whether we can make somebody's life better, whether we can make a classroom better learning environment for schoolkids or teachers, whether we can make a safer — it's going to be about results.\nAnd she said to me, you've been a missionary and a civil rights lawyer. You've been a city councilman and mayor. You've been a lieutenant governor and governor and now a U.S. senator. I think you will help me figure out how to govern this nation so that we always keep in mind that the success of the administration is the difference we make in people's lives.\nAnd that's what I bring to the ticket, that experience having served at all levels of government. But my primary role is to be Hillary Clinton's right-hand person and strong supporter as she puts together the most historic administration possible. And I relish that role. I'm so proud of her.\nI'll just say this: We trust Hillary Clinton, my wife and I, and we trust her with the most important thing in our life. We have a son deployed overseas in the Marine Corps right now. We trust Hillary Clinton as president and commander-in-chief, but the thought of Donald Trump as commander-in-chief scares us to death.\nQUIJANO: Governor Pence?\nPENCE: Well, first off, thank you, Elaine, and thank you to — thank you to Norwood University for their wonderful hospitality and the Commission on Presidential Debates. It's deeply humbling for me to be here, to be surrounded by my — my wonderful family.\nAnd, Senator Kaine, it's an honor to be here with you, as well. And I just — I also want to say — I want to say thanks to everyone that's looking in tonight, who understands what an enormously important time this is in the life of our nation.\nFor the last seven-and-a-half years, we've seen America's place in the world weakened. We've seen an economy stifled by more taxes, more regulation, a war on coal, and a failing health care reform come to be known as Obamacare, and the American people know that we need to make a change. And so I want to thank all of you for being — being with us tonight.\nI also want to thank Donald Trump for making that call and inviting us to be a part of this ticket. I have to tell you, I'm a — I'm a small-town boy from a place not too different from Farmville. I grew up with a cornfield in my backyard. My grandfather had immigrated to this country when he was about my son's age. My mom and dad built a — everything that matters in a small town in Southern Indiana. They built a family and — and a good name and a business. And they raised a family. And I dreamed some day of representing my home town in Washington, D.C., but I — honestly, Elaine, I never imagined — never imagined I'd have the opportunity to be governor of the state that I love, let alone be sitting at a table like this in this kind of a position.\nSo to answer your question, I would say I — I would hope that if — if the responsibility ever fell to me in this role, that I would meet it with the way that I'm going to meet the responsibility should I be elected vice president of the United States. And that's to bring a lifetime of experience, a lifetime growing up in a small town, a lifetime where I've served in the Congress of the United States, where — where I've led a state that works in the great state of Indiana, and whatever other responsibilities might follow from this, I — I would hope and, frankly, I would pray to be able to meet that moment with that — that lifetime of experience.\nQUIJANO: Senator Kaine, on the campaign trail, you praised Secretary Clinton's character, including her commitment to public service, yet 60 percent of voters don't think she's trustworthy. Why do so many people distrust her? Is it because they have questions about her e-mails and the Clinton Foundation?\nKAINE: Elaine, let me tell you why I trust Hillary Clinton. Here's what people should look at as they look at a public servant. Do they have a passion in their life that showed up before they were in public life? And have they held onto that passion throughout their life, regardless of whether they were in office or not, succeeding or failing?\nHillary Clinton has that passion. From a time as a kid in a Methodist youth group in the suburbs of Chicago, she has been focused on serving others with a special focus on empowering families and kids. As a civil rights lawyer in the South, with the Children's Defense Fund, first lady of Arkansas and this country, senator, secretary of state, it's always been about putting others first. And that's a sharp contrast with Donald Trump.\nDonald Trump always puts himself first. He built a business career, in the words of one of his own campaign staffers, \"off the backs of the little guy.\" And as a candidate, he started his campaign with a speech where he called Mexicans rapists and criminals, and he has pursued the discredited and really outrageous lie that President Obama wasn't born in the United States.\nIt is so painful to suggest that we go back to think about these days where an African-American could not be a citizen of the United States. And I can't imagine how Governor Pence can defend the insult- driven selfish \"me first\" style of Donald Trump.\nQUIJANO: Governor Pence, let me ask you, you have said Donald Trump is, quote, \"thoughtful, compassionate, and steady.\" Yet 67 percent of voters feel he is a risky choice, and 65 percent feel he does not have the right kind of temperament to be president. Why do so many Americans think Mr. Trump is simply too erratic?\nPENCE: Well, let me — let me say first and foremost that, Senator, you and Hillary Clinton would know a lot about an insult- driven campaign. It really is remarkable. At a time when literally, in the wake of Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, where she was the architect of the Obama administration's foreign policy, we see entire portions of the world, particularly the wider Middle East, literally spinning out of control. I mean, the situation we're watching hour by hour in Syria today is the result of the failed foreign policy and the weak foreign policy that Hillary Clinton helped lead in this administration and create. The newly emboldened — the aggression of Russia, whether it was in Ukraine or now they're heavy-handed approach...\nKAINE: You guys love Russia. You both have said...\nPENCE: ... their heavy-handed approach.\nKAINE: You both have said — you both have said Vladimir Putin is a better leader than the president.\nPENCE: Well...[crosstalk]\nQUIJANO: Well, we're going to get to Russia in just a moment. But I do want to get back to the question at...\nPENCE: But in the midst — Elaine, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Senator, I'll...\nKAINE: These guys have praised Vladimir Putin as a great leader. How can that...[crosstalk]\nQUIJANO: Yes, and we will get to that, Senator. We do have that coming up here. But in the meantime, the questions...\nPENCE: Well, Senator, I must have hit a...[crosstalk]...I must have hit a nerve here.\nQUIJANO: Why the disconnect?\nPENCE: Because at a time of great challenge in the life of this nation, where we've weakened America's place in the world, stifled America's economy, the campaign of Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine has been an avalanche of insults.\nLook, to get to your question about trustworthiness, Donald Trump has built a business through hard times and through good times. He's brought an extraordinary business acumen. He's employed tens of thousands of people in this country.\nKAINE: And paid few taxes and lost a billion a year.\n[crosstalk]\nQUIJANO: And why the disconnect with your running mate?\nPENCE: But there's a — there's a reason why people question the trustworthiness of Hillary Clinton. And that's because they're paying attention. I mean, the reality is, when she was secretary of state, Senator, come on. She had a Clinton Foundation accepting contributions from foreign governments.\nKAINE: You are Donald Trump's apprentice. Let me talk about this...[crosstalk]\nPENCE: Senator, I think I'm still on my time.\nKAINE: Well, I think — isn't this a discussion?\nQUIJANO: This is our open discussion.\nKAINE: Yeah, let's talk about the state of...[crosstalk]\nPENCE: Well, let me interrupt — let me interrupt you and finish my sentence, if I can.\nKAINE: Finish your sentence.\nPENCE: The Clinton Foundation accepted foreign contributions from foreign governments and foreign donors while she was secretary of state.\nKAINE: OK, now I can weigh in. Now...\nPENCE: She had a private server...\nKAINE: Now, I get to weigh in. Now, let me just say this...\nPENCE: ... that was discovered...[crosstalk]\nQUIJANO: ... Senator, you have an opportunity to respond.\nPENCE: ... keep that pay to play process out of the reach of the public.\nKAINE: Governor Pence — Governor Pence doesn't think the world's going so well and he, you know, is going to say it's everybody's fault.\nPENCE: Do you?\nKAINE: Let me tell you this. When Hillary Clinton became secretary of state, Governor Pence, did you know that Osama bin Laden was alive?\nPENCE: Yes.\nKAINE: Do you know that we had 175,000 troops deployed in the battlefield in Iraq and Afghanistan? Do you know that Iran was racing toward a nuclear weapon and Russia was expanding its stockpile?\nUnder Secretary Clinton's leadership, she was part of the national team, public safety team that went after and revived the dormant hunt against bin Laden and wiped him off the face of the Earth. She worked to deal with the Russians to reduce their chemical weapons stockpile. She worked a tough negotiation with nations around the world to eliminate the Iranian nuclear weapons program without firing a shot.\nPENCE: Eliminate the Iranian nuclear weapons program?\nKAINE: Absolutely, without firing a shot. And instead of 175,000 American troops deployed overseas, we now have 15,000.\nPENCE: Right and...\nKAINE: These are very, very good things.\nPENCE: And Iraq has been overrun by ISIS, because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate...\nKAINE: Well, if you want to put more American troops in Iraq, you can propose that.\nPENCE: Hillary Clinton — Hillary Clinton — Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement...\nKAINE: No, that is incorrect. That's incorrect.\nPENCE: And so we removed — we removed all of our...\nQUIJANO: Gentlemen, we'll get to...[crosstalk]\nPENCE: ... troops from Iraq, and ISIS was able to be conjured up in that vacuum.\nKAINE: But I'd like to correct...\nPENCE: ... and overrun vast areas of Iraq.\nKAINE: Governor, President Bush said we would leave Iraq at the end of 2011. And, Elaine, Iraq didn't want our troops to stay, and they wouldn't give us the protection for our troops. And guess what? If a nation where our troops are serving does not want us to stay, we're not going to stay without their protection.\nPENCE: It was a failure of the secretary of state...\nQUIJANO: We need to move on to the next topic, gentlemen.\nKAINE: If Governor Pence wants to put more troops back in Iraq, that's...\nQUIJANO: There are a lot of people wondering in this country about the economy. Let's turn to the issue of the economy.\nKAINE: OK.\nQUIJANO: According to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, neither of your economic plans will reduce the growing $19 trillion gross national debt. In fact, your plans would add even more to it.\nBoth of you were governors who balanced state budgets. Are you concerned that adding more to the debt could be disastrous for the country. Governor Pence?\nPENCE: I think the fact that — that under this past administration was of which Hillary Clinton was a part, we've almost doubled the national debt is atrocious. I mean, I'm very proud of the fact that — I come from a state that works. The state of Indiana has balanced budgets. We cut taxes, we've made record investments in education and in infrastructure, and I still finish my term with $2 billion in the bank.\nThat's a little bit different than when Senator Kaine was governor here in Virginia. He actually — he actually tried to raise taxes by about $4 billion. He left his state about $2 billion in the hole. In the state of Indiana, we've cut unemployment in half; unemployment doubled when he was governor.\nBut I think he's a very fitting running mate for Hillary Clinton, because in the wake of a season where American families are struggling in this economy under the weight of higher taxes and Obamacare and the war on coal and the stifling avalanche of regulation coming out of this administration, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want more of the same. It really is remarkable that they actually are advocating a trillion dollars in tax increases, which I get that. You tried to raise taxes here in Virginia and were unsuccessful.\nBut a trillion dollars in tax increases, more regulation, more of the same war on coal, and more of Obamacare that now even former President Bill Clinton calls Obamacare a crazy plan. But Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to build on Obamacare. They want to expand it into a single-payer program. And for all the world, Hillary Clinton just thinks Obamacare is a good start.\nLook, Donald Trump and I have a plan to get this economy moving again just the way that it worked in the 1980s, just the way it worked in the 1960s, and that is by lowering taxes across the board for working families, small businesses and family farms, ending the war on coal that is hurting jobs and hurting this economy even here in Virginia, repealing Obamacare lock, stock, and barrel, and repealing all of the executive orders that Barack Obama has signed that are stifling economic growth in this economy.\nWe can get America moving again. Put on top of that the kind of trade deals that'll put the American worker first, and you've got a prescription for real growth. And when you get the economy growing, Elaine, that's when you can deal with the national debt. When we get back to 3.5 percent to 4 percent growth with Donald Trump's plan will do, then we're going to have the resources to meet our nation's needs at home and abroad, and we're going to have the ability to bring down the national debt.\nQUIJANO: Senator Kaine?\nKAINE: Elaine, on the economy, there's a fundamental choice for the American electorate. Do you want a \"you're hired\" president in Hillary Clinton or do you want a \"you're fired\" president in Donald Trump? I think that's not such a hard choice.\nHillary and I have a plan that's on the table that's a \"you're hired\" plan. Five components. First thing we do is we invest in manufacturing, infrastructure, and research in the clean energy jobs of tomorrow. Second thing is we invest in our workforce, from pre-K education to great teachers to debt-free college and tuition-free college for families that make less than $125,000 a year.\nThird, we promote fairness by raising the minimum wage, so you can't work full-time and be under the poverty level, and by paying women equal pay for equal work.\nFourth, we promote small business growth, just as we've done in Virginia, to make it easier to start and grow small businesses. Hillary and I each grew up in small-business families. My dad, who ran an iron working and welding shop, is here tonight.\nAnd, fifth, we have a tax plan that targets tax relief to middle- class individuals and small businesses and asks those at the very top who've benefited as we've come out of recession to pay more.\nThe Trump plan is a different plan. It's a \"you're fired\" plan. And there's two key elements to it. First, Donald Trump said wages are too high. And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage.\nMike Pence, when he was in Congress, voted against raising the minimum wage above $5.15. And he has been a one-man bulwark against minimum wage increases in Indiana.\nThe second component of the plan is massive tax breaks for the very top, trillions of dollars of tax breaks for people just like Donald Trump. The problem with this, Elaine, is that's exactly what we did 10 years ago and it put the economy into the deepest recession — the deepest recession since the 1930s.\nIndependent analysts say the Clinton plan would grow the economy by 10.5 million jobs. The Trump plan would cost 3.5 million jobs. And Donald Trump — why would he do this? Because his tax plan basically helps him. And if he ever met his promise and he gave his tax returns to the American public like he said he would, we would see just how much his economic plan is really a Trump-first plan.\nQUIJANO: On that point, Governor Pence, recently the New York Times released part of Mr. Trump's 1995 tax return and reported that he could have avoided paying federal income taxes for years. Yesterday, Mr. Trump said he brilliantly used the laws to pay as little tax as legally possible. Does that seem fair to you?\nPENCE: Well, first, let me say, I appreciated the \"you're hired,\" \"you're fired\" thing, Senator. You use that a whole lot. And I think your running mate used a lot of pre-done lines.\nLook, what — what you all just heard out there is more taxes, $2 trillion in more spending, more deficits, more debt, more government. And if you think that's all working, then you look at the other side of the table. I mean, the truth of the matter is, the policies of this administration, which Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine want to continue, have run this economy into a ditch. We're in the...\nKAINE: Fifteen million new jobs?\nPENCE: ... slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression.\nKAINE: Fifteen million new jobs?\nQUIJANO: Governor...[crosstalk]\nPENCE: There are millions more people living in poverty today than the day that Barack Obama with Hillary Clinton at his side...\nKAINE: And the poverty level and the median income...\nPENCE: ... stepped into the Oval Office.\nKAINE: ... improved dramatically between 2014 and 2015.\nPENCE: You — honestly, Senator, you can roll out the numbers and the sunny side, but I got to tell you, people in Scranton know different. People in Fort Wayne, Indiana, know different. I mean, this economy is struggling. The answer to this economy is not more taxes.\nKAINE: But it's not the giveaway tax relief to the folks at the top.\nPENCE: It's not more spending...[crosstalk]\nKAINE: I am interested to hear whether he'll defend his running mate's not releasing taxes and not paying taxes.\nPENCE: Absolutely I will.\nQUIJANO: Governor, with all due respect, the question was about whether it seems fair to you that Mr. Trump said he brilliantly used the laws to pay as little tax as legally possible.\nPENCE: Well, this is probably the difference between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine. And, I mean, Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine — God bless you for it, career public servants, that's great — Donald Trump is a businessman, not a career politician. He actually built a business.\nThose tax returns that were — that came out publicly this week show that he faced some pretty tough times 20 years ago. But like virtually every other business, including the New York Times not too long ago, he used what's called net operating loss. We have a tax code, Senator, that actually is designed to encourage entrepreneurship in this country.\nKAINE: But why won't he release his tax returns?\nPENCE: Well, we're answering the question about — about a business thing, is he...\nKAINE: I do want to come back to that, but...\nPENCE: His tax returns — his tax returns showed he went through a very difficult time, but he used the tax code just the way it's supposed to be used. And he did it brilliantly.\nKAINE: How do you know that? You haven't seen his tax returns.\nPENCE: He created a runway — because he's created a business that's worth billions of dollars today.\nKAINE: How do you know that?\nPENCE: And with regard to paying taxes, this whole riff about not paying taxes and people saying he didn't pay taxes for years, Donald Trump has created tens of thousands of jobs. And he's paid payroll taxes, sales taxes, property taxes...\nKAINE: Elaine, let me talk about something.\nQUIJANO: Senator, I'm going to give you about 30 seconds to respond, and I have question on Social Security for you.\nKAINE: OK.\nPENCE: The only issue on taxes — Hillary Clinton is going to raise taxes, and Donald Trump and I are going to cut them.\nKAINE: Donald Trump started this campaign in 2014 and he said, \"If I run for president, I will absolutely release my taxes.\" He's broken his first...\nPENCE: And he will.\nKAINE: He's broken his first promise. Second, he stood on the stage...\nPENCE: He hasn't broken his promise. He said he's...\nKAINE: He stood on the stage last week and when Hillary said, you haven't been paying taxes, he said, \"That makes me smart.\" So it's smart not to pay for our military? It's smart not to pay for veterans? It's smart not to pay for teachers? And I guess all of us who do pay for those things, I guess we're stupid. And the last thing I'll say is this...\nPENCE: Senator, do you take all the deductions that you're entitled to?\nKAINE: The last thing — the last thing I want to ask Governor Pence is...\nPENCE: I do.\nKAINE: Governor Pence had to give Donald Trump his tax returns to show he was qualified to be vice president. Donald Trump must give the American public his tax returns to show that he's qualified to be president. And he's breaking his promise.\nPENCE: Elaine, I have to respond to this.\nQUIJANO: You get very little time, 20 seconds.\nPENCE: I'll be — I'll be very respectful.\nQUIJANO: Governor?\nPENCE: Look, Donald Trump has filed over 100 pages of financial disclosure, which is what the law requires.\nKAINE: But he said he would release his tax returns.\nQUIJANO: All right, Gentlemen...\nPENCE: The American people can review that. And he's going — Senator, he's going to release his tax returns when the audit is over...\nQUIJANO: ... I need to ask you about Social Security...\nKAINE: Richard Nixon released tax returns when he was under audit.\nPENCE: They're going to raise your taxes. We're going to cut your taxes.\nQUIJANO: Gentlemen...\nKAINE: If you can't meet Nixon's standard...\nQUIJANO: The people at home cannot understand either one of you when you speak over each other. I would please ask you to wait until it is that the other is finished.\nKAINE: All right. We're having fun up here.\nQUIJANO: Senator Kaine, on the issue of Social Security, in 18 years, when the Social Security Trust Funds run out of money, you'll be 76. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates your benefits could be cut by as much as $7,500 per year. What would your administration do to prevent this cut?\nKAINE: First, we're going to protect Social Security, which is one of the greatest programs that the American government has ever done. It happened at a time when you would work your whole life, your whole life, raising your kids, working, being a Little League coach or a Sunday school teacher, and then you would retire into poverty. And Social Security has enabled people to retire with dignity and overwhelmingly not be in poverty.\nWe have to keep it solvent. And we will keep it solvent. And we'll look for strategies like adjusting the payroll tax cap upward in order to do that.\nHere's what Hillary and I will not do. And I want to make this very plain. We will never, ever engage in a risky scheme to privatize Social Security. Donald Trump wrote a book and he said Social Security is a Ponzi scheme and privatization would be good for all of us.\nAnd when Congressman Pence was in Congress, he was the chief cheerleader for the privatization of Social Security. Even after President Bush stopped pushing for it, Congressman Pence kept pushing for it. We're going to stand up against efforts to privatize Social Security. And we'll look for ways to keep it solvent going forward, focusing primarily on the payroll tax cap.\nQUIJANO: Governor Pence, I'll give you an opportunity to respond.\nPENCE: Well, thanks, Elaine. There they go again. OK...\nKAINE: Go read — go read the book.\nPENCE: All Donald Trump — all Donald Trump and I have said about Social Security is we're going to meet our obligations to our seniors. That's it.\nKAINE: Go read the book.\nPENCE: We've said we're going to meet the obligations of Medicare. That's what this campaign is really about, Senator. And I get, this is — this is the old scare tactic that they roll out...\nKAINE: But — but you have a voting record, Governor.\nPENCE: And I get all of that. I just, look...\nKAINE: I...\nPENCE: There's a question that you asked a little bit earlier that I want to go back to.\nKAINE: I can't believe that you won't defend your own voting record.\nPENCE: I have to go back to.\nQUIJANO: We...\nPENCE: Well, look, I — you're running with Hillary Clinton, who wants to raise taxes by $1 trillion, increase spending by $2 trillion, and you say you're going to keep the promises of Social Security. Donald Trump and I are going to cut taxes. We're going to — we're going to — we're going to...\nKAINE: You're not going to cut taxes. You're going to raise taxes on the middle class.\nPENCE: ... reform government programs so we can meet the obligations of Social Security and Medicare.\nQUIJANO: All right. PENCE: Stay on the path that your party has us on, we're going to be in a — in a mountain range of debt. And we're going to face hard choices and...[crosstalk]\nGentleman, I want to move on now.\nKAINE: You did ask this question about debt, and the debt explosion on the Trump plan is much, much bigger than anything on the Clinton side.\nQUIJANO: All right. Let me move on now...\nPENCE: Three hundred and five economists said your plan is bad for the economy.\nQUIJANO: ... to the issue of law enforcement and race relations. Law enforcement and race relations. After the Dallas police shooting, Police Chief David Brown said, quote, \"We're asking cops to do too much in this country. Every societal failure we put it off on the cops to solve. Not enough mental health funding, not enough drug addiction funding, schools fail, let's give it to the cops.\"\nDo we ask too much of police officers in this country? And how would you specifically address the chief's concerns? Senator Kaine?\nKAINE: Elaine, I think that's a very fair comment. I think we put a lot on police shoulders. And this is something I got a lot of scar tissue and experience on.\nI was a city councilman and mayor in Richmond. And when I came in, we had one of the highest homicide rates in the United States. We fought very, very hard over the course of my time in local office with our police department, and we reduced our homicide rate nearly in half.\nAnd then when I was governor of Virginia, we worked hard, too. And we did something we had really wanted to do. For the first time ever, we cracked the top 10, 10 safest states, because we worked together.\nHere's what I learned as a mayor and a governor. The way you make communities safer and the way you make police safer is through community policing. You build the bonds between the community and the police force, build bonds of understanding, and then when people feel comfortable in their communities, that gap between the police and the communities they serve narrows. And when that gap narrows, it's safer for the communities and it's safer for the police.\nThat model still works across our country, but there are some other models that don't work, an overly aggressive, more militarized model. Donald Trump recently said we need to do more stop-and-frisk around the country. That would be a big mistake because it polarizes the relationship between the police and the community.\nSo here's what we'll do. We'll focus on community policing. We will focus on — and Hillary Clinton has rolled out a really comprehensive mental health reform package that she worked on with law enforcement professionals, and we will also fight the scourge of gun violence in the United States.\nI'm a gun-owner. I'm a strong Second Amendment supporter. But I've got a lot of scar tissue, because when I was governor of Virginia, there was a horrible shooting at Virginia Tech, and we learned that through that painful situation that gaps in the background record check system should have been closed and it could have prevented that crime, and so we're going to work to do things like close background record checks. And if we do, we won't have the tragedies that we did.\nOne of those killed at Virginia Tech was a guy named Liviu Librescu. He was a 70-plus-year-old Romanian Holocaust survivor. He had survived the Holocaust. Then he survived the Soviet Union takeover of his country. But then he was a visiting professor at Virginia Tech, and he couldn't survive the scourge of gun violence.\nWe can support the Second Amendment and do things like background record checks and make us safer, and that will make police safer, too.\nQUIJANO: Governor Pence?\nPENCE: You know, my uncle was a cop, a career cop, on the beat in downtown Chicago. He was my hero when I was growing up. And we'd go up to visit my dad's family in Chicago. My three brothers and I would marvel at my uncle when he would come out in his uniform, sidearm at his side.\nPolice officers are the best of us. And the men and women, white, African-American, Asian, Latino, Hispanic, they put their lives on the line every single day. And let my say, at the risk of agreeing with you, community policing is a great idea. It's worked in the Hoosier state. And we fully support that.\nDonald Trump and I are going to make sure that law enforcement have the resources and the tools to be able to really restore law and order to the cities and communities in this nation. It's probably — probably why the 330,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police endorsed Donald Trump as the next president of the United States of America, because they see his commitment to them. They see his commitment to law and order.\nBut they also — they also hear the bad mouthing, the bad mouthing that comes from people that seize upon tragedy in the wake of police action shootings as — as a reason to — to use a broad brush to accuse law enforcement of — of implicit bias or institutional racism. And that really has got to stop.\nI mean, when an African-American police officer in Charlotte named Brentley Vinson, an all-star football player who went to Liberty University here in the state, came home, followed his dad into law enforcement, joined the force in Charlotte, joined the force in Charlotte in 2014, was involved in a police action shooting that claimed the life of Keith — Keith Lamont Scott, it was a tragedy. I mean, I — we — we mourn with those who mourn. We — we grieve with those who grieve. And we're saddened at the loss of life.\nBut Hillary Clinton actually referred to that moment as an example of implicit bias in the police force, where — where she used — when she was asked in the debate a week ago whether there was implicit bias in law enforcement, her only answer was that there's implicit bias in everyone in the United States. I just think...\nKAINE: Can I — can I explain...\nPENCE: ... I just think what we ought to do is we ought to stop seizing on these moments of tragedy. We ought to assure the public that we'll have a full and complete and transparent investigation whenever there's a loss of life because of police action. But, Senator, please, you know, enough of this seeking every opportunity to demean law enforcement broadly by making the accusation of implicit bias every time tragedy occurs.\nKAINE: Elaine — Elaine, people shouldn't be afraid to bring up issues of bias in law enforcement. And if you're afraid to have...\nPENCE: I'm not afraid to bring that up.\nKAINE: And if — if you're afraid to have the discussion, you'll never solve it. And so here's — here's an example, heartbreaking. We would agree this was a heartbreaking example.\nThe guy, Philando Castile, who was killed in St. Paul, he was a worker, a valued worker in a local school. And he was killed for no apparent reason in an incident that will be discussed and will be investigated.\nBut when folks went and explored this situation, what they found is that Philando Castile, who was a — they called him Mr. Rogers with Dreadlocks in the school that he worked. The kids loved him. But he had been stopped by police 40 or 50 times before that fatal incident. And if you look at sentencing in this country, African-Americans and Latinos get sentenced for the same crimes at very different rates.\nPENCE: We need criminal justice reform.\nKAINE: Well, we do.\nPENCE: Indiana has passed criminal justice reform.\nKAINE: But I just want to say, those who say that we should not...\nPENCE: But that's not what you're talking about.\nKAINE: ... we should not be able to bring up and talk about bias in the system, we'll never solve the problem...\nQUIJANO: Governor Pence...[crosstalk]...Governor Pence...\nPENCE: Senator, when African-American police officers involved in a police action shooting involving an African-American, why would Hillary Clinton accuse that African-American police officer of implicit bias?\nKAINE: Well, I guess I can't believe you are defending the position that there is no bias and it's a topic we don't even...[crosstalk]\nQUIJANO: Governor Pence, I have a question on that point.\nPENCE: I did not make that statement. I...\nQUIJANO: Your fellow Republican, Governor Pence, Senator Tim Scott, who is African-American, recently spoke on the Senate floor. He said he was stopped seven times by law enforcement in one year.\nKAINE: A U.S. senator.\nQUIJANO: He said, \"I have felt the anger, the frustration, the sadness, and the humiliation that comes with feeling like you're being targeted for nothing more than being just yourself.\" What would you say to Senator Scott about his experiences?\nPENCE: Well, I have the deepest respect for Senator Scott, and he's a close friend. And what I would say is that we — we need to adopt criminal justice reform nationally. I — I signed criminal justice reform in the state of Indiana, Senator, and we're very proud of it.\nI worked when I was Congress on a second chance act. We have got to do a better job recognizing and correcting the errors in the system that do reflect on institutional bias in criminal justice. But what — what — what Donald Trump and I are saying is let's not have the reflex of assuming the worst of men and women in law enforcement. We truly do believe that law enforcement is not a force for racism or division in our country...\nKAINE: Elaine, can I...\nQUIJANO: So what would you say to Senator Scott, Governor?\nPENCE: Law enforcement in this country is a force for good. They are the — they truly are people that put their lives on the line every single day. But I would — I would suggest to you, what we need to do is assert a stronger leadership at the national level to support law enforcement. You just heard Senator Kaine reject stop-and-frisk. Well, I would suggest to you that the families that live in our inner cities that are besieged by crime...\nKAINE: Elaine, let me — let me...\nQUIJANO: Governor, the question is about Senator Scott. What would — what would you tell Senator Scott?\nKAINE: Elaine, if I could — if I could jump in. I've heard Senator Scott make that eloquent plea. And look, criminal justice is about respecting the law and being respected by the law. So there is a fundamental respect issue here.\nAnd I just want to talk about the tone that's set from the top. Donald Trump during his campaign has called Mexicans rapists and criminals. He's called women slobs, pigs, dogs, disgusting. I don't like saying that in front of my wife and my mother. He attacked an Indiana-born federal judge and said he was unqualified to hear a federal lawsuit because his parents were Mexican. He went after John McCain, a POW, and said he wasn't hero because he'd been captured. He said African-Americans are living in Hell. And he perpetrated this outrageous and bigoted lie that President Obama is not a U.S. citizen.\nIf you want to have a society where people are respected and respect laws, you can't have somebody at the top who demeans every group that he talks about. And I just — again, I cannot believe that Governor Pence will defend the insult-driven campaign that Donald Trump has run.\nQUIJANO: All right. I want to turn to our next segment now, immigration. Your running mates have both said that undocumented immigrants who have committed violent crimes should be deported. What would you tell the millions of undocumented immigrants who have not committed violent crimes? Governor Pence?\nPENCE: Donald Trump's laid out a plan to end illegal immigration once and for all in this country. We've been talking it to death for 20 years. Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to continue the policies of open borders, amnesty, catch and release, sanctuary cities, all the things that are driving — that are driving wages down in this country, Senator, and also too often with criminal aliens in the country, it's bringing heartbreak.\nBut I — Donald Trump has a plan that he laid out in Arizona, that will deal systemically with illegal immigration, beginning with border security, internal enforcement. It's probably why for the first time in the history of Immigration and Customs Enforcement their union actually endorsed Donald Trump as the next president of the United States, because they know they need help to enforce the laws of this country.\nAnd Donald Trump has laid out a priority to remove criminal aliens, remove people that have overstayed their visas. And — and once we have accomplished all of that, which will — which will strengthen our economy, strengthen the rule of law in the country and make our communities safer once the criminal aliens are out, then we'll deal with those that remain.\nBut I have to tell you, I just — I was listening to the avalanche of insults coming out of Senator Kaine a minute ago. KAINE: These were Donald's — hold on a second, Governor.\n[crosstalk]\nPENCE: It's my time, Senator.\nQUIJANO: It is, in fact, the governor's time.\nKAINE: I apologize. It's your two minutes. I apologize.\nPENCE: Thanks. I forgive you. He says ours is an insult-driven campaign. Did you all just hear that? Ours is an insult-driven campaign?\nI mean, to be honest with you, if Donald Trump had said all of the things that you've said he said in the way you said he said them, he still wouldn't have a fraction of the insults that Hillary Clinton leveled when she said that half of our supporters were a basket of deplorables. It's — she said they were irredeemable, they were not American.\nI mean, it's extraordinary. And then she labeled one after another \"ism\" on millions of Americans who believe that we can have a stronger America at home and abroad, who believe we can get this economy moving again, who believe that we can end illegal immigration once and for all. So, Senator, this — this insult-driven campaign, I mean...\nQUIJANO: Governor...\nPENCE: That's small potatoes compared to Hillary Clinton...\nQUIJANO: Senator Kaine?\nPENCE: .... calling half of Donald Trump's supporters a basket of deplorables.\nKAINE: Hillary Clinton said something on the campaign trail, and the very next day, she said, you know what, I shouldn't have said that.\nPENCE: She said she shouldn't have said half.\nQUIJANO: Governor, this is Senator Kaine's two minutes, please.\nKAINE: Yeah, that's right, so now we're even.\nPENCE: Yeah. [laughther]\nKAINE: Look for Donald trump apologizing to John McCain for saying he wasn't a hero...\nPENCE: Oh...\nKAINE: ... to Donald Trump apologizing for calling women slobs, pigs, dogs, disgusting.\nPENCE: She apologized for saying \"half.\"\nQUIJANO: Governor. It is his two minutes, please.\nKAINE: Did Donald Trump apologize for taking after somebody in a Twitter war and making fun of her weight? Did he apologize for saying African-Americans are living in Hell? Did he apologize for saying President Obama was not even a citizen of the United States? You will look in vain to see Donald Trump ever taking responsibility for anybody and apologizing.\nImmigration. There's two plans on the table. Hillary and I believe in comprehensive immigration reform. Donald Trump believes in deportation nation. You've got to pick your choice. Hillary and I want a bipartisan reform that will put keeping families together as the top goal, second, that will help focus enforcement efforts on those who are violent, third, that will do more border control, and, fourth, that will provide a path to citizenship for those who work hard, pay taxes, play by the rules, and take criminal background record checks.\nThat's our proposal. Donald Trump proposes to deport 16 million people, 11 million who are here without documents. And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence want to get rid of birthright citizenship. So if you're born here, but your parents don't have documents, they want to eliminate that. That's another 4.5 million people.\nThese guys — and Donald Trump have said it — deportation force. They want to go house to house, school to school, business to business, and kick out 16 million people. And I cannot believe...\nPENCE: That's nonsense. That's nonsense.\nKAINE: I cannot believe that Governor Pence would sit here and defend his running mate's claim that we should create a deportation force to — so that they'll all be gone.\nPENCE: Senator, we have a deportation force. It's called Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. And the union for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement for the first time in their history endorsed Donald Trump to be the next president of the United States of America.\nKAINE: So you like the 16 million deportations?\nPENCE: Senator, that's — that's nonsense. Look, what you just heard is they have a plan for open borders, amnesty. That's...[crosstalk]\nKAINE: Our plan is like Ronald Reagan's plan from 1986.\nPENCE: They call it comprehensive immigration reform — they call it comprehensive immigration reform on Capitol Hill. We all know the routine. It's amnesty. And you heard one of the last things he mentioned was border security.\nThat's how Washington always plays it.\nKAINE: No, I...\nPENCE: They always say we're going to do this, we're going to do that, we'll eventually get the border...[crosstalk]\nKAINE: ... border security three years ago, and Governor Pence was against it.\nQUIJANO: Governor, Mr. Trump has said...\nPENCE: Ronald Reagan said a nation without borders is not a nation. Donald Trump is committed to restoring the borders of this nation and securing our nation, enforcing our laws.\nQUIJANO: So, Governor, how would these millions of undocumented immigrants leave? Would they be forcibly removed?\nPENCE: Well, I think Donald Trump laid out a series of priorities that doesn't ends with border security. It begins with border security. And after we secure the border, not only build a wall, but beneath the ground and in the air, we do internal enforcement.\nBut he said the focus has to be on criminal aliens. We just — we just had a conversation about law enforcement. We just had a conversation about the — the violence that's besetting our cities. The reality is that there's heartbreak and tragedy that has struck American families because people that came into this country illegally are now involved in criminal enterprise and activity. And we don't have the resources or the will to deport them systemically.\nDonald Trump has said we're going to move those people out, people who've overstayed their visas. We're going to enforce the law of this country. We're going to strengthen Immigrations and Customs Enforcements with more resources and more personnel to be able to do that. And then Donald Trump has made it clear, once we've done all of those things, that we're going to reform the immigration system that we have...\nKAINE: I just have to correct Governor Pence....\nPENCE: ... where people can come into this country.\nKAINE: I have to...\nPENCE: That's the order that you should do it. Border security, removing criminal aliens, upholding with law, and then — but then, Senator, I'll work you when you go back to the Senate, I promise you, we'll work you to reform the immigration system.\nKAINE: I look forward to working together in whatever capacities we serve in. But I just want to make it very, very clear that he's trying to fuzz up what Donald Trump has said. When Donald Trump spoke in Phoenix, he looked the audience in the eye and he said, no, we're building a wall, and we're deporting everybody. He said, quote, \"They will all be gone.\" \"They will all be gone.\" And this is one of these ones where you can just go to the tape on it and see what Donald Trump has said. And to add...\nPENCE: He's talking about criminal aliens.\nKAINE: And to add to it, and to add to it, and to add to it, we are a nation of immigrants. Mike Pence and I both are descended from immigrant families. Some things, you know, maybe weren't said so great about the Irish when they came, but we've done well by absorbing immigrants, and it's made our nation stronger.\nWhen Donald Trump says Mexicans are rapists and criminals, Mexican immigrants, when Donald Trump says about your judge, a Hoosier judge, he said that Judge Curiel was unqualified to hear a case because his parents were Mexican, I can't imagine how you could defend that.\nQUIJANO: Gentleman, I'd like to shift now to the threat of terrorism. Do you think the world today is a safer or more dangerous place than it was eight years ago? Has the terrorist threat increased or decreased? Senator Kaine?\nKAINE: The terrorist threat has decreased in some ways, because bin Laden is dead. The terrorist threat has decreased in some ways because an Iranian nuclear weapons program has been stopped. The terrorist threat to United States troops has been decreased in some ways because there's not 175,000 in a dangerous part of the world. There's only 15,000.\nBut there are other parts of the world that are challenging. Let me tell you this: To beat terrorism, there's only one candidate who can do it, and it's Hillary Clinton. Remember, Hillary Clinton was the senator from New York on 9/11. She was there at the World Trade Center when they were still searching for victims and survivors. That's seared onto her, the need to beat terrorism.\nAnd she's got a plan to do it. She was part of the national security team that wiped out bin Laden. Here's her plan to defeat ISIL. First, we've got to keep taking out their leaders on the battlefield. She was part of the team that got bin Laden, and she'll lead the team that will get Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the head of ISIS.\nSecond, we've got to disrupt financing networks, third, disrupt their ability to recruit on the Internet, in their safe havens. But, fourth, we also have to work with allies to share and surge intelligence. That's the Hillary Clinton plan; she's got the experience to do it.\nDonald Trump. Donald Trump can't start a Twitter war with Miss Universe without shooting himself in the foot. Donald Trump doesn't have a plan. He said, \"I have a secret plan,\" and then he said, \"Um, I know more than all the generals about ISIL.\" And then he said, \"I'm going to call the generals to help me figure out a plan.\" And finally he said, \"I'm going to fire all the generals.\" He doesn't have a plan.\nBut he does have dangerous ideas. Here's four. He trash talks the military. The military is a disaster, John McCain's no hero, the generals need all to be fired, and I know more than them. He wants to tear up alliances. NATO is obsolete, and we'll only work together with Israel if they pay \"big league.\"\nThird, he loves dictators. He's got kind of a personal Mount Rushmore, Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-un, Moammar Gadhafi...\nPENCE: Oh, please. Come on.\nKAINE: ... and Saddam Hussein. And last and most dangerously, Donald Trump believes — Donald Trump believes that the world will be safer if more nations have nuclear weapons. He's said Saudi Arabia should get them, Japan should get them, Korea should get them. And when he was confronted with this, and told, wait a minute, terrorists could get those, proliferation could lead to nuclear war, here's what Donald Trump said, and I quote: \"Go ahead, folks, enjoy yourselves.\"\nI'd love to hear Governor Pence tell me what's so enjoyable or comical about nuclear war.\nQUIJANO: Governor Pence?\nPENCE: Did you work on that one a long time? Because that had a lot of really creative lines in it.\nKAINE: Well, I'm going to see if you can defend any of it.\nPENCE: Well, look, I can defend — I — I — I can — I can make very clear to the American people, after traveling millions of miles as our secretary of state, after being the architect of the foreign policy of this administration, America is less safe today than it was the day that Barack Obama became president of the United States. It's absolutely inarguable.\nWe've weakened America's place in the world. It's been a combination of factors, but mostly it's been a lack of leadership. I mean, I will give you — and I was in Washington, D.C., on 9/11. I saw the clouds of smoke rise from the Pentagon.\nKAINE: I was in Virginia where the Pentagon's...[crosstalk]\nPENCE: I know you were. We all lived through that day as a nation. It was heartbreaking. And I want to give this president credit for bringing Osama bin Laden to justice.\nBut the truth is, Osama bin Laden led Al Qaida. Our primary threat today is ISIS. And because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement that would have allowed some American combat troops to remain in Iraq and secure the hard fought gains the American soldier had won by 2009, ISIS was able to be literally conjured up out of the desert, and it's overrun vast areas that the American soldier had won in Operation Iraqi Freedom.\nMy heart breaks for the likes of Lance Cpl. Scott Zubowski. He fell in Fallujah in 2005. He fought hard through some of the most difficult days in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and he paid the ultimate sacrifice to defend our freedom and secure that nation. And that nation was secured in 2009.\nBut because Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama failed to provide a status of forces agreement and leave sufficient troops in there, we are back at war. The president just ordered more troops on the ground. We are back at war in Iraq. And Scott Zubowski, whose mom would always come to Memorial Day events in Newcastle, Indiana, to see me, and I'd give her a hug and tell her we're never going to forget her son and we never will, Scott Zubowski and the sacrifices the American soldier made were squandered in Iraq because this administration created a vacuum in which ISIS was able to grow.\nAnd a reference to the Iranian deal, the Iranian deal that Hillary Clinton initiated, $150 billion to the radical mullahs in Iran.\nKAINE: Stopping a nuclear weapons program without firing a shot?\nPENCE: You didn't stop the nuclear weapons program.\nKAINE: Yes, we did.\nPENCE: You essentially...\nKAINE: Even the Israeli military says it stopped.\nPENCE: ... guaranteed that Iran will someday become a nuclear power, because there's no limitations once the period of time of the treaty comes off.\nQUIJANO: Governor Pence, Mr. Trump has proposed extreme vetting of immigrants from parts of the world that export terrorism. But that does not address many of the recent terrorist attacks in the United States, such as the Orlando nightclub massacre and the recent bombings in New York and New Jersey. Those were homegrown, committed by U.S. citizens and legal residents. What specific tools would you use to prevent those kinds of attacks?\nPENCE: Well, I think it's — I think it's a great question, Elaine, but it really does begin with us reforming our immigration system and putting the interests, particularly the safety and security of the American people, first.\nI mean, Donald Trump has called for extreme vetting for people coming into this country so that we don't bring people into the United States who are hostile to our Bill of Rights freedoms, who are hostile to the American way life.\nBut also, Donald Trump and I are committed to suspending the Syrian refugee program and programs and immigration from areas of the world that have been compromised by terrorism. Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to increase the Syrian refugee program by 500...[crosstalk]\nKAINE: Elaine, I want to...[crosstalk]\nQUIJANO: Governor, the question was about homegrown.\nPENCE: Yeah, and so — but first, you know, let's make sure we're putting the safety and security of the American people first instead of Hillary Clinton expanding the Syrian refugee program...\nKAINE: Or instead of you violating the Constitution by blocking people based on their national origin rather than whether they're dangerous.\nPENCE: That's not — that's absolutely false.\nKAINE: That's what the Seventh Circuit decided just — here's the difference, Elaine.\nPENCE: The Seventh Circuit...\nKAINE: We have different views on — on refugee issues and on immigration. Hillary and I want to do enforcement based on, are people dangerous? These guys say all Mexicans are bad.\nPENCE: That's absolutely false.\nKAINE: And with respect to refugees, we want to keep people out if they're dangerous. Donald Trump said keep them out if they're Muslim. Mike Pence...\nPENCE: Absolutely...\nKAINE: ... put a program in place to keep them out if they're from Syria. And yesterday an appellate court with three Republican judges struck down the Pence plan...\nPENCE: Right. Right.\nKAINE: ... and said it was discriminatory...\nPENCE: And those judges — those judges said...\nKAINE: We should focus upon danger, not upon discrimination.\nQUIJANO: Governor?\nPENCE: Elaine, to your point, those judges said it was because there wasn't any evidence yet that — that ISIS had infiltrated the United States. Well, Germany just arrested three Syrian refugees that were connected to ISIS.\n[crosstalk]\nKAINE: But they told you there's a right way and a wrong way to do it.\nPENCE: But, look, if you're going to be critical of me on that, that's fair game. I will tell you, after two Syrian refugees were involved in the attack in Paris that is called Paris' 9/11, as governor of the state of Indiana, I have no higher priority than the safety and security of the people of my state.\nKAINE: But, Governor Pence...\nPENCE: So you bet I suspended that program.\nKAINE: But, Governor Pence, I just...\nPENCE: And I stand by that decision. And if I'm vice president of the United States or Donald Trump is president, we're going to put the safety and security of the American people first.\nKAINE: Sure. Can we just be clear — Hillary and I will do immigration enforcement and we'll vet refugees based on whether they're dangerous or not. We won't do it based on discriminating against you from the country you come from or the religion that you practice.\nPENCE: But the problem with that...\nKAINE: That is completely antithetical to the Jeffersonian values of...[crosstalk]\nPENCE: Elaine, the director of the FBI, our homeland security, said we can't know for certain who these people are coming from Syria.\nKAINE: Yes, we can, and when we don't let them know, we don't let them in.\nPENCE: So — the FBI...\nKAINE: When we don't know who they are, we don't let them in.\nPENCE: The FBI and homeland security said we can't know for certain. You've got to err on the side of the safety and security of the American people, Senator. I understand the...\nKAINE: By trashing all Syrians or trashing all Muslims?\nPENCE: ... the U.N. wants us to expand the Syrian refugee program...\nQUIJANO: Senator Kaine, let me ask you this. Secretary Clinton...\nPENCE: We're going to put the safety and security of the American people first.\nQUIJANO: ... has talked about an intelligence surge.\nKAINE: Yes.\nQUIJANO: What exactly would an intelligence surge look like? And how would that help identify terrorists with no operational connection to a foreign terrorist organization?\nKAINE: Intelligence surge is two-thirds, Elaine. It's two things. It's, first, dramatically expanding our intelligence capacities by hiring great professionals, but also we've got some of the best intel and cyber employees in the world right here in the United States working for many of our private sector companies.\nSo it involves increasing our own workforce, but striking great partnerships with some of our cyber and intel experts in the private sector so that we can, consistent with constitutional principles, gather more intelligence.\nBut the second piece of this is really, really important. It also means creating stronger alliances, because you gather intelligence and then you share your intelligence back and forth with allies. And that's how you find out who may be trying to recruit, who may be trying to come to one country or the next. Alliances are critical.\nThat's why Donald Trump's claim that he wants to — that NATO is obsolete and that we need to get rid of NATO is so dangerous.\nPENCE: That's not his plan. KAINE: Well, he said NATO is obsolete. And, look, if you put aside — push aside your alliances, who you're going to share intelligence with? Hillary Clinton is the secretary of state who knows how to build alliances. She built the sanctions regime around the word that stopped the Iranian nuclear weapons program. And that's what an intelligence surge means. Better skill and capacity, but also better alliances.\nQUIJANO: All right. I'd like to turn now to the tragedy in Syria. Two hundred fifty thousand...\nPENCE: Can I speak about the cybersecurity surge at all?\nQUIJANO: You can — you can have 30 seconds, Governor, quickly, please.\nPENCE: First, Donald Trump just spoke about this issue this week. We have got to bring together the best resources of this country to understand that cyber warfare is the new warfare of the asymmetrical enemies that we face in this country. And I look forward if I'm privileged to be in this role of working with you in the Senate to make sure that we resource that effort.\nKAINE: We will work together in whatever roles we inhabit.\nPENCE: We have an intelligence, sir. But I will also tell you that it's important in this moment to remember that Hillary Clinton had a private server in her home that had classified information on it...\nQUIJANO: And I don't — 30 seconds is on up.\nPENCE: ... about drone strikes, e-mails from the president of the United States of America were on there.\nQUIJANO: Right.\nPENCE: Her private server was subject to being hacked by foreign...[crosstalk]\nQUIJANO: I'd like to ask you about Syria, Governor.\nPENCE: We could put cybersecurity first if we just make sure the next secretary of state doesn't have a private server.\n[crosstalk]\nKAINE: And all investigation concluded that not one reasonable prosecutor would take any additional step. You don't get to decide the rights and wrongs of this. We have a justice system that does that. And a Republican FBI director did an investigation and concluded that...[crosstalk]\nQUIJANO: All right, we are moving on now. Two hundred fifty thousand people...\nPENCE: If your son or my son handled classified information the way Hillary Clinton did...\nQUIJANO: ... one hundred thousand of them children — Governor...\nPENCE: ... they'd be court martialed.\nKAINE: That is absolutely false and you know that.\nPENCE: Absolutely true.\nKAINE: And you know that, Governor.\nQUIJANO: Governor...\nPENCE: It's absolutely true.\nQUIJANO: Gentlemen, please.\nKAINE: Because the FBI did an investigation.\nQUIJANO: Gentlemen.\nKAINE: And they concluded that there was no reasonable prosecutor who would take it further. Sorry.\nQUIJANO: Senator Kaine, Governor Pence, please.\nKAINE: Syria.\nQUIJANO: I want to turn now to Syria. Two hundred fifty thousand people, 100,000 of them children, are under siege in Aleppo, Syria. Bunker buster bombs, cluster munitions, and incendiary weapons are being dropped on them by Russian and Syrian militaries. Does the U.S. have a responsibility to protect civilians and prevent mass casualties on this scale, Governor Pence?\nPENCE: The United States of America needs to begin to exercise strong leadership to protect the vulnerable citizens and over 100,000 children in Aleppo. Hillary Clinton's top priority when she became secretary of state was the Russian reset, the Russians reset. After the Russian reset, the Russians invaded Ukraine and took over Crimea.\nAnd the small and bullying leader of Russia is now dictating terms to the United States to the point where all the United States of America — the greatest nation on Earth — just withdraws from talks about a cease-fire while Vladimir Putin puts a missile defense system in Syria while he marshals the forces and begins — look, we have got to begin to lean into this with strong, broad-shouldered American leadership.\nIt begins by rebuilding our military. And the Russians and the Chinese have been making enormous investments in the military. We have the smallest Navy since 1916. We have the lowest number of troops since the end of the Second World War. We've got to work with Congress, and Donald Trump will, to rebuild our military and project American strength in the world.\nBut about Aleppo and about Syria, I truly do believe that what America ought to do right now is immediately establish safe zones, so that families and vulnerable families with children can move out of those areas, work with our Arab partners, real time, right now, to make that happen.\nAnd secondly, I just have to tell you that the provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength. And if Russia chooses to be involved and continue, I should say, to be involved in this barbaric attack on civilians in Aleppo, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike military targets of the Assad regime to prevent them from this humanitarian crisis that is taking place in Aleppo.\nThere's a broad range of other things that we ought to do, as well. We ought to deploy a missile defense shield to the Czech Republic and Poland which Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama pulled back on out of not wanting to offend the Russians back in 2009.\nQUIJANO: Governor, your two minutes are up.\nPENCE: We've just got to have American strength on the world stage. When Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, the Russians and other countries in the world will know they're dealing with a strong American president.\nQUIJANO: Senator Kaine?\nKAINE: Hillary and I also agree that the establishment of humanitarian zones in northern Syria with the provision of international human aid, consistent with the U.N. Security Council resolution that was passed in February 2014, would be a very, very good idea.\nAnd Hillary also has the ability to stand up to Russia in a way that this ticket does not. Donald Trump, again and again, has praised Vladimir Putin. And it's clear that he has business dealings with Russian oligarchs who are very connected to Putin.\nThe Trump campaign management team had to be fired a month or so ago because of those shadowy connections with pro-Putin forces. Governor Pence made the odd claim, he said inarguably Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama. Vladimir Putin has run his economy into the ground. He persecutes LGBT folks and journalists. If you don't know the difference between dictatorship and leadership, then you got to go back to a fifth-grade civics class.\nI'll tell you what offends me...\nPENCE: Well, that offended me.\nKAINE: Governor Pence just said — Governor Pence just said that Donald Trump will rebuild the military. No, he won't. Donald Trump is avoiding paying taxes. The New York Times story — and we need to get this — but the New York Times suggested that he probably didn't pay taxes for about 18 years starting in 1995. Those years included the years of 9/11.\nSo get this. On 9/11, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump's hometown was attacked by the worst terrorist attack in the history of the United States. Young men and women — young men and women signed up to serve in the military to fight terrorism. Hillary Clinton went to Washington to get funds to rebuild her city and protect first responders, but Donald Trump was fighting a very different fight. It was a fight to avoid paying taxes so that he wouldn't support the fight against terror.\nQUIJANO: The question was about Aleppo, Senator.\nKAINE: He wouldn't support troops. He wouldn't — he wouldn't support — this is important, Elaine. When a guy running for president will not support the troops, not support veterans, not support teachers, that's really important.\nQUIJANO: Right.\nKAINE: And I said about Aleppo, we do agree the notion is we have to create a humanitarian zone in northern Syria. It's very important.\nQUIJANO: Governor Pence, you had mentioned no-fly zone. Where would you propose setting up a safe zone specifically? How would you keep it safe?\nPENCE: Well, first and foremost, Donald Trump supports our troops. Donald Trump supports our veterans.\nKAINE: He won't pay taxes.\nPENCE: Donald Trump has paid all the taxes that he's — do you not take deductions? How does that work?\nQUIJANO: Gentlemen, this is about Syria. I'd like to...[crosstalk]\nPENCE: Honestly, Senator. Honestly, Senator.\nKAINE: It is about our troops. It is about our troops.\nPENCE: I understand why you want to change — I understand why you want to change the subject.\nKAINE: How can you support the troops if you won't pay taxes?\nPENCE: I understand why you want to change the subject. And let me be very clear on this Russian thing. The larger question here...\nKAINE: Do you think Donald Trump is smart to not pay taxes?\nQUIJANO: Gentlemen, we're going to have time to get to Russia here.\nPENCE: What we're dealing with is the — you know, there's an old proverb that says the Russian bear never dies, it just hibernates. And the truth of the matter is, the weak and feckless foreign policy of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama has awakened an aggression in Russia that first appeared a few years ago with their move in Georgia, now their move into Crimea, now their move into the wider Middle East.\nAnd all the while, all we do is fold our arms and say we're not having talks anymore. To answer your question, we just need American strength. We need to — we need to marshal the resources of our allies in the region, and in the immediate, we need to act and act now to get people out of harm's way.\nQUIJANO: And exactly how would those safe zones work? How would they remain safe?\nPENCE: The — the safe zones would have to be — as the senator said, there's already a framework for this that's been recognized by the international community. The United States of America needs to be prepared to work with our allies in the region to create a route for safe passage and then to protect people in those areas, including with a no-fly zone.\nBut, look, this is very tough stuff. I served on the Foreign Affairs Committee for a decade. I traveled in and out of that region for 10 years. I saw what the American soldier won in Operation Iraqi Freedom. And to see the weak and feckless leadership that Hillary Clinton was the architect of and the foreign policy of the Obama administration...\nKAINE: Well, let me — let me come back...\nPENCE: ... is deeply troubling to me. That will all change the day Donald Trump becomes president of the United States.\nKAINE: ... and talk about — let me talk about the things that Governor Pence doesn't want to acknowledge, Elaine. He doesn't want to acknowledge that we stopped the Iranian nuclear weapons program. He doesn't want to acknowledge...\nPENCE: We didn't.\nKAINE: ... that Hillary was part of a team that got bin Laden. He doesn't want to acknowledge...\nPENCE: I just did.\nKAINE: ... that it's a good thing, not a bad thing, that it's a good thing — not a bad thing — that we're down from 175,000 troops deployed overseas to 15,000.\nBut let me tell you what will really make the Middle East dangerous. Donald Trump's idea that more nations should get nuclear weapons, Saudi Arabia, Japan, South Korea. Ronald Reagan said something really interesting about nuclear proliferation back in the 1980s. He said the problem with nuclear proliferation is that some fool or maniac could trigger a catastrophic event. And I think that's who Governor Pence's running mate is, exactly who Governor Reagan warned us about.\nPENCE: And come on. Senator. Senator, that was even beneath you and Hillary Clinton. And that — that's pretty low.\nKAINE: But do you — do you think — do you think we should have — more nuclear weapons in the world will make us safer?\nPENCE: Senator, the...\nKAINE: That's what Donald Trump thinks.\nPENCE: Ronald Reagan also said nuclear war should never be fought because it can never be won. And the United States of America needs to make investments in modernizing our nuclear force for both deterrence...\nKAINE: But can you defend Donald Trump's claim that more nations should get nuclear weapons?\nPENCE: ... and assurance to our allies. But let me go back to this Iran thing. I mean, he keeps saying that they prevented — that Hillary Clinton started the deal with the Iranians prevented Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.\n[crosstalk]\nKAINE: That's what the Israeli joint chiefs of staff is saying right now.\nPENCE: Well, that's not what — that's not what Israel thinks.\nKAINE: Gadi Eizenkot, you can go check it.\nPENCE: You wouldn't necessarily know that.\nKAINE: Go to the tape.\nPENCE: I know you boycotted Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech when he came before the Congress.\nKAINE: No, I visited him in his office. I visited him in his office.\nPENCE: You boycotted the speech. The point is, what this Iran — so-called Iran deal did was essentially guarantee — I mean, when I was in Congress, I fought hard on a bipartisan basis with Republican and Democrat members to move forward the toughest sanctions, it — literally in the history of the United States, against Iran.\nKAINE: And then Hillary used them to get a deal.\nPENCE: We were bringing them to heel, but the goal was always that we would only lift the sanctions if Iran permanently renounced their nuclear ambitions.\nKAINE: Elaine, let me just mention one thing.\n[crosstalk]\nPENCE: They have not — Elaine, let me finish a sentence. They have not renounced their nuclear ambitions. And when the deal's period runs out, there's no limitation on them obtaining weapons. That...[crosstalk]\nQUIJANO: And very quickly, Senator.\nKAINE: Elaine...\nPENCE: ... and the fact that they got $1.7 billion in a ransom payment...\nQUIJANO: We need to talk about Russia. Very quickly, though, Senator, please.\nPENCE: ... is astonishing to the American people.\nKAINE: Six times tonight, I have said to Governor Pence I can't imagine how you can defend your running mate's position on one issue after the next. And in all six cases, he's refused to defend his running mate.\nPENCE: Well, let's — no, no, don't put words in my mouth.\nQUIJANO: All right.\nPENCE: He's going...[crosstalk]\nKAINE: And yet he is asking everybody to vote for somebody that he cannot defend. And I just think that should be underlined.\nPENCE: No, I'm — look...[crosstalk]\nQUIJANO: All right, gentlemen, let's talk about Russia. This is a topic that has come up.\nPENCE: I'm very, very happy to defend Donald Trump. If he wants to take these one at a time, I'll take them one at a time.\nQUIJANO: I will give you an opportunity to do that.\nKAINE: More nations should get nuclear weapons. Try to defend that.\nPENCE: Don't put words in my mouth. Well, he never said that, Senator.\nKAINE: He absolutely said it. Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Japan.\nPENCE: Most of the stuffy you've said, he's never said.\nQUIJANO: Gentlemen, Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, annexed Crimea, and has provided crucial military support to the Assad regime. What steps, if any, would your administration take to counter these actions? Senator Kaine?\nKAINE: You've got to be tough on Russia. So let's start with not praising Vladimir Putin as a great leader. Donald Trump and Mike Pence have said he's a great leader. And Donald Trump has business...\nPENCE: No, we haven't.\nKAINE: ... has business dealings — has business dealings with Russia that he refuses to disclose. Hillary Clinton has gone toe-to- toe with Russia. She went toe-to-toe with Russia as secretary of state to do the New START Agreement to reduce Russia's nuclear stockpile. She's had the experience doing it.\nShe went toe-to-toe with Russia and lodged protests when they went into Georgia. And we've done the same thing about Ukraine, but more than launching protests, we've put punishing economic sanctions on Russia that we need to continue.\nDonald Trump, on the other hand, didn't know that Russia had invaded the Crimea.\nPENCE: Oh, that's nonsense.\nKAINE: He was on a TV show a couple months back, and he said, \"I'll guarantee you this, Russia's not going into the Ukraine.\" And he had to be reminded that they had gone into the Crimea two years before.\nPENCE: He knew that.\nKAINE: Hillary Clinton has gone toe-to-toe with Russia to work out a deal on New START. She got them engaged on a meaningful way to cap Iran's nuclear weapons program. And yet she stood up to them on issues such as Syria and their invasion of Georgia. You've got to have the ability to do that, and Hillary does.\nOn the other hand, in Donald Trump, you have somebody who praises Vladimir Putin all the time. America should really wonder about a President Trump, who had a campaign manager with ties to Putin, pro- Putin elements in the Ukraine, who had to be fired for that reason. They should wonder — when Donald Trump is sitting down with Vladimir Putin, is it going to be America's bottom line or is it going to be Donald Trump's bottom line that he's going to be worried about with all of his business dealings?\nNow, this could be solved if Donald Trump would be willing to release his tax returns, as he told the American public that he would do. And I know he's laughing at this, but every president...\nPENCE: But what's it got to do with Russia?\nKAINE: Every president since Richard Nixon has done it, and Donald Trump has said I'm doing business with Russia. The only way the American public will see whether he has a conflict of interest...\nPENCE: No, he hasn't said that.\nKAINE: He has, actually.\nQUIJANO: Senator, your time is up. Governor?\nPENCE: Well, thanks. I'm just trying to keep up with the insult-driven campaign on the other side of the table.\nKAINE: You know, I'm just saying facts about your running mate.\nPENCE: Yeah.\nKAINE: And I know you can't defend.\nQUIJANO: Senator, please. This is the governor's two minutes.\nPENCE: I'm happy to defend him, Senator. Don't put words in my mouth that I'm not defending him.\nKAINE: You're not.\nPENCE: I'm happy to defend him. Most of what you said is completely false, and the American people know that.\nKAINE: I'll run through the list of things where you won't defend...\nPENCE: This isn't the old days where you can just say stuff and people believe it.\nQUIJANO: Senator, please. This is Governor Pence's two minutes.\nPENCE: Look, this is the alternative universe of Washington, D.C., versus reality. Hillary Clinton said her number-one priority was a reset with Russia. That reset resulted in the invasion of Ukraine, after they'd infiltrated with what are called little green men, Russian soldiers that were dressing up like Ukrainian dissidents, and then they moved all the way into Crimea, took over the Crimean Peninsula. Donald Trump knew that happened. He basically was saying it's not going to happen again. The truth of the matter is that what you have in the rise of aggressive Russia, which has had — increased its influence in Iran, that's now — now because of this deal is on a pathway in the future to obtain a nuclear — the leading state sponsor of terror in the world in Iran now has a closer working relationship with Russia because of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama's foreign policy and $150 billion and sanctions all being lifted.\nAnd then, of course, Syria, I mean, it really is extraordinary that — Syria is imploding. You just asked a very thoughtful question about the disaster in Aleppo. ISIS is headquartered in Raqqa. It is — ISIS from Raqqa has overrun vast areas that at great sacrifice the American soldier won in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and yet Senator Kaine still sits here, loyal soldier — I get all that — in saying that the foreign policy of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama somehow made the world more secure. I mean, it really is astonishing that on the day...\nKAINE: We even wiped out the leader of Al Qaida.\nPENCE: ... on the day that Iran released four American hostages...\nKAINE: We stopped Iran from getting nuclear weapons.\nQUIJANO: Governor...\nPENCE: ... we delivered $400 million in cash as a ransom payment for Americans held by the radical mullahs in Tehran.\n[crosstalk]\nQUIJANO: Governor, yesterday, Mr. Trump said...\nKAINE: And we stopped a nuclear weapons program without a shot.\nQUIJANO: ... quote, \"Putin has no respect for Hillary Clinton and no respect for Obama.\" Why do you think he'll respect a Trump- Pence administration?\nPENCE: Strength. Plain and simple.\nKAINE: Business dealings.\nPENCE: Donald Trump — that's nonsense. Donald Trump is a strong leader...\nKAINE: Donald Trump's son says that the Trump organization...\nPENCE: ... who is going to lead with American strength.\nQUIJANO: Please, Senator, I'll give you a chance to respond.\nPENCE: We're going to rebuild our military. And let me — let me — this whole Putin thing. Look, America is stronger than Russia. Our economy is 16 times larger than the Russian economy. America's political system is superior to the crony, corrupt capitalist system in Russia in every way.\nWhen Donald Trump and I observe that, as I've said in Syria, in Iran, in Ukraine, that the small and bullying leader of Russia has been stronger on the world stage than this administration, that's stating painful facts. That's not an endorsement of Vladimir Putin. That's an indictment of the weak and feckless leadership...\nQUIJANO: Senator Kaine?\nPENCE: ... of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.\nKAINE: Well, this is one where we can just kind of go to the tape on it. But Governor Pence said, inarguably, Vladimir Putin is a better leader than President Obama.\nPENCE: That is absolutely inaccurate.\nKAINE: And — and — and I just think a guy who praises...\nPENCE: He said he's stronger — he's been stronger on the world stage.\nKAINE: No, he said leader. And if — and I'll just say this, Governor.\nPENCE: You just said better.\nKAINE: If you mistake leadership for dictatorship, and you can't tell the difference, a country that's running its economy into the ground...\nPENCE: Yeah, here we go. This is the grade school thing again?\nKAINE: ... persecuting journalists...\nPENCE: Right, this is grade school.\nKAINE: ... if you can't tell the difference, you shouldn't be commander-in-chief.\nPENCE: Yeah.\nKAINE: And with Donald Trump — Donald Trump's sons say that they have all these business dealings with Russia. Those could be disclosed with tax returns, but they refuse to do them. Americans need to worry about whether Donald Trump will be watching out for America's bottom line or his own bottom line.\nQUIJANO: Senator Kaine, what went wrong with the Russia reset?\nKAINE: Vladimir Putin. Vladimir Putin is a dictator.\nQUIJANO: And what would do you differently?\nKAINE: Vladimir Putin is a dictator. He's not a leader. Anybody who thinks otherwise doesn't know Russian history and they don't know Vladimir Putin. Hillary Clinton knows exactly who this guy is. John McCain said, I look in his eyes and I see KGB. And Hillary kind of has that same feeling.\nPENCE: Right.\nKAINE: So how do deal with him? You've got to — we do have to deal with Russia in a lot of different ways. There are areas where we can cooperate. So it was Hillary Clinton who worked with Russia on the New START Treaty to reduce their nuclear weapons stockpile. It was Hillary Clinton that worked with Russia to get them engaged in a community of nations to stop the Iranian nuclear weapons without firing a shot.\nShe's not going around praising Vladimir Putin as a great guy. But she knows how to sit down at a table and negotiate tough deals. This is a very challenging part of the world, and we ought to have a commander-in-chief who is prepared and done it, rather than somebody who goes around praising Vladimir Putin as a great leader.\nQUIJANO: All right, I'd like to ask now about North Korea, Iran and the threat of nuclear weapons. North Korea recently conducted its fifth and most powerful nuclear test.\nPENCE: Right.\nQUIJANO: What specific steps would you take to prevent North Korea from developing a nuclear-armed missile capable of reaching the United States? Governor Pence?\nPENCE: Well, first, we need to — we need to make a commitment to rebuild our military, including modernizing our nuclear forces. And we also need — we also need an effective American diplomacy that will marshal the resources of nations in the Asian Pacific Rim to put pressure on North Korea, on Kim Jong-un, to abandon his nuclear ambitions. It has to remain the policy of the United States of America the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, plain and simple.\nAnd when Donald Trump is president of the United States, we're — we're not going to have the — the kind of posture in the world that has Russia invading Crimea and Ukraine, that has the Chinese building new islands in the South China Sea, that has literally the world, including North Korea, flouting American power. We're going to — we're going to go back to the days of peace through strength.\nBut I have to tell you that — that all this talk about tax returns — and I get it, you know, you want to keep bringing that up. It must have — must have...\nKAINE: Until he...[crosstalk]\nPENCE: ... done well in some focus group. But here — Hillary Clinton and her husband set up a private foundation called the Clinton Foundation. While she was secretary of state, the Clinton Foundation accepted tens of millions of dollars from foreign governments and foreign donors.\nNow, you all need to know out there, this is basic stuff. Foreign donors, and certainly foreign governments, cannot participate in the American political process. They cannot make financial contributions. But the Clintons figured out a way to create a foundation where foreign governments and foreign donors could donate millions of dollars. And then we found, thanks to the good work of the Associated Press, that more than half her private meetings when she was secretary of state were given to major donors of the Clinton Foundation. When you talk about all these — all these baseless rumors about Russia and the rest, Hillary Clinton — you asked the trustworthy question at the very beginning — the reason...\nQUIJANO: Governor, your two minutes are up.\nPENCE: ... the reason the American people don't trust Hillary Clinton is because they are looking at the pay to play politics that she operated with the Clinton Foundation through a private server...\nQUIJANO: Governor, please.\nPENCE: ... while she's secretary of state.\nQUIJANO: Your two minutes are up, Governor.\nPENCE: And they're saying enough is enough.\nQUIJANO: Senator Kaine?\nKAINE: I'm going to talk about the foundation, and then I'll talk about North Korea. So, on the foundation. I am glad to talk about the foundation. The Clinton Foundation is one of the highest- rated charities in the world. It provides AIDS drugs to about 11.5 million people. It helps Americans deal with opioid overdoses. It gets higher rankings for its charity than the American Red Cross does. The Clinton foundation does an awful lot of good work.\nHillary Clinton as secretary of state took no action to benefit the foundation. The State Department did an investigation, and they concluded that everything Hillary Clinton did as secretary of state was completely in the interest of the United States. So the foundation does good work. And Hillary Clinton as secretary of state acted in the interests of the United States.\nBut let's compare this now with the Trump organization and the Trump Foundation. The Trump organization is an octopus-like organization with tentacles all over the world whose conflict of interests could only be known if Donald Trump would release his tax returns. He's refused to do it.\nHis sons have said that the organization has a lot of business dealings in Russia. And remember, the Trump organization is not a non-profit. It's putting money into Donald Trump's pockets and into the pockets of his children, whereas the Clinton Foundation is a non- profit and no Clinton family member draws any salary.\nPENCE: The Trump Foundation is non-profit.\nKAINE: In addition, Donald Trump has a foundation. The foundation was just fined for illegally contributing foundation dollars to a political campaign of a Florida attorney general. They made an illegal contribution, and then they tried to hide it by disguising it to somebody else. And the person they donated to was somebody whose office was charged with investigating Trump University.\nThis is the difference between a foundation that does good work and a secretary of state who acted in accordance with American interest and somebody who is conflicted and doing work around the world and won't share with the American public what he's doing and what those conflicts are.\nQUIJANO: Governor, I will give you 30 seconds to respond, because I know you want to, but, again, I would remind you both this was about North Korea. [laughther]\nPENCE: Well, Thank you. Thank you. The Trump Foundation is a private family foundation. They give virtually every cent in the Trump Foundation to charitable causes.\nKAINE: Political contributions?\nPENCE: Less than ten cents on the dollar in the Clinton Foundation has gone to charitable causes.\nKAINE: A $20,000 portrait of Donald Trump? PENCE: Less than 10 cents on the dollar of the Clinton Foundation has gone to charitable causes.\nKAINE: Ninety percent.\nPENCE: It has been a platform for the Clintons to travel the world, to have staff. But honestly, Senator, we would know a lot more about it if Hillary Clinton would just turn over the 33,000 e-mails...\nQUIJANO: All right, let's turn back to North Korea...\nPENCE: ... that she refused to turn over in her private server...\nQUIJANO: Senator Kaine...\nPENCE: ... and we'd have a much better picture of what the Clinton Foundation was about.\nQUIJANO: Senator Kaine, if you had intelligence that North Korea was about to launch a missile, a nuclear-armed missile capable of reaching the United States, would you take preemptive action?\nKAINE: If we — look, a president should take action to defend the United States against imminent threat. You have to. A president has to do that. Now exactly what action, you would have to determine what your intelligence was, how certain you were of that intelligence, but you would have to take action.\nYou asked the question about how do we deal with a North Korea. I'm on the Foreign Relations Committee. We just did an extensive sanctions package against North Korea. And interestingly enough, Elaine, the U.N. followed and did this — virtually the same package. Often China will use their veto in the Security Council to veto a package like that. They're starting to get worried about North Korea, too. So they actually supported the sanctions package, even though many of the sanctions are against Chinese firms, Chinese financial institutions.\nSo we're working together with China, and we need to. China's another one of those relationships where it's competitive, it's also challenging, and in times like North Korea, we have to be able to cooperate. Hillary understands that very well. She went once famously to China and stood up at a human rights meeting and looked them in the eye and said, \"Women's rights are human rights.\" They didn't want her to say that, but she did.\nBut she's also worked on a lot of diplomatic and important diplomatic deals with China. And that's what it's going to take.\nThe thing I would worry a little bit about is that Donald Trump owes about $650 million to banks, including the Bank of China. I'm not sure he could stand up so tough to the people who have loaned him money.\nQUIJANO: All right. I'd like to turn to our next segment now. And in this, I'd like to focus on social issues. You have both been open about the role that faith has played in your lives. Can you discuss in detail a time when you struggled to balance your personal faith and a public policy position? Senator Kaine?\nKAINE: Yeah, that's an easy one for me, Elaine. It's an easy one. I'm really fortunate. I grew up in a wonderful household with great Irish Catholic parents. My mom and dad are sitting right here. I was educated by Jesuits at Rockhurst High School in Kansas City. My 40th reunion is in 10 days.\nAnd I worked with Jesuit missionaries in Honduras, now nearly 35 years ago, and they were the heroes of my life. I try to practice my religion in a very devout way and follow the teachings of my church in my own personal life. But I don't believe in this nation, a First Amendment nation, where we don't raise any religion over the other, and we allow people to worship as they please, that the doctrines of any one religion should be mandated for everyone.\nFor me, the hardest struggle in my faith life was the Catholic Church is against the death penalty and so am I. But I was governor of a state, and the state law said that there was a death penalty for crimes if the jury determined them to be heinous. And so I had to grapple with that.\nWhen I was running for governor, I was attacked pretty strongly because of my position on the death penalty. But I looked the voters of Virginia in the eye and said, look, this is my religion. I'm not going to change my religious practice to get one vote, but I know how to take an oath and uphold the law. And if you elect me, I will uphold the law.\nAnd I was elected, and I did. It was very, very difficult to allow executions to go forward, but in circumstances where I didn't feel like there was a case for clemency, I told Virginia voters I would uphold the law, and I did.\nThat was a real struggle. But I think it is really, really important that those of us who have deep faith lives don't feel that we could just substitute our own views for everybody else in society, regardless of their views.\nQUIJANO: Governor Pence?\nPENCE: Well, it's a wonderful question. And my Christian faith is at the very heart of who I am. I was also raised in a wonderful family of faith. It was a church on Sunday morning and grace before dinner.\nBut my Christian faith became real for me when I made a personal decision for Christ when I was a freshman in college. And I've tried to live that out however imperfectly every day of my life since. And with my wife at my side, we've followed a calling into public service, where we've — we've tried to — we've tried to keep faith with the values that we cherish.\nAnd with regard to when I struggle, I appreciate, and — and — and — I have a great deal of respect for Senator Kaine's sincere faith. I truly do.\nKAINE: That's shared.\nPENCE: But for me, I would tell you that for me the sanctity of life proceeds out of the belief that — that ancient principle that — where God says before you were formed in the womb, I knew you, and so for my first time in public life, I sought to stand with great compassion for the sanctity of life.\nThe state of Indiana has also sought to make sure that we expand alternatives in health care counseling for women, non-abortion alternatives. I'm also very pleased at the fact we're well on our way in Indiana to becoming the most pro-adoption state in America. I think if you're going to be pro-life, you should — you should be pro- adoption.\nBut what I can't understand is with Hillary Clinton and now Senator Kaine at her side is to support a practice like partial-birth abortion. I mean, to hold to the view — and I know Senator Kaine, you hold pro-life views personally — but the very idea that a child that is almost born into the world could still have their life taken from them is just anathema to me.\nAnd I cannot — I can't conscience about — about a party that supports that. Or that — I know you've historically opposed taxpayer funding of abortion. But Hillary Clinton wants to — wants to repeal the longstanding provision in the law where we said we wouldn't use taxpayer dollars to fund abortion.\nSo for me, my faith informs my life. I try and spend a little time on my knees every day. But it all for me begins with cherishing the dignity, the worth, the value of every human life.\nKAINE: Elaine, this is a fundamental question, a fundamental question. Hillary and I are both people out of religious backgrounds, from Methodist church experience, which was really formative for her as a public servant.\nBut we really feel like you should live fully and with enthusiasm the commands of your faith. But it is not the role of the public servant to mandate that for everybody else.\nSo let's talk about abortion and choice. Let's talk about them. We support Roe v. Wade. We support the constitutional right of American women to consult their own conscience, their own supportive partner, their own minister, but then make their own decision about pregnancy. That's something we trust American women to do that.\nAnd we don't think that women should be punished, as Donald Trump said they should, for making the decision to have an abortion.\nGovernor Pence wants to repeal Roe v. Wade. He said he wants to put it on the ash heap of history. And we have some young people in the audience who weren't even born when Roe was decided. This is pretty important. Before Roe v. Wade, states could pass criminal laws to do just that, to punish women if they made the choice to terminate a pregnancy.\nI think you should live your moral values. But the last thing, the very last thing that government should do is have laws that would punish women who make reproductive choices. And that is the fundamental difference between a Clinton-Kaine ticket and a Trump- Pence ticket that wants to punish women who make that choice.\nPENCE: No, it's really not. Donald Trump and I would never support legislation that punished women who made the heartbreaking choice to end a pregnancy.\nKAINE: Then why did Donald Trump say that?\nPENCE: We just never would.\nKAINE: Why did he say that?\nPENCE: Well, look, it's — look, he's not a polished politician like you and Hillary Clinton. And so...\nKAINE: Well, I would admit that's not a polished...[crosstalk]\nPENCE: You know, things don't always come out exactly the way he means them.\nKAINE: Well, can I say...\nPENCE: But I'm telling you what the policy of our administration would be.\nKAINE: Great line from the — great line from the gospel of Matthew. From the fullness of the heart, the mouth speaks.\nPENCE: Yeah.\nKAINE: When Donald Trump says women should be punished or Mexicans are rapists and criminals...\nPENCE: I'm telling you...\nKAINE: ... or John McCain is not a hero, he is showing you who he is.\nPENCE: Senator, you've whipped out that Mexican thing again. He — look...\nKAINE: Can you defend it?\nPENCE: There are criminal aliens in this country, Tim, who have come into this country illegally who are perpetrating violence and taking American lives.\nKAINE: You want to — you want to use a big broad brush against Mexicans on that?\nPENCE: He also said and many of them are good people. You keep leaving that out of your quote. And if you want me to go there, I'll go there.\nBut here's — there is a choice, and it is a choice on life. I couldn't be more proud to be standing with Donald Trump, who's standing for the right to life. It's a principle that — Senator Kaine — and I'm very gentle about this, because I really do respect you — it's a principle that you embrace.\nAnd I have appreciated the fact that you've supported the Hyde amendment, which bans the use of taxpayer funding for abortion, in the past, but that's not Hillary Clinton's view. People need to understand, we can come together as a nation. We can create a culture of life. More and more young people today are embracing life because we know we are — we're better for it. We can — like Mother Teresa said at that famous national prayer breakfast...\nKAINE: This is important —\nPENCE: ... bring the — let's welcome the children into our world. There are so many families around the country who can't have children. We could improve adoption...\nKAINE: But, Governor...\nPENCE: ... so that families that can't have children can adopt more readily those children from crisis pregnancies.\nKAINE: Governor, why don't you trust women to make this choice for themselves? We can encourage people to support life. Of course we can. But why don't you trust women? Why doesn't Donald Trump trust women to make this choice for themselves?\nThat's what we ought to be doing in public life. Living our lives of faith or motivation with enthusiasm and excitement, convincing other, dialoguing with each other about important moral issues of the day...\nPENCE: Because there are...\nKAINE: ... but on fundamental issues of morality, we should let women make their own decisions.\nPENCE: Because there is — a society can be judged by how it deals with its most vulnerable, the aged, the infirm, the disabled, and the unborn. I believe it with all my heart. And I couldn't be more proud to be standing with a pro-life candidate in Donald Trump.\nQUIJANO: I do have one final question for you both tonight. It has been a divisive campaign. Senator Kaine, if your ticket wins, what specifically are you going to do to unify the country and reassure the people who voted against you?\nKAINE: That's a really important one. That may be the $64,000 question, because it has been a divisive campaign. And again, Hillary is running a campaign about stronger together, and Donald Trump — and this is — this is not directed at this man, except to the extent that he can't defend Donald Trump — Donald Trump has run a campaign that's been about one insult after the next.\nBut we do have to bring the country together. So here's what we'll do. Hillary Clinton was first lady, then senator for eight years and secretary of state. And I served in the Senate. And I'm really amazed, Elaine, as I talk to Republican senators, how well they regard and respect Hillary Clinton.\nShe was on the Armed Services Committee. She was on other committees. She worked across the aisle when she was first lady to get the CHIP program passed so that 8 million low-income kids have health insurance in this country, including 150,000 in Indiana.\nShe worked across the aisle after 9/11 to get health benefits for the first responders who bravely went into the towers and into the Pentagon. She worked to get benefits for — TRICARE benefits for National Guard members, including Hoosiers and Virginians in the National Guard.\nShe has a track record of working across the aisle to make things happen. And, you know, Elaine, I have the same track record. I was a governor of Virginia with two Republican houses. And in the Senate, I have good working relationships across the aisle.\nBecause I think it's fine to be a Democrat or Republican or independent, but after Election Day, the goal is work together. And Hillary Clinton has a track record of accomplishment across the aisle that will enable her to do just that when we work with the new Congress in January.\nQUIJANO: Governor, how will you unify the country if you win?\nPENCE: Well, thank you, Elaine, and thanks for a great discussion...\nKAINE: Absolutely.\nPENCE: ... tonight. Thank you, Senator.\nThis is a very challenging time in the life of our nation. Weakened America's place in the world after the leadership of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama on the world stage has been followed by an economy that is truly struggling, stifled by an avalanche of more taxes, more regulation, Obamacare, the war on coal, and the kind of trade deals that have put American workers in the back seat. I think the best way that we can bring people together is through change in Washington, D.C.\nYou know, I served in Washington, D.C., for 12 years in the Congress of the United States. And I served with many Republicans and Democrats, men and women of goodwill. The potential is there to really change the direction of this country, but it's going to take leadership to do it.\nThe American people want to see our nation standing tall on the world stage again. They want to see us supporting our military, rebuilding our military, commanding the respect of the world, and they want to see the American economy off to the races again. They want to see an American comeback.\nAnd Donald Trump's entire career has been about building. It's been about — it's going through hardship just like a businessperson does and finding a way through smarts and ingenuity and resilience to fight forward and — when Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, we're going to have a stronger America.\nWhen you hear him say he wants to make America great again, when we do that, I truly do believe the American people are going to be standing taller. They're going to see that real change can happen after decades of just talking about it. And when that happens, the American people are going to stand tall, stand together, and we'll have the kind of unity that's been missing for way too long.\nQUIJANO: All right, gentlemen, thank you so much.\nThis concludes the vice presidential debate. My thanks to the candidates, the commission, and to you for watching. Please tune in this Sunday for the second presidential debate at Washington University in St. Louis and the final debate on October 19th at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.\nFrom Farmville, Virginia, I'm Elaine Quijano of CBS News.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "note": "As prepared for delivery.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119168", "text": "Thank you. I am so thrilled to be back in Arizona.\nIn 35 days, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.\nI am going to make America Rich again.\nI am going to end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, keep jobs from pouring out of our country, renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, and massively reduce taxes and regulations on our workers and our small businesses.\nMy economic agenda is very simple: jobs, jobs, jobs.\nI want to send our best wishes to the great governor Mike Pence, as he prepares for his debate tonight. The debate will be a contrast between our campaign of big ideas and bold solutions for tomorrow, versus the small and petty Clinton campaign that is stuck in the past. We are change – she is four more years of Obama.\nClinton can't talk about the real problems facing our country because she's the one who helped create all of our problems in the first place. To hide her corruption, she deleted 33,000 emails after a congressional subpoena.\nHillary Clinton has been there for 30 years, and hasn't fixed anything. In fact, she's just made things worse – she failed upstate New York, promising to create 200,000 jobs, but manufacturing is down almost 40 percent. She failed overseas, unleashing death and destruction. And she failed Latinos and African-Americans, producing only more poverty in the inner cities.\nNow, after years of failure, she complains about how I've used the tax laws to my benefit. Then why didn't she ever try to change those laws so I could not have used them the way I did? She could have changed those laws when she was in the Senate. The reason that she did not is that her donors and contributors have used those tax laws the same as I did.\nI know all their names, and I know who they are, but it's not up to me to make them public figures.\nTwo public Hillary supporters who are known are George Soros, who declared losses of $1.5 billion in just six months, and Warren Buffet who, in 2014, declared losses of $873 million.\nI know how the tax code works better than anyone, and I am going to fix it so it is fair, and just, and works for you and your family.\nI've made my money as a highly-successful private businessperson following the law. Hillary Clinton made her money as a corrupt public official violating the law and selling her government office.\nThe problems we face as a country are immense, and it is going to take bold action to turn things around.\nRight now, we owe $20 trillion in debt. It doubled under President Obama.\nOur infrastructure is like that of a third-world country.\nThe homicide rate last year experienced its largest single-year increase in 45 years.\nOur border is wide open, and drugs and criminal cartels our pouring into the country.\nThousands of refugees are being admitted, with no way to screen them, and are instantly made eligible for welfare and free healthcare – even as our own Veterans die waiting for the medical care they need.\nOur annual trade deficit with the world is nearly $800 billion a year.\nThe federal budget is a disaster. Our State Department, mostly under the watch of Hillary Clinton, misplaced or lost $6 billion in taxpayer funds.\nWe have the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.\nWe are nation divided, with race riots in the streets.\nOur college students graduate, loaded with debt, only to discover they can't find jobs – or certainly not the jobs they want.\nOverseas, our failed leaders have empowered Iran, unleashed ISIS, and turned Iraq, Libya and Syria into absolute chaos.\nOur allies aren't paying their fair share, foreign countries like Russia and China do not respect us, and our taxpaying citizens send troops and foreign aid all over the world even as their own cities can't provide the most basic services.\nAmerica needs a turnaround.\nAmerica needs a comeback.\nAmerica needs a change.\nThat is why I am running.\nFirst, we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.\nThe architect of Obamacare, Jonathan Gruber, admitted that the whole sales pitch was a lie – he called it the \"stupidity of the American voter.\" But the only stupidity was the stupidity of our leaders who passed this disaster into law over the objections of the American people.\nDo you remember all the lies? President Obama said if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor.\nHe promised his plan would reduce premiums by $2,500 dollars. Instead, they surged $5,000.\nNow, of all people, President Bill Clinton has come out and told the truth about Obamacare.\nHe has absolutely trashed President Obama's signature legislation. Remember, Hillary Clinton called Obamacare \"one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party of our country.\"\nBill has a different view. Here is what bill said:\nHe just said it's a \"crazy system,\" where people end up with \"premiums doubled and coverage cut in half.\" He said \"it's the craziest thing in the world.\"\nBill Clinton said:\n\"people out there [are] busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, [and] wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half…the people getting killed in this deal are the small business people and the individuals who make just a bit too much money to get any of these subsidies.\" Clinton added that it \"doesn't make any sense,\" and that \"the insurance model doesn't work.\"\nI couldn't agree more. Which is why, on my first day in office, I am going to ask a Republican Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare.\nThis is essential for Arizona. Because of Obamacare, most of the state will only have 1 carrier next year, and premiums are expected to go up by 49% next year.\nThere is only 1 way to stop it: to vote for Trump. Early ballots are mailed out on October 12th, and you need to mail them back in as early as you possibly can.\nNext, we are going to unleash American energy\nI just met with energy producers in Colorado, and they are pleading with the government to let them create jobs and wealth in the United States.\nAs part our plan to reach 4% growth and create at least 25 million new jobs, we are going to lift the restrictions on shale, oil, natural gas, clean coal, and all forms of job-producing American energy.\nFixing our trade deals will be the foundation of our economic revival\nChina, Japan, and Europe are printing huge sums of money – the devaluation of currencies is staggering as to what it represents for our country, our businesses, and our citizens.\nWe're not on a level playing field, and our politicians don't understand what is going on.\nOur jobs are being lost in massive numbers, and we are not making things in America anymore. Too much is being made in other countries.\nWhen I am President, we will start making things in America again.\nCompanies like Apple, will start making their computers and iPhones in our country.\nOur nation has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton's NAFTA – a deal supported by Hillary Clinton. Hillary's Korea deal also cost us another 100,000 jobs.\nSince China entered the World Trade Organization – another Bill and Hillary-backed deal – 70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States.\nThat's 15 factories closing a day, on average.\nNever in history has a country surrendered so much of its wealth to foreign countries.\nAs the factories leave, our money leaves with them. Stores close, schools suffer, the tax base erodes, wages fall and the quality of life declines.\nWe've rebuilt other countries at the expense of our own.\nCompanies like Carrier, General Electric, Motorola, Mattel, Fiat Chrysler, and so many others are moving their jobs to Mexico, and to other countries.\nAnd now, Ford has announced it's moving all of its small car production to Mexico also.\nWe are going to renegotiate NAFTA and if we don't get the deal we want, we will withdraw from NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal for our workers.\nWe are also going to stand up to foreign currency manipulation, and apply tariffs to countries that cheat.\nJobs will leave from other countries and come into the United States.\nFactories will come rushing in, our schools and communities will be revitalized, and our poorest citizens will get new jobs and higher pay –and new hope.\nBut to be a rich nation, we must also be a secure nation.\nSecurity begins at the border.\nA nation that doesn't control is borders is not a nation.\nA country that doesn't protect its people isn't a country.\nA government that doesn't put its own citizens first is a government unworthy and unfit to lead.\nHere are some heartbreaking examples of how our government has failed our citizens.\nCountless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this Administration. This includes incredible Americans like 21-year-old Sarah Root. The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered federal custody, and then was released into a U.S. community under the policies of this White House. He was released again after the crime, and is now at large.\nSarah had graduated from college with a 4.0, top of her class, the day before.\nAlso among the victims of the Obama-Clinton open borders policies was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21 year-old convenience store clerk in Mesa, Arizona. He was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary who had also been released from Federal Custody.\nAnother victim is Kate Steinle, gunned down in the Sanctuary City of San Francisco by an illegal immigrant deported five previous times.\nThen there is the case of 90 year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home. The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records who did not meet the Obama Administration's priorities for removal.\nIn California, a 64-yeard old Air Force Veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer. Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions, but was never deported.\nAlso in California, my good friend, Jamiel Shaw, lost his amazing son at the age of 17 – he was viciously shot and killed by an illegal immigrant with three gun charges, as well as battery of a police officer – but despite these previous crimes, he had not been deported.\nA 2011 report from the Government Accountability Office found that illegal immigrants and other non-citizens in our prisons and jails together had around 25,000 homicide arrests to their names.\nThere are more than 2 million criminal aliens in the county right now – when I am President, we are getting them out, and quickly.\nOn top of that, illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion a year. For the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next ten years, we could provide one million at-risk students with a school voucher.\nAt the same time, our country is being infiltrated by terrorists. Just yesterday, an immigrant from Bangladesh was charged in another ISIS plot. Hundreds of immigrants from high-risk regions have been implicated in terrorism inside the United States since 9/11.\nThe terrorists who planted the bombs in New York and Jersey, and who carried out the mall stabbing in Minnesota, were foreign nationals admitted into our country – as was the mall shooter in Washington.\nOr look at cases like the Boston Bombers, here on asylum, or the San Bernardino Shooter, here on a fiancй visa from Saudi Arabia. Or the Orlando shooter, the son of a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan.\nI am going to keep the terrorists out of our country.\nHillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian Refugees.\nHillary is for open borders.\nI am not running to be President of the world. I am running to be President of the United States. I am for America First.\nFor the first time in American history, we have the endorsement of our ICE officers and our Border Patrol officers.\nWe also have the endorsement of Sheriff Joe.\nWe are going to build a border wall, enforce our laws, and keep our people safe. The chaos, the violence and the crime will come to an end – beginning in January of 2017.\nWe are going to end the government corruption\nHillary Clinton put her emails on an illegal secret server open to foreign hacking. Then she bleached and destroyed 33,000 emails – after a congressional subpoena. She lied to Congress, under oath, and her staffers took the fifth amendment and got immunity deals. It's worse than Watergate.\nThe investigation of Hillary Clinton was rigged, and it's a shame, and it's one of the saddest things that have ever taken place in our nation.\nWe have become a Banana Republic.\nYesterday, we learned that the FBI made a side deal with Clinton's top aides to DESTROY their laptops.\nHillary Clinton is the ringleader of a criminal enterprise that has corrupted our government at the highest levels, and the American people have one chance to stop it – by sending in your ballots.\nWe are also going to fix our inner cities\n45% of African-American children under the age of six live in poverty.\n58% of African-American youth don't have jobs.\nMore than 3,000 have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.\nHomicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.\nThe Democrats, like Hillary Clinton, have run the inner cities for 50 years, six years, seventy years or more. They've produced only more joblessness, failing schools, and rising crime. They've horribly failed and abused our African-American and Latino communities.\nTo those African-Americans and Latinos suffering in our country I say: What do you have to lose? Vote For Donald Trump. I will fix it.\nTo everyone in the country I say: what do you have to lose?\nWe will have safe communities for EVERYONE.\nSchool choice for your children.\nGreat trade deals that bring jobs into our country, not out of our country.\nEveryone will be included in the American Dream.\nHere are the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:\nWe are going to have the biggest job-creating tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; end common core; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare affordable; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\nWe are going to rebuild America.\nWe are going to revitalize America.\nAnd we are going to unite America.\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\nYou're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. We're going to make history. This is a movement like you've never seen before. We're going to make history together.\nYou're going to look back at this event, and you're going to look back at November 8th, or the day you put in your early ballot, and say this is by far the most important vote I've ever cast for anyone at any time.\nYou are going to be proud of your country again, and you are going to be proud of your President again.\nA vote for me is a vote for change, and a vote for me is really a vote for you. You are voting to believe in yourselves. A vote for commonsense government, solutions to problems. It's a vote for jobs, jobs, jobs.\nIt's a vote for a government of, by and for the people.\nAll together, we are going to –\nMake America wealthy again.\nWe are going to make America strong again.\nWe are going to make America safe again.\nAnd we are going to make America great again.", "timestamp": "2016-10-04", "title": "Remarks at Prescott Valley Event Center in Prescott Valley, Arizona"}
{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119552", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n12:43 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. I got a couple of announcements before I get to your questions. Let me start by letting you know that the President has been updated this morning on Hurricane Matthew and the potential impact in the Caribbean and in the United States.\nAs we discussed yesterday, FEMA has deployed officials to state emergency operation centers in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. FEMA is also pre-positioning commodities and resources to incident support bases in Albany, Georgia and Fort Bragg, North Carolina. This is a relatively new innovation that FEMA has incorporated into the emergency response efforts. The strategy is essentially rooted in the idea that marshaling resources and storing them at a facility that is out of the path of the storm, but still in proximity to areas that could potentially be affected by the storm, can expedite the provision of assistance in the immediate aftermath of a storm. So they will be mobilizing, and already beginning to move supplies into Albany, Georgia and Fort Bragg, North Carolina, anticipating that those supplies may need to be delivered to affected areas shortly after the storm has passed.\nIn addition to that, an Incident Management Assistance Team is at the North Carolina Emergency Operations Center. And today, FEMA has deployed additional IMATs to Atlanta to support preparation activities and ensure that there are no unmet needs. Supplementary teams from around the country are ready to deploy on short notice to affected areas as necessary.\nIn addition to that, FEMA Regional Coordination Centers in Atlanta and Philadelphia will activate to 24/7 operations today. And the National Response Coordination Center, which is based -- which is here in Washington, D.C., at FEMA Headquarters, will begin 24/7 operations with full staffing on Thursday.\nIn the meantime, we encourage everyone in potentially affected areas, from Florida up through the Mid-Atlantic, to begin taking steps to prepare. Information on what exactly you can and should do is available at Ready.gov and on the FEMA smartphone app.\nNow, as all of your news outlets are reporting, there are locations in the Caribbean that are already being affected by this storm. The USAID Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance has deployed disaster response teams to Haiti, Jamaica and the Bahamas. Those teams were deployed in advance of the storm's arrival. And these disaster experts are actively monitoring the storm's track in real time, communicating with officials on the ground in Jamaica, Haiti, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas, and Belize, to ensure that relief efforts are being coordinated if U.S. assistance is necessary.\nIn support of those goals, USAID has also strategically pre-positioned emergency relief supplies, including shelter materials, blankets, hygiene kits, household items, and water purification equipment to ensure that they can be made available on short notice to communities that are directly affected by the storm. Obviously, some of those countries that I named don't have nearly the resources that we do in this country to deal with a storm as severe as Hurricane Matthew. And the United States stands ready to provide assistance to help people in those countries who are in need.\nBut as I mentioned yesterday, these are countries that don't have significant modern infrastructure, and this is one of the strongest storms to come along in several decades, at least in this part of the world. So obviously we want to keep our thoughts and prayers with people in these countries who are, even as we speak, facing a rather difficult situation.\nDue to the expected -- or at least the potential impact of Hurricane Matthew here in the United States, President Obama has decided to postpone his travel to Florida that was scheduled for tomorrow. The President had previously-scheduled events in both Tampa and Miami. In Tampa, the President planned to discuss some of the progress that our country has made as a result of the Affordable Care Act. And in Miami, the President was planning to participate in some campaign activities in support of Secretary Clinton's campaign.\nWe are hoping to be able to reschedule those events relatively soon, but that will be determined by the impact of the storm and by other components of the President's schedule. But we'll keep you posted on all of that.\nI did want to make one other note before I get to your questions, which is on a very different topic. Today, the United States Supreme Court begins its fall term without its full complement of justices as it takes on important issues that impact the lives of everyday Americans, including the right to vote, fair housing, and protecting the fairness of the stock market. The Supreme Court is in the position of being understaffed, even though the President did his job and put forward an eminently qualified nominee to fill the vacancy.\nThe Supreme Court is in this position even though the President's eminently qualified nominee fulfilled his obligations in the confirmation process, including meeting with a variety of members of the United States Senate, Democrats and Republicans. He filled out his questionnaire. He was somebody who achieved the highest rating -- or was given the highest rating by the American Bar Association. And he's somebody who had been prepared to participate in the confirmation process, including hearings. But yet, we have seen Republicans in the Senate refuse to do their job.\nThe Supreme Court is essentially in this position because the partisan dysfunction that Republicans have inflicted on Congress is now affecting the Supreme Court. And Republicans have offered no substantive reason for their refusal to give Chief Judge Garland, the most qualified Supreme Court nominee in our history, a fair hearing and an up or down vote. In fact, thanks to Republicans' admittedly unprecedented obstruction of this highly qualified nominee, this will be the first time since the Civil War that a Supreme Court seat was kept vacant through Election Day.\nI'll stop there. I've got more, and I'm happy to discuss this at greater length if any of you are interested. One thing I do want to commend to your attention -- the President has written an op-ed that was recently published at the Huffington Post. And I certainly commend that to your attention, as well. It's on this topic, and I think it underscores the significant questions for our democracy that are raised by the refusal of Republicans in the Senate to do their job and give fair consideration to an eminently qualified nominee that even Republicans have previously acknowledged is a consensus pick.\nSo with all that windup, Josh, let's go to questions that may be on your mind today.\nQ: Great. Thanks, Josh. Let's start with President Duterte of the Philippines telling the President that he can go to hell. He also said that he may break up with the U.S., apparently referring to the very mutual defense treaty that the White House has repeatedly said remains unaffected by the Philippines leader's more colorful comment. And in the past when we've asked you about these things that he said, you've pointed to some other elements of our cooperation, this hand-me-down ship that we gave them last year, and other things as signs that this relationship remains really strong. But I'm wondering, given these continuing inflammatory comments and also the very specific commitments on policy things, like saying we're not going to hold joint exercises anymore, is there anything that the leader of the Philippines could say, is there any breaking point where the U.S. starts to say, look, you're not acting much like an ally and maybe we want to reconsider whether this is something that's still in our interest, or something that still has an operational impact?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Josh, I anticipated that you might ask this question today because I've seen these comments and was obviously aware of the previous comments that you cited from President Duterte over the last several weeks. Those comments are at odds with the warm relationship that exists between the Filipino and American people. There's also an important record of cooperation between our two governments, cooperation that has continued under the Duterte government, in fact.\nThe United States-Philippines alliance is built on a 70-year history of strong people-to-people ties, including a vibrant Filipino-American diaspora and a long list of shared security concerns. So the focus of the Obama administration right now is on the broad relationship with the Philippines, and our work together in the many areas of mutual interest to improve the livelihoods of the Filipino people and uphold their shared democratic values.\nI think the best example of this is actually the response that was mobilized by the United States to help the Filipino government and the Filipino people deal with the aftermath of a historically large typhoon that hit that country a couple of years ago. Significant U.S. military assets were deployed to the Philippines to help communities that in some cases were cut off from the rest of the world because of the strength of the storm and the amount of rainfall and mudslides and other impacts that were precipitated by the storm.\nThat's an indication of the deep and strong relationship between our two countries, and a genuine interest that the United States has in the strength of that alliance and in the safety and security of the Filipino people. I think it's just one recent good example of the extraordinarily warm feelings that the Filipino people have for the United States of America.\nAnd I can tell you that the United States has not received any official requests from President Duterte or any other Filipino officials to alter any aspects of our bilateral cooperation. In fact -- and you made an allusion to this in your question -- today marks the beginning of our annual joint military exercises with the Philippines, an example of the strong partnership and alliance that is in place. This is an alliance that is robust and benefits both of our countries.\nEven as we protect this strong alliance, the administration and the United States of America will not hesitate to raise our concerns about extrajudicial killings. We remain deeply concerned by reports of widespread extrajudicial killings by or at the behest of government authorities in the Philippines. The use of that kind of tactic is entirely inconsistent with universal human rights and the shared values of our two countries. And we value the strong alliance with the Philippines, but we won't be silent in raising our significant concerns about these kinds of reports.\nQ: And in the past when the Philippine leaders made some of these comments, the White House has said publicly that U.S. officials were reaching out to the Filipinos to get some clarity about what he meant. Can you say whether the U.S. has reached out either about the way he described the President or, more specifically, about him saying he might break up with the U.S. to get some clarity about whether he was referring to actually revoking the treaty between the two countries?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, the diplomatic lines of communication between the United States and the Philippines remains open and obviously there are a variety of channels for communicating with leaders in the Philippines, including our military-to-military channel that's being exercised just today by commencing our joint military exercises that are held on an annual basis. So we've got open lines of communication with the Filipino government, and we have not yet received any sort of formal communication using those channels from the Filipino government about making substantial changes to our bilateral relationship.\nSo we've obviously seen the rhetoric, but we're also aware of the kind of communication that U.S. officials had had with their counterparts throughout the government in the Philippines. And our commitment to protecting and strengthening the alliance between the United States and the Philippines is firm.\nQ: And former President Clinton was campaigning for his wife in Michigan last night, was talking about what's happened under Obamacare; he called it the craziest thing in the world. He seemed to be referring very specifically to what's happened as a result of Obamacare and not our broader health care challenges, but these millions that have come into the system and then seen their premiums double. I guess what would be the question is, does the President still have full confidence in his \"secretary of explaining stuff\"? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: That's a creative way of asking that question. Look, I think what I would start -- I would start by expressing the President's continued strong confidence in the benefits that that Affordable Care Act has provided to millions of Americans. Twenty million Americans have access to quality, affordable health insurance today that didn't have it before the Affordable Care Act went into effect. It would be even more if there weren't Republican governors across the country who were preventing otherwise eligible Americans from being able to get access to expanded Medicaid coverage. So the numbers would be even larger.\nAs a result of the establishment of marketplaces in states all across the country, Americans are now in a position where they don't have to fend for themselves in the individual market, but rather, insurance companies are coming to the marketplace and competing for their business. And that has -- because of the benefits provided by the federal government in the form of subsidies, the vast majority of individuals who are shopping on the marketplace are able to afford plans for less than $100 a month. That's an indication that most people are getting access to a good deal, and that is an indication of the effectiveness of the Affordable Care Act.\nPresident Obama has, of course, acknowledged that with cooperation from Democrats and Republicans in Congress, there are some things that could be done to further strengthen the law. And that's something that Secretary Clinton has vowed to pursue if she is elected President of the United States, and President Obama certainly can do everything he can to support that effort.\nBut the President is quite proud of the accomplishment of passing the Affordable Care Act. You'll recall we've made the point many times. Presidents in both parties made a strong effort to try to pass health care reform, but failed. President Obama was able to get it done, and the American people benefitted from that significant accomplishment.\nQ: But it must feel like a pretty significant blow to the President personally to hear the former President, the husband of the person he's campaigning to be his successor, exasperated about what's happened as a result of his law. I mean, does he disagree with what Clinton was saying?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, for the point that President Clinton was trying to make, I guess I'd refer you to his team. But I think what I would say is that the President is quite proud of the accomplishment of the Affordable Care Act. The American people benefit from the way the law has been implemented, in terms of expanding coverage, in terms of limiting the growth in health care cost, but also in terms of the many consumer protections that people who already had health insurance in the past now benefit from.\nThey no longer have to worry about getting kicked off their insurance because they get sick. They don't have to be worried about getting hauled into bankruptcy court if somebody in their family gets sick. They're able to keep their children on their health insurance plan up through age 26. People are able to get access to free annual check-ups, free birth control. These are all consumer protections put in place that hundreds of millions of Americans enjoy now because of the Affordable Care Act. And that's why the Affordable Care Act continues to be a source of pride for people who work here in the administration, in terms of that significant legislative accomplishment. And that's essentially our position.\nYou'd have to talk to President Clinton exactly what message he was trying to send.\nTim.\nQ: On refugees. The Turkish Defense Minister said today that the U.S. and its allies have to think carefully about retaking Mosul as it could trigger one million refugees that would be spread out to Turkey, Europe. Does the administration have any thoughts about that number, one million refugees? And would there be a way to kind of control that kind of population?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Tim, I can't confirm the number. I'd refer you to my colleagues at the State Department or the Department of Defense, who are obviously carefully considering the situation in Mosul. U.S. officials and others who are part of our counter-ISIL coalition have been closely consulting the Iraqi central government in terms of making plans to retake Mosul from ISIL forces that have controlled that city for a couple years now.\nThose plans include compensating for the population that's likely to try to flee Mosul. These are people who have faced a pretty difficult situation over the last couple of years. And there has been an effort to think through the potential impacts of undertaking this operation and driving ISIL out of Mosul. That has been an important priority of our counter-ISIL coalition, and more importantly, it's been a high priority of the Iraqi central government. So even as we make progress and plan to achieve the strategic objective, we're mindful of the potential consequences of doing so, and we'll plan accordingly.\nQ: Are the forces that are being sent over, are they keeping refugees in mind?\nMR. EARNEST: When you say the forces that are being sent over, you're referring to --\nQ: The U.S. to aid the Iraqi forces.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'll let my colleagues at the Department of Defense talk about the specific responsibility that individual U.S. military personnel will have in supporting Iraqi forces on the ground as they retake Mosul. So they can give you some greater clarity about what exact responsibilities they will have. But what we have made clear time and time again is that Iraqi security forces will be responsible for planning and leading that assault.\nThere will be U.S. military capabilities that we can bring to bear to assist them in that effort. In some cases, that may be U.S. Special Operations Forces acting in an advisory and assistance role. In some cases, that's U.S. military pilots that can carry out airstrikes in support of Iraqi security forces that are conducting operations on the ground. So there are a variety of ways that the United States military and the militaries of our counter-ISIL coalition partners can be used to assist and support Iraqi security forces as they pursue this goal.\nQ: And on Syria, I know the administration is not going to apologize for trying to reach a political solution there, but is there a chance that the administration has misjudged Russia's intent there to stick with Assad?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, are you suggesting that somehow there's evidence that the Russians are not backing Assad? I guess I don't quite understand the question.\nQ: It just seems that the U.S. has tried to reach this political solution and not thought through that maybe Russia is just going to stick with Assad the whole way through and not come to a political solution to get a new leader there.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think there's always been skepticism about whether or not the Russians were willing and able to exercise influence with the Assad regime. That was skepticism that you heard me express on the very first day we started talking about trying to reach an agreement around a Cessation of Hostilities. That skepticism was in place and firmly held, and for good reason. Russia has not demonstrated a lot of credibility in talking about these issues in the past.\nBut it would have been irresponsible for the United States and our coalition partners not to consider what we can do to try to address the root cause of the violence and chaos inside of Syria. So even though Russia has proven to be an unreliable, at best, interlocutor in these conversations, that doesn't change the conclusion that, at the end of the day, the root cause of the situation in Syria is a political challenge, is a political failure on the part of the Assad regime to effectively govern that country.\nThat means we need a political solution. And the United States has a variety of opportunities that we can pursue, and are pursuing, to try to address the root cause of this situation. The United States is able to work effectively through the International Syria Support Group to try to bring all sides to the table and facilitate a reduction in violence. The United States has been engaged in conversations with other countries that have interest in the region about confronting the challenge that is posed by the Assad regime and its failure to effectively lead that country. Of course, there is work being led by the U.N. Envoy to the situation, Mr. de Mistura, who's been working tirelessly to try to negotiate a reduction in the violence that far too many innocent Syrians are being subjected to right now.\nSo there are a variety of diplomatic avenues that the United States has been and will continue to pursue. But what is true is that Russia has either been unwilling or unable to fulfill the commitments that they made to the United States. That has hurt their credibility certainly with the United States, but it's also hurt their credibility with the international community.\nAnd Russia is in a situation where they are now essentially standing alone with the Iranians to support the Assad regime. And they do that in the face of international condemnation for the tactics that are being used by the Assad regime -- with the help of the Russians -- to target innocent civilians. In some cases, with cluster munitions; in other cases, using bunker-busting bombs to carry out attacks against facilities that treat civilians like hospitals, or in some cases even, underground recreation centers that are used by children. It's appalling what's taking place there. And Russia has rightly earned the stern rebuke of the international community for in some cases aiding and abetting those efforts; in other cases, refusing to use their influence and allowing those kinds of atrocities to occur.\nSo when President Putin arrived in New York a little over a year ago professing to insert Russia militarily more deeply into Syria and build a grand international coalition against extremists that were trying to capitalize on the chaos inside of Syria, he's failed in all of those stated goals. He has not built a grand international coalition. If anything, he has become further isolated. He has not emerged as a leading figure to confront this situation. He has emerged as the largest target of criticism from the international community for the tactics that they have employed or supported in the Syrian civil war. He has only deepened his country's involvement in a sectarian conflict that is fueling extremism and poses a greater risk to Russian individuals or military servicemembers who are in Syria. But it's also increased the risk that his country faces back home because of the extremism that's been fueled. So it's hard for President Putin to make a case that this has played out in a way that benefits his country.\nAnd I'd just point out that all of this takes place against the backdrop of a weakening Russian economy. The Russian economy now is smaller than Spain and Australia. According to an IMF report that was released just today, the Russian economy contracted once again in 2016 and is likely to remain weak through 2017. Their credit rating is essentially at junk status. And their reserves are being depleted just to try to shore up the value of their currency.\nSo I'm not sure if this is -- what master plan President Putin hoped to execute, but it's not benefitting the Russian people or the Russian economy. And it certainly isn't benefitting their national security.\nMary.\nQ: Back to Josh's question about the Affordable Care Act. Are you concerned that the former President's comments, calling it a \"crazy system,\" that that kind of language just gives more fuel to the Republican argument against the Affordable Care Act?\nMR. EARNEST: They seem to have built up plenty of fuel on their own, voting more than 50 times to try to repeal the law without actually offering up their own alternative. We've seen Republican officials twice go to the Supreme Court to try to tear down the law. Both of those efforts were unsuccessful. In the face of that political obstruction, and the millions of -- hundreds of millions of dollars that have been spent to try to criticize the law, we've actually seen a law that performed well in terms of expanding access to health care coverage and taking some important steps to provide Americans with the kinds of consumer protections that mean they no longer have to be as worried about the financial consequences of their family's health.\nSo the President is proud of that accomplishment. And those, frankly, are facts. And that is evidence that can't be refuted by language we hear on the stump from Democrats or Republicans, frankly.\nQ: And on Iran, Jason Rezaian is suing -- accusing Iran of hostage-taking, torture, and terrorism, saying that they held him for the unlawful purpose of extorting concessions from the U.S. What's your reaction? And do you think it's appropriate?\nMR. EARNEST: The United States is not a party to the lawsuit, and I don't make a habit of commenting extensively on private litigation. But what I will say is that for years, I stood at this podium and raised significant concerns about the unjust detention of an American journalist in Iran. And the President himself spoke rather powerfully about the effort that he was personally expending and that our government was mobilizing to secure his release. That effort was successful. He was detained unjustly in Iran for too long. But the President was obviously pleased to welcome him back to the United States with his wife.\nJustin.\nQ: Prime Minister May said that she plans to have to Brexit process begin by March of next year. That's caused some concern in the markets, but I'm wondering if that concern is merited here or that's sort of in keeping with the deliberative process that you've encouraged (inaudible).\nMR. EARNEST: Justin, the President has himself indicated that managing Brexit will be the responsibility of the British government. And the United States will seek to support them as they negotiate with the Europeans the nature of the relationship between the UK and the EU, post-Brexit. The United States is still committed to that process, and we're still going to encourage our allies in Europe and our allies in the UK to negotiate their differences and to negotiate the terms of what will be an enduring relationship.\nIt's in the interest of the United States for all sides to resolve this situation, but it's important for the individual parties to resolve it on the terms that they themselves establish. So we'll be supportive of the process moving forward, but ultimately these are decisions that should be left up to British officials and the EU officials with whom they are consulting.\nQ: The administration is reportedly considering a refugee sponsorship program, kind of based on the Canadian model, where private citizens could sponsor refugees to come to the United States. I'm wondering if that's a program that the President sort of sees as being feasible by the time he leaves office, and whether you'll need to or are anticipating seeking congressional approval for that, or if it's something you can do administratively.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Justin, I have to admit I haven't seen those specific reports. What I can tell you is that the President has made a forceful case on a number of occasions about the important role for the United States to play -- a leading role for the United States to play in terms of helping the world deal with refugee populations, in part because of our concern about the destabilizing impact that they're having in some other countries given how large these refugee populations are.\nBut the President has hastened to add at every turn that we're not going to cut corners when it comes to the safety and security of the American people. Refugees, as you know, are subjected to the most thorough vetting and screening of any individual who attempts to enter the United States. That's not going to change. And over this last fiscal year, we were able to make a significant increase in the number of refugees that were admitted to the United States, and we were able to do that without cutting any corners on the vetting process.\nBut as it relates to any sort of specific innovations that may be considered, we'll have to get back to you to see how seriously a proposal like that is being considered.\nQ: And on the last one, on creepy clowns -- (laughter) -- our friends at the Times reported that these sort of sightings have led to more than a dozen arrests, and some local law enforcement agencies are asking the FBI and DHS what to do about creepy clown sightings. So I'm wondering if the President is aware of this phenomenon and if the White House wants to say anything to discourage these types of pranks.\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know that the President has been briefed on this particular situation. This is something that I've read about in some of the news coverage. Obviously, this is a situation that local law enforcement authorities take quite seriously, and they should carefully and thoroughly review perceived threats to the safety of the community, and they should do so prudently. But I can't speak to any advice they may have received from law enforcement experts at the federal level, but you can check with my colleagues at the FBI and DHS and see what they have to say about that.\nApril.\nQ: Josh, a couple of questions. Is the President planning on watching the VP debate tonight, especially since last week's debate was so exciting?\nMR. EARNEST: Exciting? (Laughter.) I read a lot of post-debate analysis. \"Exciting\" was not an adjective that I saw in many of those reports. But that is the unique perspective that you bring to political analysis, April, and I think that would in part explain your popularity across the country.\nQ: Thank you. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Maybe even in this room. I will say, as we discussed yesterday in the briefing, the President has genuine affection for Senator Kaine, and the President believes, as we discussed, that he was an excellent choice as a running mate. And the President, I would expect, will tune in to at least part of the debate tonight. Senator Kaine is a fellow Kansas Citian, so hopefully he's going to bring some of that Midwestern charm to the debate, and I think it will serve him quite well.\nQ: We know who you're rooting for --\nMR. EARNEST: (Laughter.) If there was any doubt it's now been extinguished.\nQ: Secondly, in that first debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, Lester Holt asked a question about how to heal the racial divide in this nation. Does the President feel any responsibility for -- his time is up January 20th -- that he step in and try to heal the racial divide that has been evidencing itself more and more in the last couple of months with the debate and all that's happening when it comes to issues of police-involved shootings?\nMR. EARNEST: The President has spoken on this issue at much length, most recently I believe at the dedication of the new Smithsonian Institution just a couple of blocks away here.\nI don't know that there's much that I could add to the eloquence that he has demonstrated in talking about this issue, but certainly issues of race are issues that the President has written and spoken about at length, even prior to becoming a national figure. And I would anticipate the President will continue to write and talk and work on these issues, even after he leaves the White House.\nQ: Another question. After the GSA certifies the winner, be it November 8th, November 9th, whenever it's certified, will this President do what George W. Bush did in the Rose Garden the day after the election when Barack Obama was made the 44th President of the United States? No matter who is President, will President Obama mark the occasion and speak to the American people about the transition to the new President?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't know what the President's schedule on November 9th is going to be at this point. I also don't know what the weather will be on November 9th, so I don't know if it will accommodate a Rose Garden event. But the President made --\nQ: East Room.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me just answer your question this way. The President made clear at the beginning of this year that ensuring a smooth transition to the next President was going to be a top priority of his and of his White House staff. And the President's Deputy Chief of Staff, Anita Decker-Breckenridge, has been focused on this issue, and she's been engaged in leading that planning effort. This is an effort that has involved a number of different federal agencies, and there have been a number of meetings that are already being convened that she has facilitated that includes representatives from the GSA and representatives of the individual campaigns.\nPresident Obama has spoken at length about how President George W. Bush deserves enormous credit for the professionalism that he infused in the transition process back in 2008, and he set a very high standard for ensuring that an effective, seamless transition took place. And this administration is committed to at least meeting, if not exceeding, that very high standard.\nOlivier.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Back on August 30th, I asked whether is the administration ready to impose sanctions on Russia for deploying S-300 missiles in Syria. They have S-300 and S-400. The answer I got a month ago was, not yet ready to make a determination. Has that changed?\nMR. EARNEST: I didn't have an opportunity to review the transcript in the same way that you did. I know that there was some discussion about Russia providing that kind of equipment to Iran. So I don't recall it being asked in the context of Syria, but I certainly am aware of recent reports that that kind of military equipment has recently been transferred to Syria.\nI think I would start by observing that this equipment contradicts President Putin's own claims that their efforts in Syria are focused on extremists. I'm not aware that ISIL or al Qaeda in Syria is operating aircraft there. It's possible he may have access to different intelligence information, but I highly doubt it. So I do think it raises genuine questions about Russia's credibility and Russia's intentions inside of Syria.\nWith regard to sanctions, what we have indicated about the situation in Syria is that there are a range of tools that the President can use to further isolate the Syrian regime and potentially the Russians for the way they have supported the regime. Sanctions are among those tools. What we have learned over the last several years about implementing sanctions is that they are most effective and their impact is magnified when we coordinate the use of that tool with our allies and partners around the globe.\nSo we'll continue to have those kinds of conversations. I know there have been some legislative proposals that have been floated in Congress with regard to imposing sanctions against Syria. And what we have indicated is that that is, of course, an option that's available to the President, but we believe that that option is more likely to be effective not when it's implemented unilaterally, but rather when it is implemented in close coordination with our allies and partners.\nQ: All right, one more. The Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, has expressed concerns publicly, saying things like we're now going to retake Mosul, or offering similar indications about coalition intent, Iraqi intent, American intent are somehow tipping the coalition's hand to the extremists. Do you share those concerns, or why not?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we -- at least I have gone to great lengths to avoid a detailed discussion about our operational planning efforts. I know that my colleagues at the Department of Defense have undertaken similar efforts to exercise some discretion in talking about that kind of planning. So we certainly do not want to be in a position of tipping our hand when it comes to operational plans against Mosul.\nThat said, it shouldn't be a surprise to anybody that retaking Mosul from ISIL is one of the principal objectives of our counter-ISIL coalition, and there is no denying the important progress that we have made in taking back territory around Mosul and putting in place the kind of infrastructure that can support a large operation like the one that will be necessary to retake Mosul.\nSo we obviously are pleased with the gains that we've been able to make on the ground there recently. The planning is proceeding at the expected pace, but I don't have details to share about that and I've not heard anybody express any specific concerns about how discussing in general that planning process could impact the abilities to successfully execute that operation.\nVictoria.\nQ: There's a report in the Post that last Wednesday at the White House there was a meeting of officials from State, the CIA, and the Joint Chiefs, to discuss launching strikes on positions of Assad in Syria, both to punish him for breaking the ceasefire and to discourage him from launching attacks in Aleppo, and also to get him to come back to the table. Can you confirm that that meeting took place?\nMR. EARNEST: I cannot. There are national security discussions that take place at the White House frequently, many of them involve Syria. But I can't confirm any specific meetings, and I'm certainly not going to be in a position to discuss the content of any national security meetings that took place at the White House.\nQ: Are strikes against Assad under consideration by the White House?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I'm not going to get into any national security discussions that may or may not have taken place at the White House.\nPeter.\nQ: Josh, I saw the President's column in the Huffington Post. I'm curious if the President is concerned about the prospect of a deadlocked 4-4 court being responsible for handling any potential issues regarding the election or any potential recount needed on November 4th -- on the 8th.\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah, Peter -- President Reagan, actually, back in 1987 said it best when he made reference to the fact that the business of the American people is not well served by having an understaffed Supreme Court. And we've already seen the consequences of that understaffed Supreme Court failing to reach decisions on some important issues, including immigration reform. So the President is concerned about the inability of the Supreme Court to perform at the high level that we're all accustomed to.\nQ: Does that concern extend to any needs that may be created by this election?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I don't -- I think it's hard to speculate at this point what sort of role the Supreme Court could have in this election, but I think regardless of whether or not they're needed to resolve the outcome of a national election, the President is deeply concerned about the impact that the understaffed court is having on the ability of the Supreme Court to do its job.\nQ: Hillary Clinton said there should be a law that major party nominees should release their tax returns. Does the President support that? And would he sign a bill if one ever reached his desk?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I saw that report. I've made this point in this briefing room once before. I think one of the things that's important about this tradition, going back at least a generation of presidential candidates in both parties releasing their tax returns, is that those candidates didn't have to be compelled to do so. There was no law that was on the books that forced them to disclose those tax returns. That's something that they did voluntarily, demonstrating their own personal commitment to transparency.\nQ: So the President doesn't believe a law would be necessary and that the system presently as it is exists in a reasonable form?\nMR. EARNEST: I guess what I would say is the President doesn't believe that a law should be necessary. We've seen candidates in both parties. This is a principle that both parties have acknowledged is important in demonstrating transparency and demonstrating a willingness to be held accountable by the American people, particularly in advance of being entrusted with the significant authorities that are vested in the office of the presidency.\nQ: You said that the President would be watching the VP debate today. I trust that he supports Tim Kaine as he goes there. The last time that Senator Kaine was at Longwood University, he said to a class there, he said, \"We have operational plans but no strategy. We have a plan for what to do if North Korea were to move across the border into South Korea. We have a plan for what we would do if Putin decided to move Russian troops into a NATO-allied country. We have plans for all these eventualities, but we don't have a strategy.\" That was from the man who hopes to be Vice President, Tim Kaine. What does the President say to Tim Kaine about that commentary on this administration and our lack of a foreign policy strategy more broadly?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this is the first I'm hearing of those comments. What I will say is that the President and his national security team are always working through contingency plans, and there is a focus on making sure that the American people and our interests are protected around the globe, even in the event of urgent situations like the prospect that were floated in those two scenarios.\nCertainly demonstrating a commitment to our NATO alliance is something that President Obama has done throughout his presidency. And because of those efforts, that alliance has been strengthened over the eight years that he's been in office. The President traveled to the NATO Summit earlier this summer and actually made a commitment about an enhanced U.S. military presence in the eastern part of NATO, and I know there are similar commitments from the Canadians and others to demonstrate the strength of our NATO alliance.\nWith regard to North Korea, we've talked quite a bit about the efforts that have been put in place to ensure that the American people are safe from any provocative actions that are undertaken by the North Korean regime.\nQ: President Obama obviously doesn't believe that Donald Trump is fit to be President. But broadly speaking, as a businessman, given his success over the course of his life and whatever form you identify it, does the President believe that Donald Trump is a role model?\nMR. EARNEST: He does not. And I think he's made that pretty clear in a variety of settings.\nQ: Can you be a role model even if you're not President, I guess I'm saying. Is there some bar that's he's reached? He may not be fit for President, but do you think -- is there anything that we can say positive about the way he has conducted the course of his professional career?\nMR. EARNEST: Well look, there are hundreds of millions of Americans that, by the way they live their lives every day, are role models for our kids. But based on the President's deep concern about the rhetoric of the Republican nominee, I feel confident in telling you that he would not be comfortable with describing the nominee in that way.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I want to circle back on Gitmo for just a second. Would it be lawful to place, even temporarily, the detainees on American soil while they try to be moved out of harm's way for Hurricane Matthew?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware that that is the contingency plan that's been considered, but I'd refer you to my colleagues at the Department of Defense.\nQ: I want to also ask you about Syria. Can you draw a comparison or parallel to another circumstance in your mind that mirrors this one where the international community is aware of the mistreatment of the people of a country, potentially millions, maybe -- people not only on the run but certainly in crossfire -- and yet the international community, to this point, has been unable to stop the carnage?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, off the top of my head, I think the best example I can think of is something that Peter made reference to, which is North Korea. We know there is a murderous, totalitarian regime in North Korea that has condemned the citizens of North Korea to poverty. And because of the way that the leader of North Korea has isolated his country, the people of his country have been very poorly served by it. They are condemned to poverty. In some cases, there are flagrant violations of human rights and the use of tactics to try to shore up the stability of the regime there.\nAll of that is deeply concerning not just in the United States but to the rest of the international community. And I think what is true in North Korea is that the United States has worked to play a leading role in uniting the efforts of our allies and our partners in the region to apply pressure to the North Korean regime to get them to change. And we haven't seen the results that we would like to see in terms of bringing about that kind of change in North Korea.\nThe United States has worked in similar fashion to try to mobilize the international community to confront the situation in Syria. And again, we haven't seen as much of a change there as we would like to see. What we have seen in Syria, though, is an effective international campaign against ISIL and other extremists, including al Qaeda, that are seeking to capitalize on the chaos in that country to threaten and menace other parts of the world.\nSo from that standpoint, our international efforts have had a tangible and positive impact on our national security, but they have not yet resulted in the kinds of changes that we would like to see. I think the lesson from all of this -- and again, there's always a significant risk of trying to compare situations that are so different -- but I think the risk and the lesson in all of this -- and this is something the President has talked about -- is that it's important for us to be mindful of the long game, for us to think ahead about the potential consequences of actions that may be under consideration.\nThis, I think, is one of the lessons that the President believes we all learned, based on the ill-advised effort by the Bush administration to intervene and occupy Iraq. The long-term consequences of that decision and of those orders have had a significant and negative consequence on our standing in the international community and on our national security.\nSo as the President considers the options that are available to him inside of Syria, he's mindful of the need to think ahead and to look around the curve, and to think about the potential impact not just weeks or months in advance, but -- or not just weeks and months after a potential military invasion, for example, but rather to think about the years' long consequences of ordering an action like that.\nQ: I know you mentioned the Rezaian lawsuit earlier, and it's a private lawsuit, obviously. But I think people will find it interesting considering the suit, at least at glance, seems to be targeting a country, a sponsor of terror, and given the conversation that you and I have had about JASTA, do you think this is a direct reflection of that, and maybe in a positive way, at least in the case of the Rezaian family?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, I do think this is a good illustration. So I'm happy to have the opportunity to talk about this. What this situation illustrates is that U.S. citizens who have been the victim of a state sponsor of terrorism do have an avenue through the courts that they can pursue to be compensated for it. We have a mechanism in the U.S. government for holding state sponsors of terror accountable. And there is a standard that is set, based on an evaluation of the evidence by the executive branch, to label a particular country a state sponsor of terrorism.\nAnd that does have a variety of consequences. It serves to isolate that country from the international community. It subjects that country to significant financial sanctions that can take a toll on their economy. And it does give U.S. citizens who have been victimized by that terrorism an avenue to pursue to be compensated. I think that is an indication that we've got an effective mechanism in place for holding accountable state sponsors of terrorism.\nWith regard to JASTA, that was a piece of legislation and now a law that sought to target Saudi Arabia, a country that has not been designated a state sponsor of terrorism. It does open up a scenario where you have judges at a variety of levels and a variety of different courtrooms, reaching different conclusions about whether or not another country is complicit in sponsoring terrorism. That's not an effective way for us to confront state sponsors of terror. We should do so with a united front, and we should do so with penalties that are laid out in advance.\nThat's the system that we have. By rolling back that system, not only do we detract from the effective confrontation and forceful confrontation of state sponsors of terrorism, we also further degrade this principle of sovereign immunity that protects the United States of America more than any other country in the world.\nAnd the concerns that I've just laid out about this specific legislation are now concerns that Democrats and Republicans in Congress say they now share. It would have been helpful had they acted on those concerns before voting on the law -- either voting to approve it in the first place, or voting to override the President's veto. But we certainly are hopeful that Congress will act in bipartisan fashion to correct the significant problem that they have now created.\nQ: You mentioned Chief Judge Garland. What's happening with him right now? Is he in conversation with leaders on the Hill? Is he getting briefed by the White House? What happens during this long, protracted period between his nomination and obviously where we are today?\nMR. EARNEST: It has been a protracted period: 202 days he's been waiting since the President nominated him for him to be treated fairly by Republicans in the United States Senate. This is somebody that Republicans have not articulated a substantive objection to. He's somebody who received the highest rating from the nonpartisan American Bar Association. He's got more federal judicial experience than any other nominee in Supreme Court history. He's somebody that Republicans have described as a genuine consensus nominee.\nSo his treatment by Republicans in the United States Senate has been terrible. And he has met with some Republican members of the United States Senate. I believe that he's met with almost every member -- Democratic members of the Senate, if not every single one. He did have an opportunity, when the Senate was actually in town, to meet with some of the Democratic leaders just a couple of weeks ago. But, of course, he's not meeting with them today because they're not in session.\nBut, look, the President continues to make a case that he nominated the very best person to fill a vacancy in the Supreme Court, and he hopes that Chief Judge Garland will have an opportunity to serve this country with distinction on the United States Supreme Court. The President is confident that he would do so if given the opportunity.\nQ: Last one for me is the Assange story. Did the President hear about that? Did you watch sort of with any interest about last night, the Assange release of new information on WikiLeaks? Has that been an interest of yours at all?\nMR. EARNEST: It has not.\nMichelle.\nQ: So it doesn't sound like you think that Bill Clinton was overly critical in describing Obamacare as it stands now.\nMR. EARNEST: It's not exactly clear to me what argument he was making. And so I'll let him and his team explain it.\nQ: Whatever argument he was making, do you wish that he had used different words than \"crazy,\" and \"craziest thing in the world\"?\nMR. EARNEST: Of course. (Laughter.)\nQ: Just checking. Okay. And we talked a little bit about some of the things that Duterte has said. We've also seen his actions within his own country. Do those things alone do damage to the relationship between the U.S. and the Philippines?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, they certainly don't do anything to strengthen them. Fortunately, there is a long history of a steadfast alliance between the United States and the Philippines that stretches back some 70 years. It's rooted in our common values. It's rooted in the warm feelings that the citizens of our two countries have for one another. It's certainly rooted in the fact that there is a large Filipino-American population here in the United States that's interested in seeing warm relations between these two countries.\nBut it's a commitment to these shared values that prompts the United States to speak out so forcefully in raising concerns about reports of extrajudicial killings that have come at the behest of the Filipino government that's entirely inconsistent with the kinds of values that are the bedrock of our alliance. And that's why the President nor anybody else in the U.S. government is going to hesitate to raise these strong concerns.\nThe United States stands with the Filipino government and the Filipino people in helping them confront crime and narco-trafficking that has eroded the security situation in some parts of the country. We stand ready to support them, and we're going to continue to support them as they confront that threat. But we're going to insist that a commitment to human rights be maintained, if not strengthened.\nAnd there is an opportunity for the Filipino government to pursue a smart strategy to counter narco-trafficking and better protect the Filipino people while also protecting human rights. In fact, that is the responsibility of the government to do that. And they can count on the support of their allies in the United States if they're willing to do that. But these reports about extrajudicial killings coming at the behest of the Filipino government are deeply troubling.\nQ: Okay. And we talked a little bit about, yesterday, what's next after the ending of talks between the U.S. and Russia on Syria. And you said that the President is considering a range of options. So safe to say that that's what he's going to be discussing with Ash Carter this afternoon?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm sure it will be part of the discussion. The meeting that the President has with his Secretary of Defense today is part of the regularly scheduled meeting that he has with Secretary Carter when both men are in Washington, D.C. I'm confident this and other things will be on the agenda.\nAnd Secretary Carter's role has principally been focused on mobilizing U.S. military resources to provide to the counter-ISIL coalition that is applying such significant pressure to ISIL targets in Iraq and in Syria.\nThere have also been military assets that have been deployed against other extremist leaders in Syria, and the Department of Defense announced just yesterday that they had carried out a strike against one of the leading al Qaeda figures in Syria. This was an individual that was prominently featured in a video that was released by that organization earlier this year. The results of that strike have not been conclusively determined at this point. But the fact that the United States was able to carry out a strike against this individual is an indication of just how much pressure the United States is applying not just to leading ISIL figures in the context of our counter-ISIL coalition, but also to the kinds of extremist targets that we've been worried about inside of Syria since day one.\nYou'll recall, back in the summer of 2014, when the President first initiated military airstrikes against extremist targets in Syria, the targets of those strikes weren't just ISIL targets. There were other extremist targets that were hit in that raid. And that's an indication that from day one the United States has been very focused on countering the threat from al Qaeda that's emanating in Syria. ISIL is the organization that has succeeded in generating some attention for themselves, but we are also mindful of the threat that emanates from al Qaeda. And we're going to continue to be diligent in countering that threat. And I'm confident that will be a subject of some conversation today, too.\nQ: So what can you say about this range of options? And can you say that the possibility of strikes against certain regime targets is at least one option?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we have obviously been disappointed, as I expressed yesterday, that the Russians proved either unwilling or unable to exercise the kind of influence with the Assad regime that they hoped they would use to reduce violence and allow for humanitarian assistance to flow to those in need.\nBased on that Russian failure, it's apparent there's not a whole lot more for us to discuss with them bilaterally. So we need to consider what other diplomatic options are available to us to try to address the root cause of the situation inside of Syria.\nSo there are a variety of channels that we can use. The first is supporting and facilitating the continued efforts of the U.N. Special Envoy, Mr. de Mistura, who is working to try to facilitate negotiations that would reduce violence there.\nThere is this International Syria Support Group that's been stood up by a variety of countries, including Russia, who are concerned about the situation there and believe that, working together with countries throughout the region and around the world, that our shared interests can be addressed. So the United States will certainly work through that channel.\nWe also know that there are a number of other bilateral relationships in the region that we have with other countries who are concerned about the situation there, and there may be an opportunity for the United States to work bilaterally through some of those channels to try to address some of the concerns that we have about the increasing violence and the need to expedite the provision of humanitarian assistance to civilian populations there.\nSo there are a variety of diplomatic options that we will pursue. These are all options we have been pursuing, just to be clear about it, but we're obviously going to have to redouble our efforts in those channels because the Russians have failed to live up to the commitments that they made in the context of that bilateral channel.\nQ: So when you talk about the President looking at this range of options, those were all diplomatic options that you were talking about?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, when you consider what our approach has been to Syria from the beginning, our approach has been to use our military and intelligence might, in coordination with our counter-ISIL coalition partners, to apply significant pressure to ISIL's leadership, to apply pressure to their capitals, and to support forces on the ground who can retake territory from ISIL. That's been the core focus of our military strategy in Iraq and in Syria. And those efforts have been important to enhancing the national security of the United States and our allies.\nAnd again, the fact that we took this strike against an al Qaeda target just yesterday I think is the latest indication that that effort that's underway against extremists, militarily inside of Iraq and in Syria, is vigorous.\nAt the same time, we have acknowledged -- also from day one -- that there is no military solution to the chaos and violence inside of Syria. The United States and the international community will not be able to impose a solution on the situation, and the solution that we settle on will not be military -- will not be a military one alone. What even the Russians acknowledge that a political transition inside of Syria must take place because it is simply not possible for a leader like Bashar al-Assad to continue to govern Syria. He has engaged in a reign of terror over the last five or six years against his own people, using barrel bombs, using cluster munitions and other terrible tactics to attack innocent civilians -- to kill children, to bomb these populations into submission. It's disgusting. It's horrifying what we've seen.\nAnd that is exactly why it's impossible for President Assad or any of his supporters to make the case that he can effectively reunite and govern Syria.\nSo the United States is going to work diplomatically through all the channels that I described to try to bring about a reduction in violence, enhanced provision of humanitarian assistance, and facilitate in political talks that will allow for that transition to take place. That's the only way we're going to succeed in addressing the root cause of the chaos in Syria and ultimately address our most urgent national security concerns about what's been taking place there.\nQ: You're saying that, potentially, strikes against regime targets would sort of ruin that goal of working this out diplomatically and longer term? Or strikes like what we just described -- is that at least an option that's being discussed?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I'm not going to get into all the things that are being discussed by the President and his national security team. What I will say, though, is the President continues to be mindful of the absolute need to think through the consequences of deploying various options. There's a risk associated with taking strikes at regime targets. That risk includes attacking a regime that does continue to maintain a robust air defense system. It also edges U.S. and Russian military forces closer to confrontation. That doesn't serve anybody's interest.\nSo I'm certainly not going to stand here and take anything off the table when it comes to the decisions that the Commander-in-Chief can use to protect our interests around the world, particularly in a place as dangerous as Syria. But the President, as he thinks through those options, is going to think very carefully about the consequences of taking individual actions. And that's just one example.\nAnd I think it's why that for all of the public concern and even criticism that we've seen directed at the President of the United States about the situation in Syria, we haven't seen the suggestion of specific alternatives. Everybody is heartbroken about the innocent loss of life in Syria, even across party lines. But for all the criticism that is put forward, principally by Republicans, we haven't seen realistic or constructive proposed alternatives that would actually address the concerns that they claim to have.\nQ: Thanks, Josh.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay. John.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. On September 16th, in answer to my question about Congressman Babin of Texas's letter, saying that it would be a danger to let more refugees in the United States, you said that the national security experts he cited in writing his letter were people that probably gave themselves that title, and questioned their credentials. The following Monday, he gave reporters a list of quotes from FBI Director Comey, from Jim Clapper, and from Secretary of Homeland Security Johnson, all warning that more people coming from that region would be dangerous to the United States. Your response to that.\nMR. EARNEST: I don't think that is at all an accurate representation of their views. But you should go ask each of them and find out.\nQ: I will. The other thing is, the President has had a very good relationship with Donald Cardinal Wuerl of the Archdiocese of Washington. He's met at the White House with him a number of times over the years. It was noted on Sunday that since the John Carroll Society has had the Red Mass honoring the judiciary here in Washington since 1953, President Obama is the first President who never came to a mass in all his eight years in office. Is there any reason for that, or is it just a matter of his schedule?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any specific reason why the President hasn't attended, so I assume it's a scheduling situation. But we're happy to take a look at it for you.\nQ: Thank you, Josh.\nMR. EARNEST: All right. Pam.\nQ: Josh, Senator McConnell said last week again that the Supreme Court seat would be filled by the next President. If, in a little over a month from now, Hillary Clinton is elected, do you have any hope that they will act on Garland's nomination? And if Donald Trump is elected, would Senate Republicans be justified in holding up any of his nominees?\nMR. EARNEST: You mean Senate Democrats?\nQ: Yes.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me -- a couple of relevant facts here. Even Senator Flake, who I think, to his credit, articulated rather concisely the concerns that we have expressed about this situation -- Senator Flake was quoted in the Daily Beast saying, \"Our position shouldn't be that the next President ought to decide. Nobody really believes that, because if this were the last year of a Republican presidency, nobody would say that.\" Now, presumably, he was saying nobody who was a Republican would say that.\nThat is a pretty clear distillation of the administration's concerns with the way that Republicans have infused partisan politics into the federal judiciary. Republicans are now essentially making the case that the only Supreme Court nominees they can support are the ones nominated by a Republican President. That's not historically how this situation has worked. Our country, in fact, has been well-served by efforts among leaders in both parties to try to prevent partisan politics from infecting the process of confirming justices to the Supreme Court.\nEven Democrats, when faced with a similar situation, they were being asked -- Democrats were at the majority in the United States Senate. They were being asked by a Republican President in his eighth year in office to confirm his nominee to the Supreme Court, in an election year. And those Senate Democrats came forward and voted to confirm Justice Kennedy in 1988. It wasn't just a couple of Democrats that came around and decided to do the right thing. Every Democrat came around, considered Justice Kennedy's track record, and even though he was nominated by a President in the other party, they voted to confirm him because they believed he would serve on the Supreme Court with honor and distinction. And I think many, if not every observer of the Supreme Court would conclude that that's exactly what Justice Kennedy has done. And I say that even as somebody who hasn't agreed with every decision that he's handed down.\nWhat I will say is that this does raise significant concerns about the establishment of a new precedent. Senator Lindsay Graham earlier this year acknowledged in a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee that to treat Chief Judge Garland so unfairly is to establish a new precedent, and that does -- it's not a good one. And I don't think Senator Graham was referring to it as a good precedent.\nSo hopefully the question that you have posed is not one that we will have to consider, but the President is certainly hopeful that, at some point, people like Senator McConnell will move away from the position of spending their seven-week vacation bragging about not doing their job and actually start to focus on the best interests of the country. And the country is best served by having somebody like Chief Judge Merrick Garland, the most experienced Supreme Court nominee in American history, confirmed to the Supreme Court where he can protect the liberty and freedom of every single American.\nQ: So how much damage has been done to the process by this?\nMR. EARNEST: The process has been deeply damaged. Chief Judge Garland has been waiting 202 days to even get a hearing from the Senate. Democrats have been uniformly supportive of him getting a hearing, so we know where the blame lies -- and it lies with Republicans, just to be clear. And what Senator Flake indicated is correct, that the concerns that have been expressed about Chief Judge Garland are rooted solely in the fact that he was appointed by a Democrat President. And if nominees are -- if the only criteria for evaluating nominees is looking at the party identification of the President who nominated them, then we're essentially going to have a partisan judiciary. And that's not going to enhance people's confidence that they're going to be treated fairly by the judiciary, regardless of their own partisan identity.\nIf judgment about laws is reduced to the evaluation of people not wearing black robes, but red and blue robes, that's going to change the nature of our justice system, and not in a positive way. So I think the President is hopeful that there will be course correction implemented, probably not under Leader McConnell's watch. He's the one that's broken the system. But the President is hopeful that it is one that can be fixed. And if it is, it is something that I think will send an important message to the American people about how our laws, even at the highest level, are applied without regard to partisan affiliation.\nQ: And on another subject, do you expect the Paris climate deal to be officially -- become official this week in terms of the 55 countries signing on?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have an update in terms of timing. What we have said is that we expect that this is an agreement that would go into force before the end of the year. And I know that there is some reporting out of Europe indicating that a substantial commitment would be made to the agreement there that would allow the agreement to go into force, but I don't want to get ahead of any announcements that need to be made by individual countries as they consider fulfilling the commitments that they've made in the context of those negotiations.\nQ: And how significant will that be in terms of the overall fight against climate change?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, it would be historic. And the President has talked about how this is the first time that we've seen 190 countries come together and make a series of significant commitments to fight climate change. What's also significant is these kinds of multilateral agreements that are negotiated under the auspices of the U.N. typically take multiple years, if not decades, to enter into force. And the fact that this agreement will take effect in less than a year is not just a historic accomplishment, it's a historic commitment to fulfilling the terms of the deal in a way that will have enormous positive benefits for the planet.\nNow, the President has also been clear that this agreement is merely a first step. But it's important because it codifies a structure that commits countries every five years to making new commitments about steps that they can do to more effectively and more comprehensively fight carbon pollution. So initiating this process is enormously important. And the fact that it is on track to take effect less than a year after being negotiated I think bodes well for the long-term impact that this agreement can have to protecting the planet.\nGregory, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thank you. Reuters is reporting that Yahoo! began last year complying with some kind of a classified directive ordering it to turn over to the National Security Agency specific inbound emails using certain keywords. I guess my question to you is, given the scope and the ramifications of that, are those kinds of directives, be it a national security letter, a FISA Court order or whatever, something that the President of the United States would be aware of, would sign off on? Can you kind of give us -- tell us what the protocol is in the post -- era for what the White House, perhaps through the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, or National Security Council or something, to do some oversight of the sweeping orders, ordering private information of citizens to the National Security Council [sic]?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Gregory, let me start out by saying I have not seen the Reuters report that you're referring to. And given the fact that it apparently makes reference to a classified document of one kind or another, even if I were aware of it I probably would not be in a position to comment on it.\nBut in the spirit of your question, let me just say that the President, over the course of his two terms in office, has been committed to implementing a series of reforms that more effectively balance the country's national security needs with the privacy rights of American citizens. And the President, when he took office, expressed some concern that the privacy and civil liberties of some Americans were not given enough weight in some of the decisions made by the previous administration. And it's taken time throughout the eight years of the Obama presidency to understand the consequences of those decisions and to implement needed reforms to protect the privacy and civil liberties of the American people.\nAt each turn, the President has been mindful of the need to protect our national security. And the kinds of reforms that the President considered were focused on making sure that our intelligence professionals and our law enforcement professionals and our military professionals had the tools they need to keep us safe, even as we protect the civil liberties of American citizens.\nBut I'll have somebody follow up with you, Gregory, on the specific report and see if there's more information that we can provide that may be relevant to this.\nSince the President's travel tomorrow has been changed, I'll see you all here tomorrow. Thanks.\nQ: Josh, what's he doing all day besides Ash Carter?\nMR. EARNEST: The President has got a series of meetings, but in anticipation of his busy and late day tomorrow, the President had a lighter than usual schedule. But I guess the one other thing that I didn't point out that I probably should point out here is the other thing that has been added to the President's schedule tomorrow is he will travel to FEMA Headquarters here in Washington. It just occurred to me -- talking about the President's schedule, I failed to --\nQ: You buried the lead.\nTHE PRESIDENT: (Laughter.) I did bury the lead. My apologies. You'll have to do a write-through, or whatever it is you guys do here.\nBut the President will be going to FEMA Headquarters tomorrow. He will get a briefing from FEMA officials. I don't know yet whether or not FEMA Administrator Fugate will be at headquarters tomorrow. But if he is, he will be the one who will be delivering the briefing to President Obama. There will be representatives from a variety of federal agencies who are mobilizing efforts to response to potential impacts of Hurricane Matthew. So the President will get an update on the weather forecast, and he'll also be updated on the operational aspects of preparing for potential impacts of the storm. He'll also have an opportunity to thank some of the professionals at FEMA who are manning the response center who have already worked some really long hours in advance of the storm to prepare for the potential impact and ensure that sufficient federal resources can be mobilized to meet urgent needs in those communities that are affected.\nSo you'll hear from the President about this tomorrow.\nQ: In the morning?\nTHE PRESIDENT: I'm not sure of the timing yet on the schedule. We're still -- we had to overhaul the whole schedule because of the last-minute change. But we'll let you know before the end of the day when that will take place. Obviously, we know you'll have keen interest in covering all that. And then, at some point either before or after the President does that event, we'll do a briefing here.\nQ: Josh, was it Director Fugate that briefed President Obama today?\nTHE PRESIDENT: The update that the President received today was from Lisa Monaco, who is his homeland security advisor. But Ms. Monaco is in regular tough with senior officials at DHS, including Administrator Fugate. So I know that she's been getting updates from them on preparations for the storm.\nThanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 2:09 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2016-10-04", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}
{"author": "Michelle Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=120917", "text": "MRS. OBAMA: Well, hello, Charlotte! (Applause.) How's everybody doing? (Applause.) Ya'll fired up, ready to make this happen?\nAUDIENCE: Yes!\nMRS. OBAMA: Well, let me say, I am beyond thrilled to be here today to support the next President and Vice President of the United States -- Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine! (Applause.)\nBut before we get into things, I just want to take a moment to thank your Attorney General and soon-to-be Governor, Roy Cooper, for that wonderful introduction. (Applause.)\nAnd I want to recognize a few more people as well -- Congresswoman Alma Adams, who is here. (Applause.) Your candidate for Lieutenant Governor, Linda Coleman. (Applause.) And of course, I want to thank all of you for being here, taking the time out of your busy days. (Applause.)\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: I love you!\nMRS. OBAMA: I love you, too! (Applause.) It's good to be back in North Carolina, and it's a beautiful day with a beautiful room full of people.\nAnd I have been so nostalgic campaigning. Can you believe I'm campaigning again? (Laughter and applause.) But I'm happy to be out here because this is the last time, and I can't believe that it's almost Election Day -- we're getting there, folks! (Applause.) And we're coming to the end of our time, my family's time, in the White House.\nAUDIENCE: Awww --\nMRS. OBAMA: As I've said, it's fine! It's fine because we've got a good replacement in Hillary Clinton, so we'll be good. (Applause.) But as I've been traveling around campaigning, I've just been sharing how this time is a little -- I'm mixed about this time. It's a little bittersweet because we are experiencing a time of great transition for me and Barack and Malia and Sasha and Bo and Sunny and Grandma -- all of us -- (laughter) as we figure out what we're going to do next.\nI've got to get my husband to work. I'm going to need a job, but it will be a job out of politics. And my husband has got to get a job -- somebody has got to hire that man. (Laughter and applause.) They're making us move, so we're getting a new house. (Laughter.) We have to pack up the old house and, as Barack says, we've got to make sure we get our security deposit back, so we're working on that. (Laughter and applause.)\nBut as it is a great time of transition for our family, I know it's a great time of transition for the entire country as we decide who our next President is going to be. And times like these can be difficult -- we're feeling it, right? There's a lot of anxiety, a lot of uncertainty, and that's natural. We saw that in 2008. When Barack was first elected, I reminded people that there were folks who had plenty of questions about what kind of President Barack would be. They wondered, would he understand us? Rightly, they wanted to know, would he protect us?\nBut then of course, there were those who had different questions. Questions that they continued to ask for the past eight years -- whether Barack was born in this country. As I've said, these questions are hurtful, deceitful and they were designed to deliberately undermine his presidency. And I want to remind people, these are questions that cannot be blamed on others; they cannot be swept under the rug with an insincere sentence at a press conference.\nAnd I think that during his time in office, my husband has answered those questions with the example he's set and the dignity he has shown. (Applause.) By always going high when they go low -- (applause) -- and he has answered those questions with the progress that we have all achieved together. Progress like passing health reform, creating millions of jobs, slashing the unemployment rate, lifting millions of people out of poverty, expanding LGBT rights so marriage equality is now the law of the land. (Applause.) I could go on and on and on. (Applause.)\nBut even after all this progress, it is understandable that folks are feeling a little uncertain as we face this next transition. So the question now before us all is: How do we sort through all the negativity, all the name-calling that we've been experiencing and choose the right person to lead our country forward?\nWell, I'm out here because I'm sharing what I think is a unique perspective that I have. As someone who has seen the presidency up close and personal, I want to share with you what I have learned about this job, watching it every day for the last seven and a half years.\nFirst and foremost, this job is very hard. I have said it again and again -- it is the highest-stakes, most 24/7 job you can possibly imagine. The issues that cross a President's desk are never easy. He doesn't get the easy questions. The solutions to persistent, systemic challenges are never black and white.\nI mean, just think about the crises that Barack has faced just these last eight years. In his first term alone, Barack had to rescue our economy from the worst crisis since the Great Depression. (Applause.) He had to make the call to take out Osama bin Laden. (Applause.) He's had to respond to devastating natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and so much more.\nSo, when it comes to the qualifications that we should demand of our President, to start with, we need someone who will take the job seriously. (Applause.) And that means we need someone who will actually study and prepare so that they understand the issues better than anyone else on their team. (Applause.)\nAnd trust me, we need someone with superb judgment in their own right. Because, yes, a President can hire the best advisors on Earth, but let me tell you, five advisors will give five different opinions. And the President -- and the President alone -- always has to make the final call.\nWe also need someone who is steady and measured, because when making life or death, war or peace decisions, a President can't just pop off or lash out irrationally. And I think we can all agree that someone who's roaming around at 3 a.m. tweeting should not have their fingers on the nuclear codes. (Applause.)\nWe need someone who is honest and plays by the rules, because not paying taxes for years and years while the rest of us pay our fair share doesn't make you smarter than the rest of us. (Applause.) No, we need a President who will choose to do what's best for the country, even when it doesn't personally benefit them. (Applause.)\nAnd finally, we need a President who's compassionate, and who truly cares about all our families; someone who will help us take on the hard issues our communities face not just with slogans about law and order, but with real solutions to heal our divisions -- here in Charlotte and all across this country. (Applause.)\nSo, at the end of the day, as I've said again and again, the presidency doesn't change who you are -- it reveals who you are. (Applause.) And the same is true of a presidential campaign. U.S. presidential campaigns are very long -- nearly two years or half of one presidential term -- which gives voters a chance to get to know and observe a candidate's behavior over a meaningful period of time. So if a candidate traffics in prejudice, fear and lies on the campaign trail, if a candidate mocks people with disabilities or folks who are sick, if a candidate implies that veterans who served our country so bravely are somehow weak because they're dealing with the wounds of war, if a candidate regularly demeans and humiliates women -- making cruel and insulting comments about our bodies, criticizing how we look and how we act -- well, sadly, that's who that candidate really is. That's the kind of President they will be. And trust me, a candidate is not going to suddenly change once they're in office.\nJust the opposite, in fact, because the minute that individual takes that oath, they are under the hottest, harshest light there is and there's no way to hide who they really are.\nBut see, at that point, it's too late. They're the leader of the world's largest economy, the Commander-in-Chief of the most powerful military force on Earth. With every word they utter, they can start wars, crash markets, fundamentally change the course of our planet.\nSo, who in this election is truly ready for this job?\nAUDIENCE: Hillary!\nMRS. OBAMA: Well, I agree. (Applause.) For me, there is only one candidate in this race who we can trust with those responsibilities; only one person with the qualifications and temperament for this job; and that person is our friend, Hillary Clinton, without a doubt. (Applause.) Without a doubt. We know that Hillary's the right person because we've seen her character and commitment -- not just during the campaign, but over the course of her entire life. (Applause.)\nWe've seen her dedication to public service -- how after law school, she became an advocate for kids with disabilities. She fought for children's health care as First Lady, for quality child care as a senator. And when she didn't become President in 2008, Hillary didn't just throw in the towel. No, she once again answered the call to serve and earned sky-high approval ratings. She earned sky-high approval ratings as our Secretary of State. (Applause.)\nAnd for those who question her stamina to be President, Hillary's resilience is more than proven. As she said in the debate last week, she's the only candidate in this race who has traveled to 112 countries, who has negotiated a ceasefire, a peace agreement, a release of dissidents; who's spent 11 hours testifying before a congressional committee. (Applause.)\nHillary Clinton is tough. See, I've watched her -- when she gets knocked down, she doesn't complain. She doesn't cry foul. No, she gets right back up and comes back stronger for the people who need her most. (Applause.)\nAnd let's not forget that Hillary is one of the few people on this entire planet -- and clearly the only person in this race -- who has any idea what this job entails -- (applause) -- the staggering stakes, the brutal hours, the overwhelming stresses. See, and this is the beauty of it. She knows this, and yet, she's still willing to do this job. (Laughter and applause.) See, because Hillary was raised to believe that she has an obligation to use her talents to help as many people as possible. And that is why she's running. See, now, for me, that's dedication. That's what love of country looks like. (Applause.) So when I hear folks saying that they're just not feeling inspired in this election, I really have to disagree.\nBecause right now, we have an opportunity to elect one of the most qualified people who has ever endeavored to become President: Hillary -- I remind people -- Hillary has been a lawyer, a law professor, First Lady of Arkansas, First Lady of the United States, a U.S. Senator, Secretary of State. (Applause.) See, Charlotte, that is why I am inspired by Hillary. That's why I'm here. I'm inspired by her persistence and consistency. I'm inspired by her heart and her guts. And I'm inspired by her lifelong record of service. (Applause.)\nNo one in our lifetime has ever had as much experience and exposure to the presidency -- not Barack, not Bill, nobody. And, yes, she just happens to be a woman. (Applause.) So, with someone who has experienced this, trust me -- experience matters. Preparation matters. Temperament matters. And Hillary Clinton has it all. (Applause.)\nShe is the real deal, and I have come to know her very well over the years. And I know that she is more than ready, more than able to be an outstanding President for us all. So we cannot afford to squander this opportunity, particularly given the alternative. Because we know that being President isn't anything like reality TV -- this is not an apprenticeship. It's about whether someone can handle the awesome responsibility of leading this country.\nSo really take the time and think about this. As you prepare to make this decision -- and this decision is yours -- I urge you to ignore the chatter and the noise and ask yourselves: Which candidate really has the experience, the maturity and the temperament to handle this awesomely hard job? Which candidate's words and actions speak to the values we share -- values like inclusion, opportunity, sacrifice for others. See, because your answers to these questions on Election Day will determine who sits in the Oval Office after Barack Obama.\nAnd I want to be very clear: Elections are not just about who votes, but who doesn't. (Applause.) So for any of you who might be thinking that your one vote doesn't really matter, or that one person can't really make a difference, I want you to consider this -- and I share this with everyone I go because it's the same every election -- every election -- not just the presidency. But back in 2008, Barack won North Carolina by about 14,000 votes -- (applause) -- and that sounds like a lot, but when you break that number down, the difference between winning and losing this state was a little over two votes per precinct. Do you hear that? (Laughter.) If just two or three folks per precinct had gone the other way or stayed at home, Barack would have lost this state. But then, let's not forget what happened in 2012 -- Barack actually did lose this state by about 17 votes per precinct.\nSo I just want you all to think about -- everybody in this room who didn't vote, everybody who didn't pick up the phone, who thought, I didn't feel good, I forgot, I didn't talk to my mother, didn't pick her up, it didn't matter, what does it matter? It matters. Do you hear me? It matters. (Applause.) So the fact is that each of you just in this hall could swing an entire precinct and win this election for Hillary just by getting yourselves, your friends, your family -- that's it -- out to vote. Just take care of you. Find a neighbor, find a friend. You could win this. (Applause.)\nBut you could also help swing an entire precinct for Hillary's opponent with a protest vote -- don't play with that -- (laughter) -- or by staying home out of frustration. Because here's the truth: Hillary Clinton or her opponent will be elected President this year. And if you vote for someone other than Hillary -- or if you don't vote at all -- then you are helping to elect her opponent. (Applause.) And the stakes are far too high to take that chance.\nRemember, it's not about voting for the perfect candidate -- there is no such thing. Candidates happen to be human. In this election, it's about making a choice between two very different candidates with very different visions for our nation. So the question is: Do you want Hillary Clinton to be your President or do you want her opponent to be your President?\nAUDIENCE: Hillary! (Applause.)\nMRS. OBAMA: If you choose Hillary, like I do, then we have to get to work because it's not enough to just come to a rally, post selfies. I mean, elections are still about rolling up your sleeves. It's not enough to get angry and just speak about the change -- we all need to take action. And being here is an important first step, but we've got to take action to elect folks who will stand with us to make that change.\nSo we need you to leave here with all the energy and get yourself -- and everyone you know -- registered to vote today. (Applause.) And we're fortunate because the Clinton campaign is highly organized, so there are a number of volunteers here today who can help. I want you, if you are not registered, find them and get registered before you leave. You can also go to IWillVote.com for all our young people who do this -- (laughter) -- so you can check your registration status and you can also get registered to vote there as well.\nAnd then we need you to roll up your sleeves, make calls, think about that two votes -- every call you make, every door you knock on, 17 votes. Think about that to get folks out on Election Day. You and you alone can turn this race. (Applause.) And, again, you can sign up again with Hillary campaign folks who are here today. I want to see the numbers here. See, one of the things that gets me going is that when I leave a rally and folks really sign up -- see, I call and go, what'd they do? Where they listening? (Laughter.) And then I get some numbers and I'm like, yes! They were listening! (Applause.) So don't embarrass me, ya'll. (Laughter and applause.)\nAs you all are working your hearts off for Hillary, if you start to feel tired and discouraged by all the negative in this election, if you just want to hide under the bed and come out when it's all over, I will leave you just reminding you what's at stake. The choice you make on November the 8th could determine whether young people can afford their college tuition; whether folks will have the health care they need for themselves and their families. It will determine whether we close tax loop holes that allow billionaires to game the system at the expense of working folks. (Applause.) On November the 8th, you will decide whether we have a President who believes in science and will combat climate change -- or not. (Applause.) You will decide whether we have a President who will honor our proud history as a nation of immigrants -- or not. (Applause.) A President who thinks that women deserve the right to make their own choices about our bodies and our health -- or not. (Applause.) You will decide that. That's what's at stake -- just a sliver or what's at stake.\nSo we cannot afford to be tired or turned off. Not now. Because while this might feel like a time of great uncertainty and division, I just want to remind you, I have never felt more hopeful about the future of this great nation -- never. And I feel this way because for the past eight years, I have had the great honor of traveling from one end of our country to the other. And I have met people from every conceivable background and walk of life. And time and again, I've seen proof of what Barack and I have always believed in our hearts -- that we, as Americans, are fundamentally decent people. Every last one of us. And we all truly want the same things. We really do. (Applause.)\nTime and again, Barack and I have met people who disagree with just about everything we've ever said, but they still welcome us, warmly, into their communities -- folks who are open-hearted and willing to listen. And while we might not always change each other's minds, we always walk away reminded that we're just not all that different. I just wish everyone could see that.\nMillions of folks in this country are working long hours to send their kids to college, just like my mom and dad did. They're helping to raise their grandkids, just like Barack's grandparents did for him. They're teaching their kids the exact same values that Barack and I are teaching our girls -- that you work hard for what you want in life; you don't take shortcuts; you treat people with respect, even if they don't look or think like you. (Applause.) That when someone is struggling, you don't turn away, and you certainly don't take advantage of them. No, you imagine walking a mile in their shoes -- empathy. I mean, you do what you can to help.\nSo I remind people, in this election -- especially our young people -- don't ever let anyone take away your hope. Hope matters. (Applause.) Because that's what we do in America -- a country where a girl like me from the South Side of Chicago, whose great, great grandfather was a slave can go to the finest universities on Earth. (Applause.) A country where a biracial kid from Hawaii, who is the son of a single mother, can become President. (Applause.) A country that has always been a beacon for people who have come to our shores and poured their hopes, and their prayers, and their backbreaking hard work into making us who we are today. (Applause.) That is what makes America great. (Applause.)\nAnd North Carolina, we deserve a President who can see those truths in all of us. A President who believes that each of us is part of the American story and we are always stronger together. (Applause.) A President who will bring out the best in us -- our kindness, our decency, our courage, our determination -- so we can keep perfecting our union and passing down those blessings of liberty to our kids, who are watching.\nHillary Clinton will be that President. (Applause.) And I am confident -- I would not be here if I didn't believe that. You all know me well enough to know over these years that I do things that I believe in. I don't have to be here. (Applause.) I am here because I care about this country, and I care about every last one of our citizens in it, and I care about our kids. (Applause.) Hillary Clinton is that President. So from now until November, all of us -- we need to do everything we can to help her and Tim Kaine win this election. (Applause.)\nSo as I leave you, Charlotte, and go on to Raleigh, my question is, are you all with me?\nAUDIENCE: Yes!\nMRS. OBAMA: Are we fired up? (Applause.) You all in this room can make the difference, but you've got to get to work. Are we ready to roll up our sleeves and get to work? (Applause.) Well, I'm going to be right there with you.\nThank you all. God bless.

(Applause.) Wow, how are you all doing? (Applause.) Good, me too. I am -- well, you all have got me all pumped up! I'm so excited to be here. (Applause.)\nI don't know about you, but I am here to support the next President and Vice President of the United States -- Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine. (Applause.)\nBut let me do a few things first. I want to start by --\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Happy anniversary!\nMRS. OBAMA: Thank you. Happy anniversary -- sad. (Applause.) Yes, me and Barack just celebrated our 24th wedding anniversary yesterday. (Applause.) Thank you, guys. (Applause.)\nBut let me first thank Kaitlin, because she is a phenomenal representative of this school. I know that she speaks for all of you because she is amazing, hardworking, articulate, beautiful, well-dressed, well-mannered. (Applause.) So I want to thank Kaitlin for that wonderful introduction -- it takes a lot to come out here and talk to all you with all this excitement, so she did a phenomenal job. (Applause.)\nI also want to recognize a few other people -- your candidate for U.S. Senate, Deborah Ross, is here. (Applause.) And I want to recognize Congressmen Butterfield and Price -- I know Congressman Price is here. (Applause.) And your former Governor, Governor Hunt and First Lady Hunt -- former First Lady Hunt. (Applause.)\nBut I have to say that I have to thank all of you here at NC State for coming out! (Applause.) Oh my goodness, thank you! (Applause.)\nSo I'm back on the campaign trail -- wow, who would have thought? It is hard to believe that we are so close to Election Day. And as I've been sharing with people as I've been going around the campaign trail, we're almost at the end of our time, our family, at the White House. (Applause.) It's okay. It's okay. Because we've got --\nAUDIENCE: Four more years! Four more years!\nMRS. OBAMA: The President gets two terms, eight years, that's our democracy, it's a good thing. It's a good thing. But our job -- we have to replace with a good next family, and that's why we're here. (Applause.) But I've been sharing with people that this time is bittersweet for me. This is going to be the last time I campaign.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: I love you!\nMRS. OBAMA: I love you all, too. I love you all so much. I do. (Applause.) I do. I love you all more than you will know. Don't get me crying up here because I will do that. (Applause.)\nBut this is really a time of great transition for me and Barack and the girls and my mom and Bo and Sunny. (Laughter.) As I've been saying, I'm really trying to make sure that my husband finds a new job so he's not sitting around the house. (Laughter.) I'm going to find a new job, so if you guys have been working on your rйsumйs, you'll be able to give me some tips. NC State may be hiring -- we'll take a look. (Applause.)\nBut we've got to move out of our house -- you know, that White House? We've got to move out, we've got to pack it up, make sure it's clean for the next occupants so we don't lose our security deposit. (Laughter.) So we've got a lot going on. So we're kind of dealing with all of this. But I know that this isn't just a time of transition for my family, but for our entire country as we decide who our next President will be. And transitions like this are difficult, because they involve a lot of uncertainty. And we saw that back in 2008 when Barack was first elected. Some of you may be too young to remember because I'm looking at you all, and you all are so young. (Laughter.) So many of you.\nBut back then, I don't know if you remember, but people had all kinds of questions about what kind of President Barack would be. Things like, would he understand us? Would he protect us? (Applause.) But as I am -- want to remind people that there were also those who had other kinds of questions -- questions they continued to ask for the past eight years, like whether Barack was born in this country.\nAUDIENCE: Booo --\nMRS. OBAMA: And I make a point to point this out because these questions were hurtful. They were deceitful. They were deliberately designed to undermine my husband's presidency. And they are questions that cannot be blamed on others. They can't be swept under the rug -- I'm certainly not sweeping anything under the rug. (Laughter and applause.) But during this time in the White House, I think that Barack has answered those questions with the example he has set and the dignity he has shown by going high when they go low. (Applause.)\nBut more importantly, I think he's answered those questions with the progress that we all achieved together. Progress like passing health reform; creating millions of new jobs and slashing the unemployment rate; lifting millions out of poverty; expanding LGBT rights so marriage equality is now the law of the land. (Applause.) I could go on, but even after all this progress, it is understandable that folks are feeling a little uncertain as we face the next transition. So the question is, how do we sort through all of the negativity, all the name-calling in this election and choose the right person to lead our country?\nBut one of the reasons why I'm out here -- and I wanted to be out here -- was because I have a unique perspective on the presidency. I have seen it up close and personal for seven and a half years, and I've learned a lot about what it takes to do this job. First and foremost, this job is hard. It is really hard. It is the highest stakes, most 24/7 job you can possibly imagine. The issues that cross a President's desk are never easy. The easy questions don't even get to the President. Solutions to persistent, systemic challenges are never black and white.\nJust think about the crises Barack has faced these past eight years. In his first term alone, he had to rescue our economy from the worst crisis since the Great Depression. (Applause.) He had to make the call to take out Osama bin Laden. (Applause.) He's had to respond to devastating natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and so much more. So, when it comes to the qualifications we should demand in a President, to start with, we need someone who will take the job seriously. (Applause.) Someone who will study and prepare so that they understand the issues better than anyone else on their team. (Applause.) We need someone with superb judgement in their own right, because yes, a President can hire the best advisors on Earth, but I guarantee you this: Five advisors will give five different opinions. And it is the President -- and the President alone -- who always makes the final call. We also need someone who is steady and measured, because when you're making life or death, war or peace decisions, a President cannot just pop off or lash out irrationally. (Applause.) He can't do it. (Applause.)\nAnd I just have to say this: I think we all agree that someone who is roaming around at 3 a.m. tweeting should not have their fingers on the nuclear codes. (Applause.) We need someone who is honest and plays by the rules because not paying taxes for years and years while the rest of us pay our fair share -- (applause) -- see, that does not make you smarter than the rest of us. We need a President who will choose to do what's best for the country, even when it doesn't personally benefit them. (Applause.)\nFinally, we need a President who is compassionate -- someone who truly cares about our families. Someone who will help us take on the hard issues our communities face not just with slogans about law and order, but with real solutions to heal our divisions -- here in North Carolina and all across this country. Because at the end of the day, as I've said before and I will say it again and again until Election Day, the presidency does not change who you are -- it reveals who you are. (Applause.)\nAnd trust me, the same thing is true of a presidential campaign. U.S. presidential campaigns are very long -- nearly two years, or half of one entire presidential term, which gives voters a chance to get to know and observe a candidate's behavior over a meaningful period of time. So if a candidate traffics in prejudice, fear and lies on the campaign trail, if a candidate mocks people with disabilities or people who are sick, if a candidate implies that our veterans who have served our country so bravely are somehow weak because they're dealing with the wounds of war -- (applause) -- if a candidate regularly demeans and humiliates women -- (applause) -- making cruel and insulting comments about our bodies, criticizing how we look and how we act -- see, well, sadly, that's who that candidate really is. (Applause.) And that is -- that's the kind of President they will be. So trust me, a candidate is not going to suddenly change once they're in office.\nSee, just the opposite, because the minute that individual takes that oath, they are under the hottest, harshest light there is and there's nowhere to hide who they really are. See, but at that point, it's too late. They're the leader of the world's largest economy. They're Commander-in-Chief of the most powerful military force on Earth. With every word they utter, they can start wars, crash markets, fundamentally change the course of our planet.\nSo, the question we all have to honestly ask ourselves: Who in this election is truly ready for this job?\nAUDIENCE: Hillary! (Applause.)\nMRS. OBAMA: I am obviously here because it is crystal clear to me that there's only one person in this race we can trust with those responsibilities; only one person with the qualifications and temperament for this job; and that person is our friend, Hillary Clinton. (Applause.) So here's why I believe that. And trust me, I don't campaign for just anybody. (Laughter.) See, we know that Hillary's the right person because we've seen her character and commitment not just during this campaign, but over the course of her entire life. (Applause.)\nWe've seen her dedication to public service -- how after law school -- and a lot of students will understand this -- she became an advocate for kids with disabilities. That's what she did with her law degree. (Applause.) She fought for children's health care as First Lady, and for quality child care as a senator. And this is the thing about Hillary: When she didn't become President in 2008, she didn't throw in the towel. No, she once again answered the call to serve and earned sky-high approval ratings. Let me say that again: She earned sky-high approval ratings -- she was fine then. She was competent then. We liked her then, as she served as our outstanding Secretary of State. (Applause.)\nAnd for those who question Hillary Clinton's stamina to be President, Hillary's resilience is more than proven. As she discussed during the debate last week, she's the only candidate in this race who has traveled to 112 countries, who has negotiated a ceasefire, a peace agreement, a release of dissidents; who's spent 11 hours testifying before a congressional committee. (Applause.)\nHillary Clinton is tough. When she gets knocked down, she doesn't complain. She doesn't cry foul. (Applause.) No, she gets right back up and she comes back stronger for the people who need her most. And let's not forget that Hillary is one of the few people on this entire planet -- and clearly the only person in this race -- who has any idea what this job actually entails -- (applause) -- the staggering stakes, the brutal hours, the overwhelming stresses. And here's what I say about Hillary: She knows all that, and she's still willing to take this job on. (Applause.) Because here's what I want our young people to understand. Hillary represents everything we teach these kids -- that you use your talents to help as many people as possible -- that's why she's running. (Applause.) See, now for me, that's dedication. That's what love of country actually looks like. So when I hear folks saying that they just don't feel inspired in this election, I have to disagree because right now, we have an opportunity to elect one of the most qualified people who has ever endeavored to become President.\nHillary has been a lawyer, a law professor, First Lady of Arkansas, First Lady of the United States, a U.S. Senator, Secretary of State. (Applause.) And that's why I'm inspired by Hillary. (Applause.) Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? (Applause.) I'm inspired by her persistence. I am inspired by her consistency. How many times, young people, have parents told you, persistence and consistency is the key to everything? I'm inspired by her heart and her guts. And I'm inspired by her lifelong record of public service. (Applause.)\nSo just understand this: No one in our lifetime has ever had as much experience and exposure into the presidency -- not Barack, not Bill, nobody -- and, yes, she happens to be a woman. (Applause.)\nSo, trust me. I've been there. I've seen this job. I've lived with this job. Experience matters. Don't be fooled. Preparation matters. Temperament matters. (Applause.) And Hillary Clinton has it all. She's the real deal, and I have come to know her very well over these years. And I know that she is more than ready, more than able to be an outstanding President for us all. So we cannot afford to squander this opportunity, particularly given the alternative. (Applause.) Because what we do know is that being President is nothing like reality TV -- this is not an apprenticeship. (Applause.) It's about whether someone can handle the awesome responsibility -- do you hear me, the awesome responsibility -- of leading this country.\nSo as you all prepare to make this decision -- and I hope that there are people here who are undecided -- I urge you to ignore the chatter and the noise and ask yourselves: Which candidate really has the experience, the maturity and the temperament to handle this job? Which candidate's words and actions speak to the values we share -- values like inclusion, opportunity, sacrifice for others. (Applause.) Because your answers to these questions on Election Day will absolutely determine who sits in the Oval Office after Barack Obama.\nAnd I want to be clear: Elections are not just about who votes, but who doesn't vote. (Applause.) And that's especially true for our young people, like many of you. So any of you -- for any of you who might be thinking that your vote doesn't really matter, or that one person can't really make a difference, consider this -- and I have shared this every campaign I've been on because it is true for every race, every election. So I want you all, our young people, to think about this every time it's time to vote. Back in 2008, Barack won North Carolina by about 14,000 votes -- (applause) -- that sounds like a lot, right? But when you break that down, the difference between winning and losing this state was a little over two votes per precinct. Yeah. Two or three votes per precinct -- they had gone the other way, stayed home, forgotten about it, got mad, whatever happens. If it had gone the other way, Barack would have lost that state, probably could have lost the entire election. But let's not forget that in 2012, Barack actually lost this state by about 17 votes per precinct -- that was it. Seventeen votes. So whoever your candidate is, understand that your vote matters. Seventeen votes, two votes per precinct. So the fact is that each of you could swing an entire precinct and win this election for Hillary just by getting yourselves, your friends, your family out to vote. But you could also swing an entire precinct for Hillary's opponent with a protest vote or by staying home out of frustration. (Applause.)\nBecause here's the reality: Either Hillary Clinton or her opponent will be President this year. And if you vote for someone other than Hillary or if you don't vote at all, then you'll be helping to elect Hillary's opponent. And in my opinion, the stakes are far too high to take that chance. And remember, it is not about voting for the perfect candidate -- there is no such thing. Presidents are human. In this election, it's about making a choice between two very different candidates with very different visions for our nation. So the question is, do you want Hillary Clinton to be your President or do you want her opponent to be your President?\nAUDIENCE: No!\nMRS. OBAMA: If you choose Hillary, like I do, we've got to get to work -- it's plain and simple. Things are close here. And it's not enough to come to a rally, get a selfie -- I know ya'll love your selfies. (Laughter.) It's not enough to get angry and just speak out about the change we need. We all must take actions to elect folks who will stand with us to make that change. (Applause.)\nSo, you need to get yourself and everyone you know registered to vote today. And we have volunteers here today who can help. I want you to find them and get registered before you leave. And you can also visit IWillVote.com to check your registration status, especially for students. And you can get registered online as well. And then after you do that, we need you to roll up your sleeves and make calls and knock on doors and get folks out. (Applause.) And as you do that, think about those two votes; think about those 17 votes with every call you make, with every door you knock on, with every friend who may already be supporting your candidate -- just getting them out to vote could mean the difference.\nSo, again, you can sign up with campaign volunteers to actually work over this next month to get this done. And as you're working your hearts out for Hillary, as I will be, if you start to feel tired, if you start to feel discouraged by the negativity in this election, if you just want to hide under your bed until it's all over, I really want you all to remember what's at stake. Because the choice we make on November 8th could determine whether you can afford your college tuition. (Applause.) It can determine whether you can keep your health care when you graduate. The election in November will determine whether we close tax loopholes that allow billionaires to keep gaming the system at the expense of working folks. (Applause.) On November 8th, you will decide whether we have a President who believes in science and will combat climate change -- or not. (Applause.) You will decide whether we have a President who will honor our proud history of a nation of immigrants -- or not. (Applause.) You will decide whether we have a President who thinks that women deserve the right to make our own choices about our bodies and our health -- or not. (Applause.) That's what's at stake. That's just the tip of the iceberg.\nSo we can't afford to be tired or turned off. Not now. And I want you all to hear this, because while this might feel like a time of uncertainty and division, when I look out at crowds like this, at our young people, I have never felt more hopeful about the future of this great nation. (Applause.) See, because what I have the opportunity to do as First Lady these past eight years -- it's been an honor to travel from one end of this country to the next. I've met people from every conceivable background and walk of life. And I want you all to understand this, time and again, I have seen proof of what Barack and I have always believed in our hearts -- that we, as Americans, are fundamentally decent, all of us. And we all truly just want the same things. Time and again, Barack and I have met people who disagree with just about everything we've ever said, but who still find it in their hearts to welcome us into their communities with open hearts, willing to listen. And while we might not always change each other's minds, we always walk away reminded that we're not all that different. (Applause.)\nMillions of folks in this country are working long hours to send kids like you to college, just like my mom and dad did for me. (Applause.) There are folks out there who are helping to raise their grandkids, just like Barack's grandparents did for him. (Applause.) There are parents who are working hard to teach their kids the exact same values Barack and I are trying to teach our girls -- that you work hard for what you want in life and you don't take shortcuts -- (applause) -- that you treat people with respect, even if you don't -- they don't look like you or think like you. (Applause.) That when someone is struggling, you don't turn away from them, and you certainly don't take advantage of them. (Applause.)\nWe're trying to teach our kids that we have to imagine walking a mile in one another's shoes, and that we do what we can to help our brothers and sisters, our neighbors. So I want our young people to understand this, even in this election: Don't every let anyone take away your hope. (Applause.) Don't do it. (Applause.) Hope matters. Because that's who we are in this country. This is a country where a girl like me from the South Side of Chicago, whose great, great grandfather was a slave can go to the finest universities on Earth. (Applause.) We live in a country where a biracial kid from Hawaii, who is the son of a single mother, can become President. (Applause.) That is our country -- a country that has always been a beacon for people who have come from shores all over this world, who have poured their hopes and their prayers and their back-breaking hard work into making us who we are today. That is what makes America great -- don't ever let anybody tell you otherwise. (Applause.)\nAnd I am here today because we deserve -- our young people deserve -- a President who can see those truths in us. A President who believes that each of us is part of the American story and that we are always stronger together. (Applause.) A President who can bring out what is best in us -- our kindness, and our decency, our courage and determination -- so that we can keep perfecting our union and passing those blessings of liberty down to our children.\nHillary Clinton will be that President. (Applause.) And what I want you to understand is that I don't have to be here -- I do this because I truly believe that this election matters. I truly want for our young people a President that they can look up to, a foundation that can be lain so that they can be the best that they can be. We have an opportunity to do that, right now, in this election. So my question for you is, are you all with me? (Applause.) Can we get this done? (Applause.) We've got to roll up our sleeves and we have to work every day until Election Day. I know we can do this, you all. I love you so much. (Applause.)\nThank you all. God bless.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122576", "text": "\"Strong rural communities are key to a stronger America\" – President Barack Obama\nTomorrow, Wednesday, October 5, the White House will host the White House Rural Forum, convening rural policy, business, and nonprofit leaders to Penn State University in State College, PA, and announcing new Administration actions in support of rural America. At tomorrow's convening, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, Chair of the  White House Rural Council, and Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf will lead discussions on pertinent issues facing rural communities, including opportunities for economic growth and strategies for improving health care and housing. Secretary Vilsack will also urge lawmakers and the private sector, foundations, and nonprofits to recognize opportunities in America's rural communities to ensure continued social and economic progress.\nSignificant gains have been made across rural America: Rural household income climbed 3.4 percent in 2015, and overall poverty and food insecurity fell dramatically, rural populations have begun to rebound, and non-metro areas have added more than 250,000 jobs since 2014, while the share of rural Americans without health insurance is now at an all-time low.\nEstablished by President Obama in 2011, the White House Rural Council coordinates the Administration's efforts in rural America by streamlining and improving the effectiveness of federal programs, engaging stakeholders on priority issues, and coordinating private sector partnerships to create economic opportunity and improve the quality of life.\nBuilding on the work of the White House Rural Council, today the Administration and non-Federal organizations are announcing new investments and highlighting programs to support continued progress in rural America, including:\n•      $3 Billion Invested in Rural Infrastructure Projects: In 2014,  USDA launched a public-private partnership with Capitol Peak Asset Management and CoBank, a national cooperative bank and member of the Farm Credit System. Since 2014, more than $3 billion in private sector funding has been lent to over 400 financings of projects in the power, water, communications and community facilities industries.\n•      $7.7 Million in New Grants to Bring Broadband to 6 Unserved Communities: USDA's Community Connect program provides funding for broadband deployment into unserved areas. Since 2009, USDA Rural Development broadband programs have helped bring high-speed Internet access to nearly 6 million rural residents and businesses.\n•      $24.4 Million to Fund 80 New Efforts to Support Rural Businesses: Since 2009, USDA has invested $11 billion to start or expand 103,000 rural businesses; helped 1.1 million rural residents buy homes; funded nearly 7,000 community facilities such as schools, public safety and health care facilities; and financed 180,000 miles of electric transmission and distribution lines. New investments announced today:\no      $10.9 million invested in 15 new Rural Economic Development Loan (REDL) and Grant (REDG) projects: Under the REDLoan and REDGrant programs, USDA provides zero interest loans and grants to local utilities which they, in turn, pass through to local businesses (ultimate recipients) for projects that will create and retain employment in rural areas.\no      $9.1 million invested in 15 new Intermediary Relending Program (IRP) projects: Under the IRP program, loans are provided to local organizations (intermediaries) for the establishment of revolving loan funds. These revolving loan funds are used to assist with financing business and economic development activity to create or retain jobs in disadvantaged and remote communities. Intermediaries are encouraged to work in concert with partners who can provide complimentary resources.\no      $1.2 million invested in 4 new Rural Micro-entrepreneur Assistance Program (RMAP) projects: RMAP provides loans and grants to Microenterprise Development Organizations (MDOs) to help micro-entrepreneurs – very small businesses with 10 or fewer employees – access capital to start or grow businesses. MDOs use the funds to provide training and technical assistance to small businesses or to establish revolving loan funds that provide micro-loans, typically $5,000 to $50,000, to rural micro-entrepreneurs.\no      $3.2 million invested in 46 new Rural Business Development Grant (RBDG) projects: RBDG is a competitive grant designed to support targeted technical assistance, training and other activities leading to the development or expansion of small and emerging private businesses in rural areas that have fewer than 50 employees and less than $1 million in gross revenues.\n•      Grants to Increase Rural Veterans' Access to Health Care: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Rural Health is awarding $215 million in grants for FY2017 to 138 VA Medical Centers to prioritize rural programs to increase access to health care services impacting approximately 570,000 rural Veterans and approximately 800 rural providers and health care staff. These grants will support the implementation of proven models of care delivery in rural serving clinics. Programs enhancing Primary Care, Mental Health Care, Specialty Care and Enabling Services will be available in VA clinic locations where these were not previously available.\n•      Investing in volunteer service to address the opioid crisis in Rural America:  The Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) will provide up to 19 AmeriCorps program development grants to states and their governors' service commissions to address the growing opioid crisis in America, including in rural areas of affected States. AmeriCorps VISTA just announced that one of its FY2017 priorities for applications is to have members promote opioid addiction recovery. Last year, CNCS invested $220 million in programs that help rural communities address their biggest challenges. More than 190,000 AmeriCorps and SeniorCorps members served their rural neighbors in every state through tasks like tutoring children, building or repairing homes, and providing nutritious meals.\n•      Rural IMPACT Demonstration pilot program: The Rural Integration Models for Parents and Children to Thrive (Rural IMPACT) Demonstration Project helps communities adopt a two-generation approach to addressing the needs of both vulnerable children and their parents, with the goal of increasing parents' employment and education and improving the health and well-being of their children and families. The project, led by HHS in collaboration with USDA, the Department of Labor (DOL), CNCS, the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Delta Regional Authority, the Annie E. Casey Foundation, W.K. Kellogg Foundation and other philanthropic partners selected 10 local and tribal communities to receive interagency technical assistance and capacity-building resources to reduce child poverty. Today, USDA and CNCS are pleased to announce that AmeriCorps VISTA members will be placed in all 10 Rural IMPACT communities for a second year.\n•      Economic Development Planning Assistance for Rural Communities: Several agencies including the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), USDA, the Departments of Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Health and Human Services, the Economic Development Administration, the Appalachian Regional Commission, and the Delta Regional Authority, is launching Rural Advantage, offering planning assistance to help up to 30 rural communities grow their economies and revitalize downtown neighborhoods. Rural Advantage joins a suite of Federal economic development planning assistance programs for rural communities that include:\no      Local Foods, Local Places, which helps communities leverage local food enterprise to diversify their economy and renew their downtowns;\no      Cool & Connected, which helps communities use broadband service to create walkable, connected, economically successful neighborhoods; and\no      Healthy Places for Healthy People, a new program that will help communities use centrally located health care facilities to promote community development and active living.\nCommunities interested in assistance are invited to apply by November 6th.\n•      Health Information Technology Investments: HHS's Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is investing approximately $36 million in rurally-located health centers to support strategic investments in Health Information Technology. The investments will help health centers enhance their health IT and better prepare providers and staff to use health IT and data.\n•      Investments to Address Chronic Diseases: HRSA is investing $2 million to support rural primary care providers, such as critical access hospitals and rural health clinics, to plan and implement quality improvement activities such as medication management, to address chronic diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity.\n•      Community Coaches to Help Rural Leaders Tackle Child Poverty: The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the University of Wisconsin are providing Community Coaches to ten innovative communities participating in the  Rural Impact County Challenge, an initiative led by the White House Rural Council and the National Association of Counties to address rural child poverty. Coaches will work directly with selected communities' leaders and multi-sector teams to address factors that contribute to child poverty.\n•      Investments in Rural Teacher Preparation Programs: As part of its Teacher Quality Partnership Grants Program, the Department of Education is investing nearly $15 million over five years to develop teacher preparation programs at higher education institutions that partner with high-need schools to help train new and experienced teachers.\n•      Release of \"Rural Strategies that Work\": The White House Rural Council is releasing a memorandum entitled Rural Strategies that Work, which presents strategies for Federal work in rural America that have resulted in improved outcomes over the course of the Obama Administration. Authored by Secretary Vilsack, Office and Management and Budget Director Shaun Donovan, Domestic Policy Director Cecilia Muсoz and National Economic Council Director Jeff Zients, the memorandum presents policies and administrative actions that increase rural communities' ability to access and leverage local and Federal resources.\n•      Highlighting the accomplishments of the White House Rural Council: Secretary Vilsack is publishing a new Medium Post that highlights the work of the White House Rural Council and the organizations with which it works. The post contains stories and videos of Federal-local collaborations to drive economic growth, improve rural quality of life, and expand access to healthcare in rural America.", "timestamp": "2016-10-04", "title": "Fact Sheet: The White House Rural Forum"}

It is great to be here in the city of Henderson, in the beautiful state of Nevada – a state where I have so many great friends and employees.\nIn 34 days, we are going to win this state, we are going to win the White House.\nHow many of you watched the Vice Presidential Debate last night?\nMike did such an incredible job. I would argue that Mike had the single most decisive victory in the history of Vice Presidential debates.\nLast night America also got a firsthand look at my judgement and the judgement of my opponent. Our first Presidential decision was the selection of our running mates, and all of America saw that I made the right choice.\nWhile Mike laid out big and bold solutions for America, his opponent talked only of small and petty distractions.\nHillary Clinton has been there for 30 years, and hasn't fixed anything. In fact, she's just made things worse – she failed upstate New York, promising to create 200,000 jobs, but manufacturing is down almost 40 percent. She failed overseas, producing only death and destruction – she unleashed ISIS, destabilized Iraq, Syria and Libya, and put Iran on the path to nuclear weapons.\nAt home, Hillary Clinton failed Latinos and African-Americans, producing only more poverty in the inner cities.\nShe is merely the vessel for the global special interests bleeding this country dry.\nI am running to represent Americans – and we are going to make America Rich again.\nI am going to end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, keep jobs from pouring out of our country, renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, and massively reduce taxes and regulations on our workers and our small businesses.\nMy economic agenda is very simple: jobs, jobs, jobs.\nThe problems we face as a country are immense, and it is going to take bold action to turn things around.\nRight now, we owe $20 trillion in debt. It doubled under President Obama.\nOur infrastructure is like that of a third-world country.\nThe homicide rate last year experienced the biggest single-year increase in 45 years.\nOur police are under-funded, under-staffed, and under-supported – and Hillary Clinton basically accuses our police of all being racist.\nOur border is wide open, and drugs and criminal cartels are pouring into the country.\nThousands of refugees are being admitted, with no way to screen them, and are instantly made eligible for welfare and free healthcare – even as our own Veterans die waiting for the medical care they need.\nOur annual trade deficit with the world is nearly $800 billion a year.\nThe federal budget is a disaster. Our State Department, mostly under the watch of Hillary Clinton, misplaced or lost $6 billion in taxpayer funds.\nWe have the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.\nWe are a nation divided, with race riots in the streets.\nOur college students graduate, loaded with debt, only to discover they can't find jobs – or certainly not the jobs they want.\nOur allies aren't paying their fair share, foreign countries like Russia and China do not respect us, and our taxpaying citizens send troops and foreign aid all over the world even as their own cities can't provide the most basic services.\nAmerica needs a turnaround.\nAmerica needs a comeback.\nAmerica needs a change.\nThat is why I am running.\nOn November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is back – bigger, and better, and stronger than ever before.\nFirst, we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.\nPresident Obama said if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor.\nThat was a lie.\nHe promised his plan would reduce premiums by $2,500 dollars. Instead, they surged $5,000.\nAnother lie.\nNow, of all people, President Bill Clinton has come out and told the truth about Obamacare.\nTwo days ago, Bill Clinton torched President Obama's signature legislation. Remember, Hillary Clinton called Obamacare \"one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party, and of our country.\"\nBill has a different view. Here is what bill said:\nHe just said it's a \"crazy system,\" and that \"it's the craziest thing in the world.\"\nBill said:\n\"people out there [are] busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, [and] wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half…the people getting killed in this deal are the small business people and the individuals who make just a bit too much money to get any of these subsidies.\" Clinton added that it \"doesn't make any sense,\" and that \"the insurance model doesn't work.\"\nOn my first day in office, I am going to ask a Republican Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare.\nThere is only one way to stop Obamacare: to vote for Trump. The deadline to register to vote by mail is October 8th. The deadline to register to vote online or in-person is October 18th. And early voting begins on the 22nd.\nFixing our trade deals will be the foundation of our economic revival\nChina, Japan, and Europe are printing huge sums of money – the devaluation of currencies is staggering as to what it represents for our country, our businesses, and our citizens.\nWe're not on a level playing field, and our politicians don't understand what is going on.\nOur jobs are being lost in massive numbers, and we are not making things in America anymore. Too much is being made in other countries.\nWhen I am President, we will start making things in America again.\nOur nation has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton's NAFTA – a deal supported by Hillary Clinton. Hillary's Korea deal also cost us another 100,000 jobs.\nSince China entered the World Trade Organization – another Bill and Hillary-backed deal – 70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States.\nThat's 15 factories closing a day, on average.\nWe are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.\nAs the factories leave, our money leaves with them. Stores close, schools suffer, the tax base erodes, wages fall and the quality of life declines.\nReal cash wages for many workers today are lower than they were in 1973.\nWe've rebuilt other countries at the expense of our own. Skyscrapers go up in Beijing, while plants and factories crumble in the United States.\nCompanies like Carrier, General Electric, Motorola, Mattel, Fiat Chrysler, and so many others are moving their jobs to Mexico, and to other countries.\nAnd now, Ford has announced it's moving all of its small car production to Mexico also.\nWe are going to renegotiate NAFTA and if we don't get the deal we want, we will withdraw from NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal for our workers.\nWe are also going to stand up to foreign currency manipulation, and apply tariffs to countries that cheat.\nWe will also stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the deal Hillary called the \"Gold Standard.\" The backers of the deal have donated heavily to Hillary Clinton, and their wish is her command.\nShe is an insider fighting only for herself and for her donors.\nI am an outsider fighting for YOU.\nWe will stop the foreign cheating, the product dumping, and the one-sided trade deals. We will lower taxes on American business, from 35% to 15%, and many small businesses will file as individuals any pay only 12 percent. On top of that, we will have the largest regulatory reform in American history.\nOur tax, trade, energy and regulatory reforms will help us reach 4% growth and create at least 25 million new jobs in a decade.\nAmerica will become the great jobs magnet of the world.\nFactories will come rushing in, our schools and communities will be revitalized, and our poorest citizens will get new jobs and higher pay –and new hope.\nBut to be a rich nation, we must also be a secure nation.\nSecurity begins at the border.\nAny government that does not protect its own people is a government unworthy and unfit to lead.\nCountless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this President Obama and Hillary Clinton.\nThis includes incredible Americans like 21-year-old Sarah Root. The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered federal custody, and then was released into a U.S. community under the immigration policies of Obama-Clinton. He was released again after the crime, and is now at large.\nSarah had graduated from college with a 4.0, top of her class, the day before.\nAlso among the victims of the Obama-Clinton open borders policies was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21 year-old convenience store clerk in Mesa, Arizona. He was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary who had also been released from Federal Custody.\nAnother victim is Kate Steinle, gunned down in the Sanctuary City of San Francisco by an illegal immigrant deported five previous times.\nThen there is the case of 90 year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home. The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records who did not meet the Obama Administration's priorities for removal.\nIn California, a 64-years old Air Force Veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer. Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions, but was never deported.\nAlso in California, my good friend, Jamiel Shaw, lost his amazing son at the age of 17 – he was viciously shot and killed by an illegal immigrant. The killer had 3 gun charges, as well as battery of a police officer, prior to the shooting but he had not been deported from our country.\nThere are more than 2 million criminal aliens with criminal convictions in the country right now, and more who have escaped the law entirely – when I am President, we are getting them out, and we are getting them out quickly.\nAll Americans living lawfully in this country, including millions of patriotic hardworking immigrants, are entitled to have their jobs, their wages, and their security protected. The borders around our nation are for the benefit of all people living here today – and when those borders are erased, it's often the lawful immigrants already here who are the first to suffer lost jobs and decreased security.\nAt the same time, our country is being infiltrated by terrorists. Just two days ago, an immigrant from Bangladesh was charged in another ISIS plot. Hundreds of immigrants from high-risk regions have been implicated in terrorism inside the United States since 9/11.\nThe terrorists who planted the bombs in New York and Jersey, and who carried out the mall stabbing in Minnesota, were foreign nationals admitted into our country – as was the mall shooter in Washington State. Now, the media doesn't want to talk about this – they don't want to ask how our vetting procedures failed, or how immigration from high-risk parts of the world increased the chances of terrorism and violence.\nThe Boston Bombers were here on asylum. The San Bernardino Shooter was here on a fiancй visa from Saudi Arabia. The Orlando shooter was the son of a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan.\nI am going to keep the terrorists out of our country.\nHillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian Refugees.\nHillary is for open borders.\nI am not running to be President of the world. I am running to be President of the United States. I am for America First.\nFor the first time in American history, we have the endorsement of our ICE officers and our Border Patrol officers.\nWe are going to build a border wall, enforce our laws, and keep our people safe. I have a simple message for the cartels, the gang members, and the drug dealers preying on our citizens – your days are numbered, and your reign of crime will soon come crashing to an end.\nWe are also going to end the government corruption\nHillary Clinton put her emails on an illegal secret server open to foreign hacking. Then she bleached and destroyed 33,000 emails – after a congressional subpoena. She lied to Congress, under oath, and her staffers took the Fifth Amendment and got immunity deals.\nNow we have learned that the FBI made a side deal with Clinton's top aides to DESTROY their laptops.\nHillary Clinton is the ringleader of a criminal enterprise and the only way to deliver justice is to mail in your ballots.\nWe are also going to fix our inner cities, and help Latino Americans\n45% of African-American children under the age of 6 live in poverty.\n58% of African-American youth don't have jobs.\nMore than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.\nHomicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.\nThe Democrats, like Hillary Clinton, have run the inner cities for 50 years, sixty years, seventy years or more. They've produced only more joblessness, failing schools, and rising crime.\nTo those African-Americans suffering in our country I say: What do you have to lose? Vote For Donald Trump. I will fix it.\nI am also going to fight to help millions of Latinos trapped in poverty, and to help their children grow up in safety and peace.\nPoor communities will see a massive infusion of new small businesses, and new high-paying jobs. I am also going to fight to provide school choice to every low-income African-American and Latino child in this nation.\nI want to put every American child on the ladder of success: a great education, and a high-paying job.\nHere are some more amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:\nWe are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; end common core; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare affordable; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\nThis Election Day, you have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this country.\nOn November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.\nThe failed and corrupt political establishment will be replaced with a new government of, by and for the people.\nI am going to fight for every last citizen in this land, and I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\nYou're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like you've never seen before. We're going to make history together.\nYou're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote I've ever cast for anyone at any time.\nA vote for me is a vote for change, and a vote for me is really a vote for you. You are voting to believe in yourselves. You are voting to believe in your country.\nAll together, we are going to –\nMake America wealthy again.\nWe are going to make America strong again.\nWe are going to make America safe again.\nAnd we are going to make America great again.", "timestamp": "2016-10-05", "title": "Remarks at Henderson Pavilion in Henderson, Nevada"}

Our State Department, mostly under the watch of Hillary Clinton, misplaced or lost $6 billion in taxpayer funds.\nWe have the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.\nOn top of it all, our taxpaying citizens send troops and foreign aid all over the world even as their own cities can't provide the most basic services.\nAmerica needs a turnaround.\nAmerica needs a comeback.\nAmerica needs a change.\nAnd that change is coming on November 8th. We are going to show the whole world that America is back – bigger, and better, and stronger than ever before.\nFirst, we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.\nPresident Bill Clinton has come out and told the truth about Obamacare.\nTwo days ago, Bill Clinton torched President Obama's signature legislation. Remember, Hillary Clinton called Obamacare \"one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party, and of our country.\"\nBill has a different view. Here is what bill said:\nHe just said it's a \"crazy system,\" and that \"it's the craziest thing in the world.\"\nBill said:\n\"people out there [are] busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, [and] wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half…the people getting killed in this deal are the small business people and the individuals who make just a bit too much money to get any of these subsidies.\" Clinton added that it \"doesn't make any sense,\" and that \"the insurance model doesn't work.\"\nThere is only one way to stop Obamacare: to vote for Trump. The deadline to register to vote by mail is October 8th. The deadline to register to vote online or in-person is October 18th. And early voting begins on the 22nd.\nWith your votes, you will also be voting to protect the 2ndamendment rights of every law-abiding gun-owner in Nevada. Hillary wants to effectively abolish the 2ndamendment, by overturning D.C. vs. Heller and declaring that guns are not a private right. We are also going to conserve your land and natural resources for hunters, anglers, and all who enjoy the outdoors.\nFixing our trade deals will be the foundation of our economic revival\nMy economic agenda can be summed up with three very simple words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\nBut to bring back our jobs, we must fix our trade deals – and stand up to countries that cheat.\nChina, Japan, and Europe are printing huge sums of money – the devaluation of currencies is staggering as to what it represents for our country, our businesses, and our citizens.\nWe're not on a level playing field, and our politicians don't understand what is going on.\nOur jobs are being lost in massive numbers, and we are not making things in America anymore. Too much is being made in other countries.\nWhen I am President, we will start making things in America again.\nOur nation has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton's NAFTA – a deal supported by Hillary Clinton. Hillary's Korea deal also cost us another 100,000 jobs.\nSince China entered the World Trade Organization – another Bill and Hillary-backed deal – 70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States.\nThat's 15 factories closing a day, on average.\nThe jobs are leaving Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Hampshire, Michigan, Illinois, Virginia, and all across this country. I'm going to stop the jobs from leaving our country – and I'm going to bring millions of new jobs back into our country.\nIt's going to be a new day in America.\nFor too long, we've rebuilt other countries at the expense of our own.\nSkyscrapers go up in Beijing, while plants and factories crumble in the United States.\nCompanies like Carrier, General Electric, Motorola, Mattel, Fiat Chrysler, and so many others are moving their jobs to Mexico, and to other countries.\nAnd now, Ford has announced it's moving all of its small car production to Mexico also.\nWe are going to renegotiate NAFTA and if we don't get the deal we want, we will withdraw from NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal for our workers.\nWe will also lower taxes on American business, from 35% to 15%, and we will have the largest regulatory reform in American history.\nThousands of new companies, millions of new jobs, and trillions of dollars in new wealth will come pouring into the United States.\nBut to be a rich nation, we must also be a secure nation.\nSecurity begins at the border.\nHillary Clinton is unfit to be President because she supports open borders.\nIn fact, as Secretary of State, she allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be freed into our country because their own countries wouldn't take them back -- it was her job to cancel visas to countries that refused to take back their criminals.\nBut she didn't do it.\nThe ICE officers, who endorsed me – their first endorsement of a candidate ever – issued a lengthy statement on Hillary Clinton's immigration plans.\nLet me read from it.\nAgain, this all a quote from the ICE officers: \"Hillary Clinton has promised the most radical immigration proposal in U.S. history.\"\n\"Her radical plan would result in the loss of thousands of innocent American lives, mass victimization and death for many attempting to immigrate to the United States, the total gutting of interior enforcement, the handcuffing of ICE officers, and an uncontrollable flood of illegal immigrants across U.S. borders.\"\nTheir quote continues.\n\"She proposes to keep and expand executive amnesty, to expand catch- and-release, to expand President Obama's non-enforcement priorities to the point where there is virtually no real immigration enforcement or policing of visa overstays, to support Sanctuary Cities, to extend Obamacare to illegal immigrants, to grant amnesty within 100 days, to extend Social Security and Medicare to illegal immigrants through amnesty, plus a 550% increase in the admission of Syrian refugees.\"\nThe ICE officers conclude by saying: \"Her plan is total amnesty plus open borders.\"\nThat whole quote is from the nation's Immigration and Customs Enforcement Officers. In short, Hillary's immigration stance is disqualifying.\nThe first duty of the President of the United States is to protect the citizens of the United States – anyone who fails to understand that is unworthy to lead this nation.\nThere are more than 2 million criminal aliens with convictions in the country right now, and many more criminal illegal immigrants who have committed severe offenses but escaped the law entirely – when I am President, we are getting them out, and we are getting them out quickly.\nAt the same time, our country is being infiltrated by terrorists.\nHundreds of immigrants from high-risk regions have been implicated in terrorism inside the United States since 9/11.\nThe terrorists who planted the bombs in New York and New Jersey, and who carried out the mall stabbing in Minnesota, were foreign nationals admitted into our country – as was the mall shooter in Washington State.\nThe Boston Bombers were here on asylum. The San Bernardino Shooter was here on a fiancй visa from Saudi Arabia. The Orlando shooter was the son of a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan.\nYet, Hillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian Refugees.\nI am not running to be President of the world. I am running to be President of the United States. I am for America First.\nWe are going to build a border wall, enforce our laws, and keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.\nWe are also going to end the government corruption\nHillary Clinton put her emails on an illegal secret server open to foreign hacking. Then she bleached and destroyed 33,000 emails – after a congressional subpoena. She lied to Congress, under oath, and her staffers took the Fifth Amendment and got immunity deals.\nIt's worse than Watergate.\nHillary Clinton put her public office up for sale and, if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too.\nNow we have learned that the FBI made a side deal with Clinton's top aides to DESTROY their laptops.\nHillary Clinton is the ringleader of a criminal enterprise and the only way to deliver justice is to show up and vote.\nWe are also going to fix our inner cities, and help Latino Americans\n45% of African-American children under the age of 6 live in poverty.\n58% of African-American youth don't have jobs.\nMore than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.\nThe Democrats, like Hillary Clinton, have run the inner cities for 50 years, sixty years, seventy years or more. They've produced only more joblessness, failing schools, and rising crime.\nTo those African-Americans suffering in our country I say: What do you have to lose? Vote For Donald Trump. I will fix it.\nI will be your greatest champion, and I will deliver real change and justice in your communities.\nI am also going to fight to help millions of Latinos trapped in poverty, and fight to provide school choice to every low-income African-American and Latino child in this nation.\nHere are some more amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:\nWe are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; lift restrictions on all sources of American energy, and put the miners and steelworkers back to work; end Common Core; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; save the 2ndamendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\nThis Election Day, you have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this country.\nOn November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.\nThe failed and corrupt political establishment will be replaced with a new government of, by and for the people.\nI am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation – and I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\nYou're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like you've never seen before. We're going to make history together.\nYou're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote I've ever cast for anyone at any time.\nA vote for me is a vote for change, and a vote for me is really a vote for you. You are voting to believe in yourselves. You are voting to believe in your future. You are voting to believe in your country.\nAll together, we are going to –\nMake America wealthy again.\nWe are going to make America strong again.\nWe are going to make America safe again.\nAnd we are going to make America great again.", "timestamp": "2016-10-05", "title": "Remarks at the Reno-Sparks Convention Center in Reno, Nevada"}

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119558", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:36 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. I apologize for keeping you waiting this afternoon.\nYou all had an opportunity to hear from the President a little bit earlier today who traveled to FEMA and got an update from officials at DHS, including the FEMA Administrator. The President indicated that Hurricane Matthew is a very serious storm and that people should take it seriously. The federal government is certainly undertaking an important effort to prepare for the storm, mobilizing personnel and resources, pre-staging them in strategically valuable locations so that we can mobilize a response in the event that the storm takes the worst possible track.\nWe want people to be mindful of taking this seriously, as well. So there are essentially three things that we're encouraging them to do. The first is to listen carefully to weather reports and to track this storm, particularly if you live in the Southeastern region of the country.\nThe second thing is we want people to go to Ready.gov and understand exactly what preparation they can undertake in advance of the storm to ensure that they and their family are safe.\nAnd then the last thing -- and in some ways this is the most important thing -- we want people to listen very carefully to the advice and instructions that are provided by local officials. Local officials are the ones who know their communities best. They are getting up-to-the-minute information about the track of the storm and the intensity of the storm from scientists at the federal government, and they are making determinations about what steps people must take to ensure their safety and security.\nAnd obviously we want to make sure that we're looking out for all the human lives that are involved. And so we encourage people to listen carefully to the instructions that they receive from local officials in the days ahead.\nSo, with that, Nancy, do you want to get us started?\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Can you give us any sense of the scale of the classified information theft that was announced today at Justice?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Nancy, this is -- there was a complaint that was made public today by my colleagues at the Department of Justice. The existence of that complaint obviously is an indication that there is an ongoing criminal investigation. That's going to limit quite sharply what I'm able to discuss from here.\nFortunately, the complaint that they released does include quite a bit of information about what they've uncovered thus far in the context of their investigation. So for the facts of this case, I'd refer you to that complaint that has been unsealed. But there's not much additional information that I can share from here to shed additional light on that investigation other than to point to the fact that this investigation is still ongoing.\nQ: Is it troubling, though?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think anytime that information like this is released in the context of a criminal complaint, the federal government is reminded of how important it is to be vigilant about protecting the national security of the country and information that is relevant to our national security. So this is certainly a situation that the Department of Justice takes seriously, as evidenced by their complaint. This is also a situation that President Obama takes quite seriously. And it is a good reminder for all of us with security clearances about how important it is for us to protect sensitive national security information.\nQ: Can you give us some sense of thoughts on the French Foreign Minister's efforts to restart U.S-Russia talks on the ceasefire in Syria?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I know that there have been a variety of statements from diplomats around the world who are seeking to address the deeply troubling situation in Aleppo. And I know that there has been an effort at the United Nations that the French have been promoting to express the international community's grave concern about the situation there.\nThe United States, in fact, is participating in diplomatic conversations in Europe through the ISSG -- this is the International Syria Support Group. This is a multilateral organization that's been formed to address the situation in Syria and try to promote international cooperation to confront the situation inside of Syria.\nObviously, there's a U.N.-led effort by Mr. de Mistura, the U.N. envoy. He is trying to facilitate the kind of diplomatic conversations that could reduce violence inside of Syria. And the United States continues to be involved in a range of diplomatic efforts with other countries in the region that have deep concerns about the situation in Syria, and share the U.S. deep concerns -- the United States' deep concerns about the potential national security impacts of the chaos inside of Syria.\nSo there are extensive diplomatic conversations taking place in a variety of settings, and the United States is continuing to expend significant effort in diplomacy to reduce the violence in Syria, to expedite the provision of humanitarian assistance inside of Syria, and to facilitate the kind of political talks that would lead to a political transition inside of Syria.\nQ: So the U.N. today released a pretty compelling satellite imagery from Aleppo showing recent devastation and damage there. Is that the type of thing that the President would be receiving in his briefings? And do you have any thoughts on --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President is certainly being regularly updated about the situation in Syria. And the satellite imagery that was released by the United Nations illustrating the terrible impact of the bombing campaign of the Syrians and the Russians tragically is not particularly surprising. There are a wide variety of anecdotal reports of cluster munitions, bunker busters, bunker buster bombs, and other incendiary explosive devices that are taking an extraordinary toll on the civilian population in Aleppo. The widespread reports of the children that have been killed in Aleppo just in the last few weeks are gut-wrenching, to say nothing of the innocent men and women who have been killed in those military operations.\nOrdinarily, you would be heartbroken to learn that this was the result of some sort of accident. But it's clear that the Syrian regime, backed by the Russians, is engaged in a strategy of bombing those civilians intentionally to try to get them to bend to the will of the Assad regime. They are seeking to drive those innocent civilians out of their homes and out of their communities to accomplish a military and political objective.\nIt's why the United States has supported a range of diplomatic efforts, including at the U.N., to ensure that those who are responsible for these actions are held accountable. So the images are deeply troubling. And the President is regularly updated on this situation, but anybody who reads the newspaper isn't surprised by what those jarring images reveal.\nRoberta.\nQ: Reuters reported yesterday that the U.S. government directed Yahoo! to build a software program to scan arriving emails. And I'm wondering if you could tell us why the government wanted to do this, and whether orders have been -- similar orders have been issued to similar companies looking to scan incoming traffic for certain words or characters, or build custom software to do that.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Roberta, I appreciate the question. As I think you would anticipate, I'm quite limited in what I can say because the report purportedly refers to intelligence programs, and I don't spend a lot of time discussing the intelligence programs here, and I certainly don't confirm the existence of individual intelligence programs or individual intelligence tools.\nBut let me try to respond to your question knowing that I can't discuss the details of the report, or even confirm that the report itself is accurate. But let me just say that we have discussed -- what we have discussed in here many times -- and we discussed this a lot last summer as the United States Congress was working to implement a bunch of reforms championed by the President to ensure that we were protecting our national security and the civil liberties of the American people. But what I can tell you and what we've discussed in the context of that debate is that the intelligence community has specific tools available to collect intelligence information, including the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. And collection under FISA is subject to rigorous oversight by all three branches of government.\nUnder FISA, activity is narrowly focused on specific foreign intelligence targets and does involve bulk collection or the use of generic keywords or phrases. The United States only uses signals intelligence for national security purposes, and not for the purpose of indiscriminately reviewing the emails or phone calls of ordinary people, and certainly not of law-abiding American citizens.\nThe reforms that the President has championed, both using his executive authority and in supporting the USA FREEDOM Act, does bring a measure of greater transparency to these programs, with obvious limits. But those reforms also include beefed-up oversight of the use of these tools. So in the context of FISA, we have previously discussed the existence of FISA courts, essentially federal judges who, in a classified setting, act independently to review requests from intelligence professionals about tools or tactics that they intend to deploy. Those judges obviously have a very important role in this process, and these are federal judges that are able to provide oversight.\nIn addition to that, within the executive branch there are independent inspectors general offices that have jurisdiction over these kinds of programs. These are attorneys who take very seriously the responsibility that they have to ensure that reforms are implemented and that the rules are followed.\nThere has also been an expedited schedule for our intelligence professionals reporting to Congress about their activities. And providing that information to the legislative branch also enhances oversight.\nThe President has also been determined to ensure that we are prioritizing self-reporting -- and again, within the constraints of classified programs. So, for example -- I'll just give you two examples. The first is, there's a Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board that is a bipartisan agency within the executive branch, and earlier this year released its most recent recommendations assessment report. You'll recall that in 2014, they issued a report putting forward 22 suggested reforms. And they have on a regular basis -- I believe it's an annual basis -- been submitting public reports to update the American public on how effectively those reforms have been implemented.\nIn addition to that, the President has also mandated an annual schedule in which the Office of the Director of National Intelligence issues reports about the effectiveness of implementing reforms that balance our civil liberties with our national security needs. And there have been a couple of versions of that report that have come out. And I can tell you that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence will issue another of those annual reports before the President leaves office in January.\nSo there is a mechanism for the public -- again, within the constraints of our ability to discuss classified information -- to evaluate the effectiveness of the reforms that President Obama has championed to ensure that the civil liberties of law-abiding Americans are protected, even as we use powerful tools to protect our homeland security.\nQ: So just to make sure I understand, you're not confirming the use of any of these tools that were reported on. But if any tool was used, it would be subject to that kind of oversight that you described.\nMR. EARNEST: Let me just say that, in general, the tools that are used by the intelligence community to keep us safe are subjected to rigorous oversight by all three branches of government, particularly when these tools are approved in a FISA court.\nQ: And the lead European regulator on privacy issues said today that they're very concerned about this report. And I'm wondering whether U.S. officials have been able to give assurances to their counterparts about whether non-American citizens are caught up in the use of these kinds of tools, and whether any assurances -- whether the government was able to provide any assurances in this case.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the United States has an important information-sharing relationship with intelligence agencies around the world, and a number of those agencies that are based in Europe are some of our closest partners.\nI can't speak to any of the specific conversations that have taken place between U.S. intelligence officials and their foreign intelligence counterparts, but the principles of the reforms that the President initiated over the last couple of years has been rooted in the idea that the United States does not collects signals intelligence for the purpose of suppressing criticism or dissent. The United States does not collect intelligence for the purpose of disadvantaging people based on ethnicity, race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion. The United States does not collect intelligence information to provide a competitive advantage to U.S. companies or U.S. commercial sectors. And in fact, this administration has made clear that we recognize the difference between what we are able to do with our intelligence capability and what the United States should do with our intelligence capability.\nThat is the intellectual bedrock of many of these reforms, particularly as it relates to some of the concerns that have previously been raised by foreign intelligence agencies. And, again, the President is quite proud of the success that we have had in instituting reforms that certainly protect the privacy and civil liberties of the American people, but also do have a positive impact on the privacy and civil liberties of people outside the United States, as well.\nBut the President, at each step in implementing these reforms, has also gone to great lengths to make sure that we're using these tools effectively to protect our national security. And as the President of the United States, he certainly takes very seriously the responsibility that he has to prioritize U.S. national security.\nMichelle.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. The fact that these two thefts of information, both from the NSA -- two in just a couple of years -- involved contractors, does the White House think that that necessitates some greater scrutiny on the process of who these people are, how they come to get into that system?\nMR. EARNEST: And when you say these two cases, you're talking about the case of Mr. Snowden as well, I assume.\nQ: Mm-hmm.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Mr. Snowden is obviously somebody who has been charged with very serious crimes related to classified information and related to his failure to live up to the commitment that he made to protect that information.\nSince 2013, the year that all of us heard of Edward Snowden for the first time, the federal government has taken a number of steps to enhance the protection and security of classified information, including guarding against unauthorized disclosures, especially intentional disclosures. Those steps include building up an effort at the Director of National Intelligence, called the National Insider Threat Task Force. This task force has essentially established government-wide minimum standards for insider threat programs for all agencies that handle classified information. This task force has also launched continuous evaluation programs within the intelligence community to ensure that the high standards that they have set are being adhered to.\nThere are also some more basic changes that have been made with regard to the way background investigations are conducted. For example, there's now a five-year reinvestigation requirement for all individuals with a security clearance. There's also been an effort undertaken to enhance the quality of background investigations. Part of this involves the creation of a National Background Investigations Bureau that will ensure that these background investigations are conducted more efficiently and more effectively.\nCoincidentally or not, it is a coincidence. Just earlier this week, the new director of the National Background Investigations Bureau was announced. And that's an indication that they're moving forward on implementing these kinds of reforms.\nOne other reform that was promoted in the context of the review about what we could do to counter insider threats was reducing the number of people that have access to classified information. And just in the last couple of years, we've succeeded in reducing the number of people that hold classified clearances by 17 percent. So that's an indication of some tangible progress that we have made in ensuring that this information is well protected.\nQ: So seeing two pretty high-profile cases in just three years, what's your confidence level then that there aren't more thefts and leaks out of what is supposed to be the most secure agency really in the country?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, the President has got a lot of confidence that the vast majority of people who serve this country in the national security arena, particularly our professionals in the intelligence community, are genuine American patriots. These are professionals who, in many cases, could pursue a rather lucrative private-sector career based on their specific skills and expertise, but have chosen to use those skills to serve the American people and to protect the United States of America and our allies. These people are patriots. And these are people who take very seriously the responsibility that they have to protect the United States of America and to protect the information that could endanger the United States of America.\nSo that said, we have a responsibility to those professionals and to the American people to be vigilant about ensuring that we are doing everything possible to protect this sensitive information and allow our intelligence professionals to do the important work that they're charged with to protect the American people.\nQ: Okay, and other news. Did the President watch the debate last night? How much did he watch? What did he think of it?\nMR. EARNEST: I didn't have an opportunity to talk to him about it. I know that he was planning to watch the debate.\nWe've talked in here a couple of times now about the warm feelings that the President has for Senator Kaine. Senator Kaine is somebody who in the early days of then-Senator Obama's presidential campaign was among the first, if not the first, statewide elected officials to endorse President Obama's campaign.\nThat was a pretty good sign to the President that he could count on somebody like Tim Kaine to have his back when he needed it. And throughout his campaign, Tim Kaine had the President's back. In the earliest days of the presidency, the President asked then-Governor Kaine to serve as the chairman of the DNC. He served in that role with distinction. And while he served the Commonwealth of Virginia in the United States, President Obama has been able to work effectively with Senator Kaine and has been able to count on Senator Kaine having his back there, too.\nAnd I think Senator Kaine was able to demonstrate publicly that when he makes a commitment to back you up, that that's exactly what he's going to do. And that's a testament to his character, and it's a testament to his leadership. It's a testament to his commitment to a whole set of principles and values that Secretary Clinton shares. It's also a testament to why the President thinks he's such a good friend.\nQ: Did Mike Pence win the debate last night?\nMR. EARNEST: I know there's been lots of analysis that's been done here, and I'll let others weigh in with their personal opinion. I'm obviously more than a little biased.\nQ: Fair enough.\nMR. EARNEST: Chris.\nQ: One thing that didn't come up during the debate last night was Governor Pence's decision to sign into law a measure that was seen to enable anti-LGBT discrimination, a measure that you have criticized from the podium --\nMR. EARNEST: Yes.\nQ: -- that was signed last year. Would a question on Pence taking that action have been useful in highlighting his record?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not going to second-guess the efforts of Elaine Quijano, who was the moderator last night. She came prepared with a long list of very serious, direct questions for each of the candidates. And I suspect based on the sharpness of her questions that that was almost certainly one of the questions that she had in her stack. She probably just didn't get around to it.\nBut look, I'm not going to second-guess the moderators here. They've got a very difficult job. And the most important responsibility that they have is to be fair and ask tough questions. And it seems to me that's exactly what Ms. Quijano did last night.\nQ: Aside from whether or not the question was asked, do you think it's important that voters are reminded of Pence's record on signing this anti-LGBT law as evidence of the way that he would govern if elected to the number-two position at the White House?\nMR. EARNEST: The President certainly feels strongly that voters across the country should carefully consider the agenda, priorities, and record of the president and vice presidential candidates in this race. So that is worthy of scrutiny. And so again, I'm not going to second-guess the moderator in terms of which questions were asked. But it certainly would have been a relevant and fair question to have been asked because his actions as governor should weigh on the decision that voters make, but ultimately it will be up to voters to decide how they factor that criteria into their decision.\nQ: In your opinion, his decision to sign that law was a detrimental action?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what I will say is that I've spoken out publicly with some rather sharp criticism of the law, in part because of the impact that that law has on the people of Indiana.\nThe business climate of the state of Indiana does not benefit from laws that open up potential customers or employees to being discriminated against. And North Carolina has gotten some attention for the negative economic consequences of signing those kinds of bills into law.\nI remember rather vividly when Governor Pence was on Mr. Stephanopoulos's show on one Sunday morning a year or two ago and trying to defend his decision to support this law. And he struggled mightily to do so, in part because it's hard to make a case that that's good for the state.\nBut, again, in terms of what impact this has on people's decision in the presidential election, people are going to have to weigh the factors for themselves. There are obviously a number of things to consider. But it certainly would be legitimate in the mind of the President for somebody to consider that aspect of Governor Pence's record in determining whether or not to support the Republican presidential ticket this fall.\nGo ahead, Lynn.\nQ: Thank you so much. On another topic. Last year, Obama pulled for the Cubs once his White Sox were eliminated. The Cubs now are in the playoffs this year. I'd like to know what you can say about what Obama might be viewing or thinking about the Cubs. And they play in the playoffs Friday and Saturday night, this weekend, when Obama will be in Chicago. Do you know if Obama has any chance of maybe going to Wrigley Field, or watching it from Chicago? Can you just reflect then on the President and the Cubs?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President is a loyal Chicago White Sox fan. And in his mind, when it comes to evaluating baseball teams, that's the team that comes first. But the President is also a champion of his hometown, and he certainly has been pleased to see the Chicago Cubs play so well this year. It's been a long time coming, and Cubs fans have been waiting a long time for a team that looks like this. And there's a reason that they are considered by just about everybody the favorites to win the World Series.\nBut the playoffs in baseball are exciting, and I know the President is looking forward to tracking their progress through the playoffs.\nQ: Do you think there's a chance, though, that he might go to Wrigley? And as you consider that answer, the Ricketts family that owns the Cubs, a wing of it, are conservative Republicans who are helping to bankroll efforts to elect President Trump. Can you comment on that and what you make of that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I know there's at least one member of the family who's a pretty enthusiastic support of President Obama. But I'm confident that the political leanings of the team's ownership would have no impact on the President's decision to attend a game. The President has talked about how much fun he has had in taking in games at Wrigley Field in the past. The vast majority of those were before anybody knew they were sitting next to somebody famous when he attended. But I am not aware currently of any plans that the President has when he travels to Chicago to go to Wrigley Field. But if that changes, we'll obviously let you know.\nMark.\nQ: As long as you're on the issue of Chicago, can you now say whether the President will be casting his vote when he's in Chicago this weekend?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have a more detailed update on the President's schedule. Obviously, he is pretty enthusiastic about publicly demonstrating his support for Secretary Clinton's campaign. We have indicated in the past that part of our conversations with the campaign have involved a discussion about the most effective way to leverage the time that the President can dedicate and support Secretary Clinton. So that means ensuring that his trips often coincide with voter registration deadlines, or the starting of early voting. But I don't have any updated -- a detailed update on his schedule. But we'll be sure to keep you posted.\nQ: I'd also like to ask about a State Department statement today, which used the phrase \"strongly condemn\" the Israeli government about its decision to advance a plan to create a new settlement in the West Bank. I was struck by the phrase \"strongly condemn.\" That's something that the government usually uses to denounce acts of terrorism. We're talking about a friend and a strategic ally. Why isn't that an overly harsh way to describe the U.S. position?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Mark, the recent announcement from the Israeli government does provoke strong feelings in the administration. The fact is, every U.S. administration since 1967 -- Democratic and Republican alike -- has opposed Israeli settlement activity in the Occupied Territories. This administration, on a number of occasions, unfortunately has publicly restated that view. And our concern is based on our longstanding view that settlement activity and other efforts to change the facts on the ground in the West Bank and East Jerusalem undermines the goal of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nExpanding these settlements only makes it harder to negotiate a sustainable and equitable peace agreement in good faith between the two parties. It's also troubling, I would add, that in the wake of Israel and the United States concluding an unprecedented agreement on military assistance designed to further strengthen Israel's security, that Israel would take a decision contrary to its long-term security interest -- a long-term security interest that the United States is prepared to dedicate billions of dollars to protect.\nThe United States has long believed, and we continue to believe, that it's within the clear interest of Israel's national security to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in a way that allows a democratic and Jewish state of Israel to live side by side in peace and security, with a viable and contiguous Palestinian state. And the announcement of these settlements makes that national security priority harder to achieve.\nI think another aspect of this that's troubling is this announcement was made while the world was mourning the death of Shimon Peres. Mr. Peres was a great champion of peace. And the plans that were announced by the Israeli government fundamentally undermine the prospects for the kind of two-state solution that Mr. Peres dedicated his life to passionately supporting.\nSo one other thing about this, Mark, that distinguishes this announcement from so many others is the location. This settlement's planned location is deep in the West Bank. In fact, the settlement location is far closer to Jordan than it is to Israel. And it would effectively link a string of outposts that could divide the West Bank and it would make the possibility of a viable Palestinian state all the more remote.\nSo I think all of those factors -- the location of the settlement, the timing of the announcement, the recent announcement of the U.S. commitment to Israel's security -- all of that combined would explain why the United States is so disappointed and even sharply critical of this decision that's announced by the Israeli government.\nQ: I understand the disappointment, but wouldn't a less vitriolic phrase be more appropriate when dealing with a friend and a strategic ally.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Mark, I think, in some ways, this is one of those situations where actions are more important than words. And if there are people who are wondering about the U.S. commitment to Israel's national security, they have to look no further than the announcement from a few weeks ago that the United States was prepared to make the single largest commitment that we've made in our history to another country's security. That decade-long commitment of, I believe it's $38 billion, I think it's an indication of how strongly the United States feels about protecting Israel's national security and protecting Israel's qualitative military edge in the region.\nIsrael is the United States' closest ally in the Middle East. That's based on our shared values and the longstanding bipartisan commitment to Israel's security that has endured for decades.\nBut -- well, as long as we're talking about actions, the actions of the Israeli government in announcing this settlement undermine the pursuit of peace. And our concerns about that are rooted in the policy that's been championed by Democratic and Republican Presidents alike, which is that the pursuit of peace and the pursuit of a two-state solution is squarely within Israel's national security interests. It also happens to advance the interests of the United States, as well.\nAndrew.\nQ: A follow up on that question. Does the White House consider that Bibi broke his word on this?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we did receive public assurances from the Israeli government that contradict this announcement. And that's -- I guess when we're talking about how good friends treat one another, that that's a source of serious concern, as well.\nQ: And is the timing annoying to you? I mean, you just agreed on the MOU, the President was just in Israel for the funeral.\nMR. EARNEST: And the world was observing the -- the world was mourning the death of Shimon Peres, somebody who had dedicated a significant portion of his career to trying to achieve the kind of two-state solution that would resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This kind of announcement from the Israelis only puts that kind of solution farther from reach. And that is not good for Israel's national security. It's not good for the security interests of the United States. It's inconsistent with the public assurances that have been offered by the Israeli government. And all that's the source of disappointment and deep concern here at the White House.\nRich.\nQ: Josh, at the opening of the briefing, you gave a very detailed list and explanation of safeguards that the administration and federal law has for Americans' privacy. Would the screening of all incoming emails violate those policies?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Rich, let me try to answer that in a couple different ways. Again, I can't -- as much as I would like to discuss publicly the details of this report, I'm just not going to be in a position to. And that means that -- so that's going to limit my ability to answer your question as directly as I would like.\nBut we have been quite clear, since the Obama administration initiated a set of wide-ranging reforms three years ago, that we draw a clear distinction between what capability the United States has and the capability that we should use; that this discretion should be exercised to protect civil liberties, to protect privacy without limiting those tools in a way that contradicts or undermines our national security.\nThe point is, we can do both. And the fact is, we can do both. And I think the observation that the President made is that failing to draw that distinction does undermine our national security. The way that some of those tools were deployed prior to these reforms raised serious concerns around the globe and affected our ability to work with our intelligence agencies. That's not a good thing.\nSo the judicious and effective use of these programs, consistent with the reforms that we've implemented, consistent with independent oversight among three different branches of government is good for protecting privacy and civil liberties of law-abiding American citizens. It also happens to advance our national security interests.\nThat's why the President has not just pursued these reforms but also ensured that we built in mechanisms to report back to the public about how effective the implementation of these reforms has been. So we've made important progress with regard to appropriately striking the balance between protecting civil liberties and protecting the United States of America. But as we develop new tools and as innovations occur that give us new capabilities, it's important for our national security professionals to use these principles to guide their decisions as they appropriately strike this balance.\nAnd, again, the President is pleased with the progress that we've been able to make over the last three years. The truth is, the progress that we've made on this actually dates back even prior to the emergence of Mr. Snowden. This administration had initiated a set of reforms in pursuit of these goals even before the alleged criminal acts of Mr. Snowden were disclosed.\nSo the President is proud of his record on these issues. But the President would also be the first to acknowledge that the successful implementation of these reforms is going to require some vigilance on the part of our national security professionals.\nQ: So he got it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think the public reporting that we've gotten from the Director of -- of the Office of National Intelligence, the public reporting that we've gotten from the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board would indicate that we have been effective in implementing these reforms, in part because the Commander-in-Chief has made them a priority.\nBut again, it's going to require sustained vigilance. And this is a challenge that the next President will have to also prioritize; that again, as the United States develops additional capabilities -- the United States has the best intelligence and national security apparatus in the world. There's a reason that other countries around the world want to partner with the United States, want to find a way to improve their communication with the United States, because they understand how they can benefit from the kinds of capabilities that we have.\nAnd the evolution and improvement of those capabilities is going to require the intelligence community, under the direction of policymakers, to make smart decisions about balancing the need to protect our basic constitutional rights and the need to protect the United States of America.\nQ: How would the administration describe its relationship with the tech community in reference to this?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think I would acknowledge, as I think the tech community would, that there are some places where we don't see eye-to-eye about the most effective way for us to strike this balance.\nI think what is undeniable is that the administration has significantly improved the way that we communicate with technology companies in Silicon Valley. That's important because we know that the innovators and experts in Silicon Valley should be partners of the United States.\nWe know that the engineers and executives at technology companies didn't build these platforms so that terrorists would be more effective. They didn't build these tools so that people who want to harm innocent people can be more violent. In fact, they built these tools because they're committed to the potential impact they could have in making people freer to communicate or express their views, or to associate with people who share their opinions on a range of topics.\nSo there's a lot of common ground to be shared. This administration, this government is certainly committed to protecting those kinds of rights to free speech and expression and association.\nAnd we've also found that the innovation in the tech sphere has also been extraordinarily good for the U.S. economy. We certainly don't want do anything that would inhibit the continued innovation of that technology. We also want to make sure that those innovations aren't used by people who are seeking to do harm to the United States of America.\nAnd so there is an opportunity for the United States government and tech companies here in the United States to effectively coordinate. And we have -- there is one example. Well, there are many examples. But let me just cite one example of where the United States government and technology companies have become more effective at coordinating their efforts.\nWe know that extremists affiliated with ISIL use a wide range of social media tools to propagate their hateful ideology. And there are documented cases where the propagation of that ideology through social media has radicalized people in far-flung corners of the world. And the United States government has worked effectively with Twitter and other social media organizations to shut down the channels that are being used by those extremists. That's a good thing. And that's an indication of the kind of effective coordination between the U.S. government and technology.\nI don't want to leave you with the impression that Twitter or any other social media company agrees on all these issues with the U.S. government. They don't. They probably disagree with us more often than they do agree. But these are complicated issues. And our ability to communicate with them and work through these challenges and identify common ground that will enhance the national security and the privacy of the American people is important. And we have succeeded in doing that in a way that hadn't been done before.\nQ: And finally, on Obamacare very quickly. Do you think that former President Clinton's comments from a couple of days ago will hamper efforts to get people to sign up in this open enrollment season?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't think so, because I think people are making decisions based on a very specific consideration of what's best for their family and what's best for the pocketbook.\nAnd the vast majority of people who go shopping on the marketplaces when the open enrollment period starts in November will find quality, affordable health care options available to them for less than a hundred dollars a month. That's an indication -- that's one piece of evidence that the Affordable Care Act is succeeding in its mission in limiting the growth in health care costs -- certainly when you compare it to the explosive growth we saw in health care costs before the Affordable Care Act went into effect. But it's also undeniably succeeding in expanding access to quality affordable health insurance to more Americans than ever before.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, the Russian government said today it was suspending an agreement with the U.S. on uranium research, and made a similar announcement about plutonium earlier in the week. Given that nuclear security is such a high priority for the administration, is the White House concerned that nuclear security is being used as a bargaining chip here by Vladimir Putin?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think you'd have to discuss with my Russian counterpart the true intentions of Mr. Putin in this particular policy decision.\nWhat I can tell you is that it's certainly within the national interest of the United States of America for us to prioritize nuclear security. And I think any impartial observer would conclude that it's within the national security interests of Russia for nuclear security to be prioritized.\nThere is an opportunity for the United States and Russia to work together in pursuit of those goals. In fact, we have recently. And we're hopeful that we'll be able to continue to do that moving forward, even in the midst of some vigorous disagreements on other issues.\nQ: And you see this as related to those other issues?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I will leave it to President Putin to explain exactly what his motive is and whether or not he believes that is somehow connected to other disagreements that he has with the United States. He's obviously making a range of unilateral decisions, so I'll let him explain them.\nWhat I will say is that the United States believes that these are important priorities, and we're hopeful that agreements that were reached by the Russian government -- or between the United States and Russian government that were rooted in each side's national interest will continue to be pursued, not just because of the explicit obligation that they have to pursue those agreements, but because of the clear national interest that they have in seeing those agreements thrive.\nQ: Did you happen to notice that your face ended up on the Russian Embassy's Twitter feed, next to a weapons system, earlier today?\nMR. EARNEST: I only saw it because you helpfully retweeted it. (Laughter.) So thank you for that.\nQ: I thought it was notable.\nMR. EARNEST: I see.\nQ: Did you have a comment on why they would be posting you next to the line, \"Every defensive measure necessary will be taken to protect our personnel stationed in Syria from a terrorist threat\"?\nMR. EARNEST: I have no idea what message they were trying to send. If they'd like better pictures, though, I'm happy to send some. (Laughter.)\nQ: Hopefully without an S-300. (Laughter.)\nOn a more serious note, though, I do want to ask you -- the Syrian regime has announced that people should flee Aleppo, and they have offered safe passage, so to speak, to those who seek to do that. Does the White House believe it's just too late to intervene to save those people in Aleppo?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what's clear is that the Assad regime continues to pursue a strategy of bombing civilians into submission. It's grotesque. It's disgusting. And there are many observers who have declared that it is a violation of international law.\nThe situation in Aleppo is one that is a source of deep concern. And the willingness of the Russians to aid and abet the Syrians in carrying out this murderous campaign against innocent civilians raises a lot of questions about their credibility. It certainly has isolated them in the international community. And it's something that we're deeply concerned about.\nQ: Does that concern translate into considering action this week, or some decisions to take action in Aleppo? Or have you ruled that out?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the administration has, as I mentioned earlier, been working through diplomatic channels at the U.N., through the ISSG, through our other bilateral relationship with countries in the region to discuss the ongoing situation in Syria more broadly, but also in Aleppo as well. So there are a range of diplomatic discussions that have taken place. And those kinds of discussions will continue.\nI'm not going to stand here and take options off the table for the Commander-in-Chief, but as we discussed yesterday, there are significant consequences for using U.S. military force against the Assad regime. I would say the most important of those consequences that we should be mindful of is dragging the United States into another ground war in the Middle East.\nSo this is a situation that has been carefully considered by the President and his national security team, including his military advisors. And the President will listen carefully to that advice as he makes decisions moving forward.\nQ: John McCain had an op-ed today blasting the Syria policy of the administration as having \"failed miserably.\" He said, \"The administration still has no strategy to do anything about it. Its diplomacy is toothless, and there appears to be no plan B.\" Is there a plan B?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the most notable thing about Senator McCain's op-ed is that at least he was partially honest about his differences with the Obama administration. Senator McCain advocated in that op-ed for going to war with Syria, for increasing our military commitment and for sending U.S. military forces to Syria.\nThat's not the advice that the Commander-in-Chief is receiving from our military leadership at the Department of Defense. So to do so goes against the advice the President has received from intelligence community and from the uniform military leadership at the Pentagon.\nIt also would have grave consequences for our national security. It would be expensive. It would put at risk more American lives. And it's unclear how a conflict like that would end. This is a lesson that leaders in both parties should have learned after the ill-advised invasion of Iraq in 2003.\nQ: You're talking about a ground conflict. I think some of this had to do with using airpower. At last night's debate, both candidates from both parties, including Tim Kaine, differed from the current Obama administration strategy and suggested using more airpower to have some sort of protected zone. Are you also saying, in that detailed explanation you just gave, that even using military force in another form has been taken off the table or rejected? Does it have all those same risks you just laid out?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what is clear -- there's a letter that we'll send to you. This is a letter that was prepared by then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Dempsey, in response to questions from the United States Senate about what sort of military options were available to the President. In that letter, General Dempsey outlined the military commitment that would be required to establish a no-fly zone or a safe zone inside of Syria.\nHe pointed out the significant cost that that safe zone would cost in excess of a billion dollars a month. He noted that it would require the deployment of thousands of U.S. military personnel on the ground to secure that area. He noted that it would require significant air assets because it would have to include enforcing a no-fly zone above the area. He noted that it could present to extremists or even to the Assad regime a large target because there was a concentrated area of refugees. We know that the Assad regime and extremists have both targeted innocent people in their murderous campaign over the last few years.\nWe also know that many of those attacks don't come from the air, they come from the ground. We also know that extremists could potentially use that safe zone to organize attacks in that area. There's the danger of extremists infiltrating through refugee populations inside that safe zone.\nSo the United States wouldn't just be on the hook for protecting the air above that safe zone; the United States wouldn't just be on the hook for protecting the perimeter of that safe zone; the United States would be on the hook for policing the interior of that safe zone. It would require a substantial commitment of military assets. It would require a substantial financial commitment.\nAnd there might be some who would say, well, General Dempsey wrote that letter before the United States committed substantial military personnel to going after ISIL. And I think the answer that I have in response is pretty direct. Are you suggesting that we could divert our attention from ISIL and al Qaeda to start another war with the Assad regime in Syria? That doesn't seem like it makes a lot of sense. It certainly would go against the advice that General Dempsey has put forward. I haven't spoken to General Dunford about it directly, but I am confident, based on his public statements that he agrees with the assessment that General Dempsey put forward.\nBut it does go back to a fundamental difference between the approach that's been pursued by the Obama administration and the approach that's pursued -- or advocated, at least by Senator McCain, which is the President doesn't believe that it's in our national interest to start another ground war in the Middle East.\nSo the President has demonstrated a willingness -- effective willingness -- to use military action to go after ISIL, to pressure their leadership, to support forces on the ground that are retaking territory that ISIL previously held. But the President has done that in smart way to protect our national security without entangling us into the kind of ground war in the Middle East that would have long-term consequences for our national security. And they aren't -- most of them are not positive.\nQ: But the other half of the Syria policy is that the vacuum and war that involves Assad will only continue to feed the carnage and the terrorism, and the growth of extremists from there. So that's the other half of the equation, right?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes.\nQ: So what are your going to do to address that? And not to divert attention, but to complete the policy that you've laid out.\nMR. EARNEST: And what we have been very clear about, Margaret -- and, again, this is the difference between the approach that's advocated by Senator McCain. The administration does not believe that there is a military solution to that problem. It's going to require tough, principled diplomacy, and that's exactly what we've been engaged in.\nAnd again, Senator McCain did lay this out in his op-ed, and that's why I'm willing to give him partial credit for what he included in there. He did note that the political failures of the Assad regime are the root cause, and those political failures must be addressed. But the President does not believe that those political failures should be addressed by commencing a ground invasion by the United States military. The President believes that we're going to have to work through diplomacy and we're going to have to find ways to work with our allies, and partners, and occasionally with even countries like Russia to figure out how we can reduce the violence, reduce the suffering, and initiate the kind of political talks that everybody acknowledges are necessary to bring about a transition in Syria that will address the root cause of this problem.\nAnd I don't want to say that's even harder than it sounds -- because it sounds pretty complicated when I describe it -- but it's even more complicated than that. And again, this is something that Secretary Kerry has been tireless and dogged in his pursuit of, but we have not succeeded in reducing that violence in a sustained way. We have not succeeded in ensuring the sustained flow of humanitarian assistance there. So we're continuing to work very diligently through the U.N., through other international bodies like the ISSG, but also through the use of our bilateral relationships to try to address the situation.\nKaren.\nQ: Yesterday, the Vice President call Governor Pence \"qualified.\" We've heard the President on many occasions talk about how Donald Trump is not qualified to be President. What are the President's thoughts on Pence? Does he share the Vice President's view?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't heard the -- I haven't talked to the President about Governor Pence. Obviously, I think it was evident from the debate that there are a number of vigorous differences that we have with him on a wide range of policies, both foreign and domestic. But I haven't asked the President the direct question that you just posed.\nQ: And later today, the First Lady is going to announce an expansion and preservation effort of the garden. Can you talk a little bit more about that? And also, has there been outreach from the White House from the East Wing to the transition teams about what would happen after January 20th?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any discussions with the transition teams. Presumably, this would be the kind of discussion that would take place after the voters have had their say.\nBut you've heard the First Lady talk on a number of occasions that the White House Garden is a personal passion of hers. And she had sought to use the White House Garden as an educational tool to talk to the public but also to kids about the benefits associated with eating healthy and how much fun it can be to be engaged in growing food, and eating healthy, and spending time outside. These are all personal passions of hers, and it's something that I think has really sparked the imagination of people all across the country. And I'm confident that in future houses she'll have an opportunity to talk about gardening and her passion for this topic.\nYes, sir.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I wanted to ask you about Colombia. The State Department confirmed today that Bernie Aronson was going to go back to Havana for this next round of talks. I just wanted to get -- what are the White House expectations for his role? Also, there's $390 million in the budget for Peace Colombia. I wanted to know what is that money going to be spent on now? As Marco Rubio has said, since the Colombian citizens voted against the plan, the U.S. shouldn't be spending the tax money on that plan that was rejected by Colombians.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as it relates to the activities of the special envoy, I'd refer you to the State Department who can give you a specific update. I will say, in general, that his approach will be similar to the approach that he took in offering support to the negotiations that led to this agreement, and that is that he'll continue to encourage all sides to maintain a commitment to the ceasefire. And fortunately, we have seen a public expressions of that commitment by all parties. And we certainly -- Special Envoy Aronson will certainly be committed to trying to -- using the influence of the United States to facilitate the kind of agreement that can win the support of the Colombian people.\nWhat exactly that process looks like is one that will be determined by President Santos, but you can certainly expect that Special Envoy Aronson and other U.S. officials will be supportive of that ongoing effort to complete negotiations around a peace agreement and build public support for it.\nWith regard to Peace Colombia, the United States is going to continue to remain engaged in the ongoing efforts of the Colombian people to end the longest-running civil conflict in the hemisphere. And the United States, for more than a decade now, has been supportive of the Colombian government and the Colombian people as they've undertaken this effort. And this is -- the Peace Colombia effort is just the next stage of the support that we can offer.\nAnd so now seems like a pretty bad time to withdraw our support and abandon the Colombian government and the Colombian people, particularly when you consider that all sides remain committed to peace. All sides have abided by the ceasefire. All sides have demonstrated a commitment to trying to figure out how to negotiate the kind of peace that will have the strong support of the Colombian people. So that's what they're working on, and this administration is determined to support the Colombian people in pursuit of peace.\nQ: Can you explain what the $390 million will be spent on under this new scenario that the Colombian citizens didn't support?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any significant changes that will be made to this peace proposal based on the outcome of the plebiscite. This is -- the United States government continues to be strongly supportive of the Colombian government and the Colombian people. That includes not just through our vocal support of the peace process, but also providing them the kinds of resources that will strengthen their democracy, strengthen their economy, and enhance the security of communities all across the country.\nQ: Can you address Marco Rubio's comments more directly, that the U.S. should not be spending taxpayer money on a plan that the Colombians didn't support?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, given the commitment by all parties to pursuing peace, now seems like a bad time to walk away from the Colombian people. And that's not something that the President is going to do.\nJane.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. On North Korea. For the implementation of U.S. individual sanctions against North Korea, recently the U.S. Treasury Department announced ongoing financial sanctions against the North Korea. Do you have any detail on this?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't, but I encourage you to check with my colleagues at the Treasury Department who may be able to provide you some more specifics.\nQ: Is there any additional sanctions, except the Chinese oil company? Do you have any update?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't. And the reason is simply that we refrain from discussing publicly any plans we have to put in place additional sanctions. And the reason for that is a common-sense one: We don't want to telegraph our intentions because we don't want to give the potential targets of those sanctions the opportunity to take actions that would evade the sanctions.\nSo we're not going to be in a position to talk publicly about what plans we may have in the future, but for more detailed understanding of what kind of sanctions have already been implemented, I'd encourage you to check with the experts at the Treasury Department and they can work with that -- work through that with you.\nQ: A THAAD missile deploy in South Korea. Do you have any particular date for the THAAD deploying in Korea?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of a deadline that has been set for the implementation or the installation of the THAAD battery. The United States will work in close coordination with our allies in South Korea to determine the most effective location and date for the installation of that system that will significantly enhance the safety and security of our allies in South Korea.\nQ: How did you convince China? Because Chinese is opposing THAAD.\nMR. EARNEST: I think they'd probably tell you they're not convinced. But the argument that we have made that is rooted in fact is that the system is oriented to the threat that South Korea faces from North Korea. And it should in no way inhibit or destabilize the situation with regard to China's capabilities.\nAnd this is a -- there's been a more technical explanation that's been provided at a variety of levels by U.S. officials to their Chinese counterparts. Chinese officials remain unconvinced. But South Korea has a legitimate threat that they need to counter, and they're turning to the United States, one of their closest friends and allies in the world, to offer up additional resources that can be used to protect their country. And while the threat from North Korea is so urgent, it makes sense that South Korea would look for a way to further enhance their security. And the United States is glad that we can be there to support our ally in a time of need and that we can provide this sophisticated system to enhance their national security.\nQ: And when they continue (inaudible)?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, no. We will maintain an open dialogue with the Chinese, and that will include regular offers of technical explanations about why this is something that they should not be unduly concerned about.\nJohn Bennett, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Maybe we can go back to the baseball theme for a moment.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm happy to do that. (Laughter.)\nQ: Apologies in advance for the metaphor. But the President is entering the campaign kind of in the ninth inning, seems kind of in a closing role. Does he view it as -- does he view the race as it stands right now as a save opportunity, or does he think Secretary Clinton has a larger lead?\nMR. EARNEST: That's a creative way to ask that question. Well, let me -- I'm trying to think of a way to respond to your question in the appropriate spirit.\nLet me just say that I think the President views himself as a clean-up hitter. He's got the biggest bat in the line-up. He's the guy with the high approval rating. He's the guy with the enormous influence among young people and African Americans and Hispanics and women who are likely to play an important role in determining the outcome of this race. And the President has had a couple of opportunities to step to the plate, but he'll have many more in the five weeks that remain until Election Day to make a case while the whole stadium is watching.\nAnd he's looking forward to that opportunity, and he feels like he's got a strong case to make in support of somebody that he has seen up-close be an effective, powerful advocate for middle class families and for the interests of the United States of America all around the globe.\nQ: So he feels like he's got to go up swinging, like we saw last night in the late stages of --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think -- again, I think when the game is this important, you're not just going to walk up there and leave the bat on your shoulder. The President is definitely going to go up there swinging, and that would be true regardless of the score. And again, the President is looking forward to the opportunity.\nThanks. See you guys. We'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 2:49 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2016-10-05", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}

I'm probably as emotional as everybody sitting in this garden to be here with you today as we officially dedicate our White House Kitchen Garden.\nPeople look at my daughters, and they see how time has flown by. And then I look at Tammy. And I remember Tammy to the day because she -- her face is the same, but you did absolutely grow. (Laughter.) And you've matured is what you've done. You have grown into such a poised, gracious young lady. And I know your mother is proud. It's just been a complete honor to have you by my side on this project. So, Tammy, thank you. (Applause.)\nOh, my goodness. I also want to say a few huge thank yous to a few more people -- to the folks from the Burpee Foundation and the W. Atlee Burpee Company for their generous support of the National Park Foundation to preserve this garden for the future. And I want to recognize the Whole Kids Foundation for making this day possible. And what a beautiful day it is. This has been the garden's luck, right? It rained all week and we were on pins and needles that we'd have to do this inside. And this is a perfect day -- a perfect day.\nAnd of course, I want to thank all the students and the faculty at the University of Virginia School of Architecture who did such an incredible job in designing the magnificent new arbor, as well as the gathering area, the table, the benches that we're unveiling here today. This is my first time seeing it. I was in the garden last week, and everything was being dug up. I've only seen pictures. But this, you all, is amazing. It is really amazing -- the representation, the work, the fact that you guys are homegrown students in this area, it really just warms my heart. You should be incredibly proud of the work you've done.\nAnd thanks to Roger Sherry for his craftsmanship in building all of this. He's done a phenomenal job, and I just got to meet him today. It's amazing. It's amazing what you've done. It's beautiful. It's beyond anything I could have imagined. So thank you, Roger. (Applause.)\nAnd, of course, to the National Park Service, the crew, the team for helping bring this vision to life from the very beginning. You guys -- we almost cried. This has been a labor of absolute love. And you all have been down here with us every single day thinking about different ways to reinforce the beds, thinking about all the extras, coming down here when there have been wind storms and snow storms and hail storms, and making sure that things go well. It's just been a true blessing to have you all. This garden wouldn't exist if it weren't for your efforts. So thank you all. (Applause.)\nAnd I'm going to go a little bit off-script for some who have been following this program. There is a team that's behind all this Let's Move! stuff. I come out, and I give a speech, or I dance with Ellen, or I do something else silly. (Laughter.) But behind Let's Move! is a team. And most recently, it's been run by our executive director, Deb Eschmeyer. (Applause.) And I want to thank Deb. Stand up, Deb. (Applause.)\nAll right, the words on the script say I want to thank her for her passion, dedication, expertise and vision, but Deb is off-the-charts enthusiastic. (Laughter.) I mean a Deb briefing is like, oh, my God, this is great. It's going to be wonderful. (Laughter.) I don't know what to say. (Laughter.) Deb is enthusiastic, but she's also experienced. She is not light on substance at all. She knows this stuff. And it's just been a pleasure to work with you.\nI know it's been an adjustment coming to the White House, but you've done it seamlessly. And you've kept this initiative going in ways I could have only dreamed. So, Deb, thank you. I'm so proud of you. Well done. (Applause.)\nAnd then there was my original partner in crime, old man Sam Kass. (Laughter.) Who is now a grownup, wearing a suit. I don't even recognize you. Sam, as all of you know, has been the driving force, the hammer, the carrot, the stick. He probably harassed many of you to the point of I don't know what -- probably lost his temper a few times. I know he and Tina used to get into a lot. It would be fun to watch them argue. Sam coined the term \"unprecedented!\" Because everything Let's Move! did was \"unprecedented!\" (Laughter.) To the point where we were like, okay, everything is not unprecedented. It became our code word. It was the word that we used to think of Sam. But Sam because of your unprecedented leadership, we are here today. And it's been a nice ride from the kitchen on Greenwood where we talked about this vision to now. So don't cry. Not yet. But here it is, and a lot of this is because of you. So thank you, babe. (Applause.)\nAnd then there are a whole host of staff members who have come and gone, who have -- we've stolen people. We've left them. And to all the staff members who have helped make Let's Move! a reality, I am just grateful to you all. You've done tremendous work.\nBut most of all, I want to thank all the leaders who are here, all of you who are here, all the leaders, the partners who've been with us from the very start. Through every struggle and success, you all are the reason we're here today. And I am beyond grateful for everything you all have done to get us to this point.\nAnd I have to tell you that being here with all of you, overlooking this beautiful garden -- and it is beautiful -- it's kind of an emotional moment. We're having a lot of these emotional moments because everything is the last. But this is particularly my baby because this garden is where it all started. So we're really coming full circle back to the very beginning.\nAs you all know, this idea of the garden was actually born, as I said, months before Barack even came into office, in our family's kitchen before we even set foot here. It was back then when Barack was first running, and we were -- Sam and I sitting at the table, Chicago one night trying to wrap my head around what we'd actually do if my husband managed to win. There were the questions of what kind of First Lady I would be, what issues would I focus on. Those were the questions that were being pounded on me through the campaign. A lot of times I wondered what in the world Barack was even getting us into.\nAnd then after taking a few deep breaths, we started thinking about the challenges that many families faced, so many other families were facing the same things that we were, trying to raise healthy kids. And many of us didn't understand the impact that the food we ate was having on our bodies, on our kids' bodies, or how we felt. Like we just didn't have the right information, or we didn't have the time that we needed to buy and prepare healthy food for our families.\nSo I had this crazy idea that what if we planted a garden on the White House lawn to start a conversation about where our food comes from and how it impacts our children's health. Well, fast-forward to spring of 2009 -- Barack actually won; he won twice. (Applause.) And we finally got settled in. Girls were in school. We knew which doors went to which rooms, and that's when we decided to move forward on this idea of planting a garden.\nNow, at first there were folks who didn't think this was such a great idea. There were those that wondered: Well, why is Michelle Obama tearing up the White House lawn?\nAnd then there were plenty of folks who thought that the issue of childhood obesity was actually too \"soft\" -- some said it was too \"First Ladyish.\" I guess for somebody like me.\nOthers had the opposite reaction. They thought this problem was much too large, much too complicated for a First Lady, maybe like me. (Laughter.) They worried that this was big government telling people what to feed their kids.\nAnd frankly, to be honest with you, I had plenty of doubts of my own. What if we planted this garden and nothing grew? We talked about that. How did we? We didn't know about the soil, or the sunlight. And it's like, oh, my God, what if nothing grows? What if we got just a few sad little tomatoes and a bunch of weeds after a big press announcement? It was like afterwards I remember telling Sam, this better work, buddy. (Laughter.) This better work.\nWhat if we poured all this time and hard work into trying to move the needle on our kids' health, and in the end, we had nothing to show for it? We invested -- we put all our chips on this bet.\nWell, fortunately, these worries never came to pass because right from the beginning, it was people like you -- all of you here, who stepped up to make our work successful.\nFolks from the National Park Service cared for this garden with such skill, and with such heart day in and day out, making sure that it didn't fail. We had kids like Tammie from Bancroft and Tubman schools -- because there are many, many kids who came here season after season, planting and harvesting. Schools across the country came in, and they blew us away with their enthusiasm, and their work each year, planting and harvesting. It was just amazing to watch them, and then to watch them grow up through the garden.\nThen we have our White House staffers, people who volunteered in droves to help maintain this along with the Park Service. This garden for many became a refuge from the stresses of their job. You imagine dealing with God knows what in the West Wing, and then being able to come here and just pick some weeds. (Laughter.) Very meditative.\nWe created the first-ever White House beehive and hopefully our bees are asleep right now. We talked about that. Because the bees can be problematic. We love our bees. But that's been so much fun. We give the honey away to everybody. Christmas gifts, leaders' gifts, spousal gifts. Everybody has got honey. We've got plenty of it.\nWe have the first-ever White House compost system to highlight the importance of having healthy soil. That's back there. It's going -- it's blazing, our composting. We plated the first-ever pollinator garden to provide a home for our birds and butterflies and our bees.\nThe food we've grown here has nourished thousands of our neighbors at a local organization serving those in need. And our chefs. And Bill is back. Our chefs rely on it. It's been -- they've used the garden -- it's featured in our White House State Dinners. So it's been just phenomenal. It's been a phenomenal resource for our team.\nIn fact, my husband will tell you that one of the most frequent questions he gets from world leaders is: \"How's your wife's garden?\" Yes, it's true.\nAnd over the years, this little garden has inspired countless folks across this country to plant gardens of their own. The number of schools with gardens here in D.C. alone has increased by 50 percent since 2011. (Applause.)\nThere is now an aeroponic garden at O'Hare Airport in my hometown of Chicago. I got to go see that. And a hospital near Philadelphia even planted an organic farm right on their campus to provide food for their patients, and they employ two farmers to take care of it. The president of that hospital said, \"If the White House can do it, we can do it, too.\"\nSo this garden has helped us start a national conversation about how we live and eat, a conversation that led to the first-ever White House Task Force on Childhood Obesity.\nAnd as you all know, this task force reviewed every single program and policy in the entire federal government relating to children's nutrition and physical activity. And they laid out a roadmap with five core areas of focus, including early childhood, empowering parents, providing more nutritious school meals, bringing healthier food into our communities, and increasing physical activity.\nAnd we use these goals as our North Star for everything that we did, from passing the Child Nutrition bill, to slow dancing with Big Bird on an episode of \"Billy on the Street,\" from improving the nutrition fact labels on 800,000 food products, to enlisting industry leaders through the Partnership for a Healthier America. Yes, indeed, the Partnership. (Applause.) To our incredible Kids State Dinner, which is the highlight around these parts, to holding a push-up contest with Ellen – which, by the way, Ellen, I won. (Laughter.) I don't know what you're talking about. She brought that up the other day. She thinks she won. I won.\nAnd today, six and a half years later, when we step back and think about the impact we've made through Let's Move!, well, the numbers speak for themselves. And I'm just going to take a moment to just cite some of them.\nToday, 81 million Americans -- that's about one in four people in this country -- woke up in a Let's Move! City, Town and County. (Applause.) Fifty million kids had access to healthier meals and snacks at school; 11 million kids attended a Let's Move! Active School where they can get 60 minutes of physical activity a day; 1.6 million kids attended a Let's Move! Child Care program, where they're eating 225 million healthy meals and snacks a year; 8.1 million people in underserved areas had somewhere to buy healthier food, including 1,000 convenience stores.\nAnd these numbers don't even begin to capture the kind of transformational culture change that we've seen since we launched Let's Move!\nI mean, after an era of everything being super-sized, who would have thought that major companies would be racing to market smaller, lower-calorie versions of their snacks and beverages – from half-sized candy bars to little, mini soda cans. We see it everywhere we go.\nWho would have predicted that a marketing campaign for fruits and vegetables would get 1 billion media impressions and feature product endorsements from athletes like Steph Curry?\nWho would have thought that chain restaurants focused solely on salad would be the hottest new trend, or that those fitness bracelets would be so common that we wouldn't even notice them any longer, or that Kwik Trip would sell an average of 400 pounds of bananas per store per day, or that we'd take it for granted that we can get apples and skim milk in kids' meals at fast food places. Today we just assume that we can find healthy options at the drive-thru. So it's not surprising that childhood obesity rates in this country have stopped rising, and they've even started falling for our youngest kids.\nThat's the kind of change we've seen in just six and a half years. And make no mistake about it, all of this didn't happen because of me. It happened because of all of you. That's why we thought it was so important to invite you to this celebration. You all are the ones.\nIt happened because elected officials like Mayor Pete Buttigieg -- see I got that right, Mayor Pete -- Mayor Pete, who is here with us. You talked to him earlier. He made this his cause, starting community gardens, building sidewalks and parks, starting summer nutrition programs and youth athletic leagues.\nIt happened because Food Service Directors like Donna Martin, who worked day and night to come up with healthy recipes that would make kids love their lunches -- baking chicken instead of frying it, making pizza with whole wheat crust -- homemade whole wheat crust, by the way, loading it with vegetables. And I have to tell you, we visited some of those schools. Those kids were cleaning their plates. We were cleaning our plates. It was the only school I've ever gone to where the staff was trying to get Styrofoam takeout to eat lunch on the plane. That has never happened before. (Laughter.) So the kids at these schools don't even know the difference.\nAnd our success happened because of athletes like Alonzo Mourning, my dear friend, who use their star power to inspire kids to get active, and because industry leaders like Cathy Burns who got creative about marketing healthy food to kids, because visionary folks like Risa Lavizzo-Mourey, who made game-changing investments and stuck with this issue year after year after year. And that's really key. The kind of investment that's been made over decades. Not just, this was nice, now we're moving on. But sticking with this for the long haul.\nSo let's be clear, no one can ever look at Let's Move! and say that this was just Michelle Obama's initiative. This has truly become a movement. And it certainly won't end when I leave the White House because we still have a long way to go before we solve this problem.\nAs I said back when we first launched Let's Move!, this is a generational challenge. But this garden has taught us that if we have the courage to plant a seed, just be brave enough to plant it, then take care of it, water it, tend to it, invite friends to help us take care of it, weather the storms that inevitably come, if we have the courage to do that, we never know what might grow. Now that's what this garden has taught me, to be fearless in those efforts, to try some new things, to not be afraid to mess up. Things we tell our kids all the time.\nAnd while this is the last time I'll be able to bring you all here to the White House as First Lady, we're not here today to say good-bye. Because I didn't just take on this issue on as First Lady, I took it on because I'm a mother who cares deeply about the health and well-being of my daughters. I took it on because I'm a citizen who loves this country and cares deeply about the future of all of our kids.\nSo I intend to keep working on this issue for the rest of my life. (Applause.)\nAnd I'm very excited about what lies ahead because there is no better time to be engaged in this issue than now. We have new science and technologies that will drive innovations in ways that we can't even imagine. We have momentum like we have never seen, or could have dreamed of.\nAnd healthy eating is starting to become the new norm for our kids. For many of them, you just think of it -- kids like Tammy and younger, this is all they'll ever know.\nSo let's be very clear, this isn't just a trend. It's not a passing fad. This healthy eating stuff, it's here to stay, and we now have everything we need to seize the opportunity and give all our kids the healthy futures they so richly deserve.\nAnd I take great pride in knowing that this little garden will live on as a symbol of the hopes that we all hold of growing a healthier nation for our children -- aspirations that have their rightful place here, in this beautiful spot outside of our nation's home.\nI take pride in knowing that this garden will serve as a reminder of what we all started, but also what we all have left to do. And as we dedicate this garden here today, I am hopeful that future First Families will cherish this garden like we have, and that it will become one of our enduring White House traditions.\nSo I want to end like I began, I want to say thank you. This has been fun. That's the beauty of it. It's been a lot of work. It's been hard work. But it's felt so easy because of people like you, who have been open and thoughtful and creative and courageous and knew how to have a laugh every now and then. So it has been a true absolute privilege. And I hope everyone feels like we can drop the mic on this one. (Laughter and applause.)\nSo you all thank you all, I look forward to working with you in the years ahead. Enjoy.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122565", "text": "Since the beginning of his Administration, President Obama has deepened the commitment of the United States Government to draw upon the talents and skills of all parts of our society. Diversity has always been one of the Nation's greatest strengths, and it is no different for the Federal workforce, which has a responsibility as the country's largest employer to lead by example and to reflect the population that we serve. Inclusion has been key to ensuring that the investments we make to develop our workforce result in a more effective and skilled government for the American people.\nThe imperative to promote diversity and inclusion is also critical for our national security workforce. In a complex and interconnected world, the nature of our national security challenges and opportunities is more global than ever. As a society that can trace its roots to every region around the world, the American people are our greatest asset when it comes to the United States' ability to build bridges to communities at home and abroad, address foreign threats and aggression, and lead coalitions to promote global peace and prosperity. Promoting diversity and inclusion ensures that national security departments and agencies can recruit their employees from the broadest possible pool of talent and bring a wide range of perspectives, skills, and backgrounds to bear to tackle our toughest problems.\nToday, the President is issuing a new Presidential Memorandum that provides guidance on the implementation of policies to promote diversity and inclusion in the national security workforce. Currently, more than three million military and civilian personnel in the U.S. Government are engaged in protecting the country and advancing our interests abroad, through diplomacy, development, defense, intelligence, law enforcement, and homeland security. In broad comparison with the wider Federal Government, the federal workforce dedicated to our national security and foreign policy is – on average – less diverse, including at the highest levels.\nWhile this data does not necessarily indicate the existence of barriers to equal employment opportunity, the Presidential Memorandum outlines a number of actions that will allow departments and agencies to better leverage the diversity and inclusion of the federal workforce, consistent with the existing merit system and applicable law, including:\n•      Collection, analysis, and dissemination of workforce data: Data is an essential tool to help departments and agencies identify workforce talent gaps, assess the efficiency and effectiveness of their diversity and inclusion efforts, and promote transparency and accountability. The memorandum provides guidance for departments and agencies to make key workforce data available to the general public, provide an annual report to their leadership and workforce on the status of diversity and inclusion efforts, expand the use of applicant flow data to assess the fairness and inclusiveness of their recruitment efforts, and identify any additional demographic categories they recommend for voluntary data collection.\n•      Provision of professional development opportunities and tools consistent with merit system principles: Providing access to professional development opportunities consistent with merit system principles is a key element to retaining and developing a diverse and inclusive workforce. The memorandum directs departments and agencies to engage their workforce through regular interviews to understand their views on workplace policies and why they choose to stay or leave, prioritize the expansion of professional development opportunities including programs specifically designed to develop the next generation of career senior executives, and implement a review process for decisions related to certain assignment or geographic restrictions.\n•      Strengthening of leadership engagement and accountability: The memorandum recognizes the critical role that senior leadership and supervisors play in fostering a diverse and inclusive workforce and cultivating talent consistent with merit system principles. It encourages departments and agencies to reward and recognize efforts by senior leaders and supervisors to participate in mentorship, sponsorship, and recruitment; to disseminate voluntary demographic data for external committee and boards that advise the leadership of an agency; and to expand the provision of training on implicit or unconscious bias, inclusion, and flexible work policies.\nThe guidance in this Presidential Memorandum furthers the initiative that President Obama announced in 2011 in Executive Order 13583, \"Establishing a Coordinated Government-wide Initiative to Promote Diversity and Inclusion in the Federal Workforce,\" for departments and agencies to develop and implement a more comprehensive, integrated, and strategic focus on diversity and inclusion. It also complements the remarkable progress that the national security workforce has made over the past several years in recognizing the importance of diversity and inclusion to the success of their mission, including but not limited to:\n•      The Department of Defense's decisions to eliminate all remaining institutional barriers to service by opening all military occupations to women and  transgender individuals;\n•      The Central Intelligence Agency's commissioning and public release of two studies on  women and  diversity in their leadership and its active implementation of the studies' recommendations;\n•      The Office of the Director of National Intelligence release of its annual Intelligence Community demographics report, the first time it has ever been  publicly released; and\n•      The Department of Justice  announced that all law enforcement agents and prosecutors will receive training to recognize and address implicit bias.\nThe Presidential Memorandum also aligns with a number of congressional efforts to promote the diversity of the national security workforce. Over the past several decades, Congress has passed legislation mandating reforms to ensure that institutions including the Foreign Service, Intelligence Community, and U.S. military provide equal employment opportunity to all those who have the desire and qualifications to serve their country. Under this Administration, the Congress and President Obama have collaborated on important legislation on this issue, most notably on the  Don't Ask Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010.", "timestamp": "2016-10-05", "title": "Fact Sheet: Presidential Memorandum on Promoting Diversity and Inclusion in the National Security Workforce"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "The President spoke at 11:42 a.m. in the M-1 Conference Room.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119074", "text": "Well, Administrator Fugate here at FEMA, as well as a number of other agencies, our Army Corps of Engineers, our National Guard, have just briefed me on preparations that we're making for the possibility of some serious effects from Hurricane Matthews.\nMatthew could have—soon affect areas all across the Southeast. So, at my direction, FEMA has been on the ground in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina, working with State and local officials to prepare for the storm. We've already got response teams and supplies prepositioned and ready to help communities in the region.\nI want to emphasize to the public: This is a serious storm. It has already hit Haiti with devastating effect. It is now in the process of moving through the Bahamas. Because it's not going to be hitting enough land, it is going to be building strength on its way to Florida. We anticipate that by tomorrow morning it will already begin to have significant effect in Florida and then has the potential to strengthen and move on up the coast during the course of the day.\nSo I want to make sure that everybody is paying attention to your local officials. If there is an evacuation order in your community, you need to take it seriously. We anticipate that not only is there still a chance that the core of the storm strikes Florida and some of the States further north, but even if you don't get the full force of the hurricane, we are still going to be seeing tropical-force winds, the potential for storm surge, and all of that could have a devastating effect.\nSo everybody needs to be paying attention and following the instructions of your local officials. And if you get an evacuation order, just remember that you can always rebuild, you can always repair property, you cannot restore a life if it is lost. And we want to make sure that we minimize any possible loss of life or risk to people in these areas.\nI also want to make sure that we say thanks to the folks at the National Weather Service and the FEMA team for the outstanding work that they're doing here. Craig, just in case folks aren't aware, comes from Florida, is intimately familiar with the dangers of hurricanes, and it just so happens that he's got family in areas that could be affected by this storm. So this is personal for him. You know that he's going to be working around the clock to make sure that we are preventing any potential loss of life and trying to minimize as much as possible the impacts of this storm. But this is going to be a serious storm, and we want everybody to take it seriously as well.\nEven as we prepare for the hurricane here at home, I want us to keep in mind that Haiti, one of the poorest countries in the world, already suffering from a range of previous disasters, has been hit really hard by this storm, and we anticipate that they are going to need substantial help. There may be similar needs in places like the Bahamas. So I would ask that people who are willing to contribute and willing to help to visit the Center for International Disaster Information. The website is CIDI.org—CIDI.org. You can find out how you can help make life a little bit easier for people who didn't have a lot to begin with and now are really getting hammered by this storm. And last point for everybody in the potentially affected States: Even as you are waiting to get instructions from your local officials, now is the time for you to prepare in the event that you have to evacuate. Even if you don't have to evacuate—there is not an evacuation order—it still makes sense for you to figure out what kind of plan do you have, what kind of preparations and supplies do you have. And if you need help trying to figure that out, go to ready.gov—ready.gov—because that will give you some really clear instructions about how to make sure that you are securing your property and keeping your family safe, which is obviously the priority for all of us.\nSo this is something to take seriously. We hope for the best, but we want to prepare for the worst. And I would urge everybody in the affected States of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina to pay very close attention to your local officials and the broadcasts that are going to be coming through over the next several hours. All right?\nThank you very much, everybody.", "timestamp": "2016-10-05", "title": "Remarks Following a Briefing on Hurricane Matthew Preparedness Efforts at the Federal Emergency Management Agency"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "The President spoke at 3:30 p.m. in the Rose Garden at the White House.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119075", "text": "Good afternoon, everybody. Today is a historic day in the fight to protect our planet for future generations.\nTen months ago, in Paris, I said before the world that we needed a strong global agreement to reduce carbon pollution and to set the world on a low-carbon course. The result was the Paris Agreement. Last month, the United States and China, the world's two largest economies and largest emitters, formally joined that agreement together. And today the world has officially crossed the threshold for the Paris Agreement to take effect.\nToday the world meets the moment. And if we follow through on the commitments that this Paris Agreement embodies, history may well judge it as a turning point for our planet.\nOf course, it took a long time to reach this day. One of the reasons I ran for this office was to make America a leader in this mission. And over the past 8 years, we've done just that. In 2009, we salvaged a chaotic climate summit in Copenhagen, establishing the principle that all nations have a role to play in combating climate change. And at home, we led by example, with historic investments in growing industries like wind and solar that created a steady stream of new jobs. We set the first-ever nationwide standards to limit the amount of carbon pollution that power plants can dump into the air our children breathe. From the cars and trucks we drive to the homes and businesses in which we live and work, we've changed, fundamentally, the way we consume energy.\nNow, keep in mind, the skeptics said these actions would kill jobs. And instead, we saw, even as we were bringing down these carbon levels, the longest streak of job creation in American history. We drove economic output to new highs. And we drove our carbon pollution to its lowest levels in two decades.\nWe continued to lead by example with our historic joint announcement with China two years ago, where we put forward even more ambitious climate targets. And that achievement encouraged dozens of other countries to set more ambitious climate targets of their own. And that, in turn, paved the way for our success in Paris: the idea that no nation, not even one as powerful as ours, can solve this challenge alone. All of us have to solve it together.\nNow, the Paris Agreement alone will not solve the climate crisis. Even if we meet every target embodied in the agreement, we'll only get to part of where we need to go. But make no mistake: This agreement will help delay or avoid some of the worst consequences of climate change. It will help other nations ratchet down their dangerous carbon emissions over time, and set bolder targets as technology advances, all under a strong system of transparency that allows each nation to evaluate the progress of all other nations. And by sending a signal that this is going to be our future—a clean energy future—it opens up the floodgates for businesses and scientists and engineers to unleash high-tech, low-carbon investment and innovation at a scale that we've never seen before. So this gives us the best possible shot to save the one planet we've got.\nI know diplomacy can be [isn't always; White House correction.] easy and progress on the world stage can sometimes be slow. But together, with steady, persistent effort, with strong, principled American leadership, with optimism and faith and hope, we're proving that it is possible.\nAnd I want to embarrass my Senior Adviser, Brian Deese, who is standing right over there, because he worked tirelessly to make this deal possible. He and John Kerry, Gina McCarthy at the EPA, everybody on their teams have done an extraordinary job to get us to this point, and America should be as proud of them as I am of them.\nAnd I also want to thank the people of every nation that has moved quickly to bring the Paris Agreement into force. I encourage folks who have not yet submitted their documentation to enter into this agreement, to do so as soon as possible. And in the coming days, let's help finish additional agreements to limit aviation emissions, to phase down dangerous use of hydrofluorocarbons, all of which will help build a world that is safer and more prosperous and more secure and more free than the one that was left for us.\nThat's our most important mission: to make sure our kids and our grandkids have at least as beautiful a planet and, hopefully, even more beautiful, than the one that we had. And today I'm a little more confident that we can get the job done.\nSo thank you very much, everybody.", "timestamp": "2016-10-05", "title": "Remarks on the Paris Agreement on Climate Change"}

These immigrants and their descendants have changed the course of our history and paved our country's path of progress, and on German-American Day, we recognize their role in building a stronger and more prosperous Nation for all our people.\nFrom those who were among our earliest settlers and farmers to today's innovative leaders in business and public service, German Americans have shaped every sector of our society. More Americans can trace their roots to Germany than to any other nation, and elements of German heritage are embedded deeply in our country's character. German Americans have, throughout our history, proven that our diversity is one of our greatest strengths, and that no matter where we come from, as Americans we are united by the ideal that we are all created equal.\nToday, the alliance between the United States and Germany is one of the closest the world has ever known. Our cooperation in striving to protect the security and sustainability of our planet is guided by the enduring friendship between our citizens and the experiences and values that bind us together. On this occasion, let us honor the achievements of German Americans by renewing our devotion to beliefs borne out of common experience—by creating opportunity that lifts up not just the few but the many, and by affirming the inherent dignity and equality of every human being.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 6, 2016, as German-American Day. I encourage all Americans to learn more about the history of German Americans and reflect on the many contributions they have made to our Nation.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-10-05", "title": "Proclamation 9515—German-American Day, 2016"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "This memorandum was published in the  Federal Register  on October 7.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119077", "text": "Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies\nSubject: Promoting Diversity and Inclusion in the National Security Workforce\nOur greatest asset in protecting the homeland and advancing our interests abroad is the talent and diversity of our national security workforce. Under my Administration, we have made important progress toward harnessing the extraordinary range of backgrounds, cultures, perspectives, skills, and experiences of the U.S. population toward keeping our country safe and strong. As the United States becomes more diverse and the challenges we face more complex, we must continue to invest in policies to recruit, retain, and develop the best and brightest from all segments of our population. Research has shown that diverse groups are more effective at problem solving than homogeneous groups, and policies that promote diversity and inclusion will enhance our ability to draw from the broadest possible pool of talent, solve our toughest challenges, maximize employee engagement and innovation, and lead by example by setting a high standard for providing access to opportunity to all segments of our society.\nThe purpose of this memorandum is to provide guidance to the national security workforce in order to strengthen the talent and diversity of their respective organizations. That workforce, which comprises more than 3 million people, includes the following departments, agencies, offices, and other entities (agencies) that are primarily engaged in diplomacy, development, defense, intelligence, law enforcement, and homeland security: 1) Department of State: Civil Service and Foreign Service; 2) United States Agency for International Development (USAID): Civil Service and Foreign Service; 3) Department of Defense (DOD): commissioned officers, enlisted personnel, and civilian personnel; 4) the 17 members of the Intelligence Community; 5) Department of the Treasury: Office of International Affairs and Office of Critical Infrastructure Protection; 6) Department of Justice: National Security Division and Federal Bureau of Investigation; and 7) Department of Homeland Security.\nThe data collected by these agencies do not capture the full range of diversity in the national security workforce, but where data allow for broad comparison, they indicate that agencies in this workforce are less diverse on average than the rest of the Federal Government. For example, as of 2015, only the Department of State and USAID Civil Services were more diverse in terms of gender, race, and ethnicity than the Federal workforce as a whole. When comparing the agencies' workforces to their leadership personnel (Senior Executive Service (SES) or its equivalent), all agencies' leadership staffs were less diverse than their respective workforces in terms of gender, and all but DOD enlisted personnel and USAID Civil Service had less diverse leadership in terms of race and ethnicity. While these data do not necessarily indicate the existence of barriers to equal employment opportunity, we can do more to promote diversity in the national security workforce, consistent with merit system principles and applicable law.\nWhen I issued Executive Order 13583 of August 18, 2011 (Establishing a Coordinated Government-wide Initiative to Promote Diversity and Inclusion in the Federal Workforce), I directed all departments and agencies to develop and implement a more comprehensive, integrated, and strategic focus on diversity and inclusion. This memorandum supports that effort by providing guidance that 1) emphasizes a data-driven approach in order to increase transparency and accountability at all levels; 2) takes into account leading practices, research, and experience from the private and public sectors; and 3) complements ongoing actions that agencies are taking pursuant to Executive Order 13583 and under the leadership of the Diversity and Inclusion in Government Council, including but not limited to efforts related to gender, race, ethnicity, disability status, veterans, sexual orientation and gender identity, and other demographic categories. This memorandum also supports Executive Order 13714 of December 15, 2015 (Strengthening the Senior Executive Service), by directing agencies to take additional steps to expand the pipeline of diverse talent into senior positions.\nThis memorandum also aligns with congressional efforts to promote the diversity of the national security workforce, which have been reflected in legislation such as the:\n• Foreign Service Act of 1980, which urged the Department of State to develop policies to encourage the \"entry into and advancement in the Foreign Service by persons from all segments of American society\"; • Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, which called on the Intelligence Community to prescribe personnel policies and programs that ensure its personnel \"are sufficiently diverse for purposes of the collection and analysis of intelligence through the recruitment and training of women, minorities, and individuals with diverse ethnic, cultural, and linguistic backgrounds\"; and • National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, which mandated that the U.S. military develop and implement a plan to accurately measure the efforts of the military to \"achieve a dynamic, sustainable level of members of the armed forces (including reserve components) that, among both commissioned officers and senior enlisted personnel of each armed force, will reflect the diverse population of the United States eligible to serve in the armed forces, including gender specific, racial, and ethnic populations.\"\nPromoting diversity and inclusion within the national security workforce must be a joint effort and requires engagement by senior leadership, managers, and the entire workforce, as well as effective collaboration among those responsible for human resources, equal employment opportunity, and diversity and inclusion issues. In implementing the guidance in this memorandum, agencies shall ensure their diversity and inclusion practices are fully integrated into broader succession planning efforts and supported by sufficient resource allocations and effective programs that invest in personnel development and engagement. Where appropriate, they shall also support, coordinate, and encourage research and other efforts by the Federal Government to expand the knowledge base of best practices for broadening participation and understanding the impact of diversity and inclusion on national security, including in the fields of science and technology.\nTherefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct the following:\nSection 1. Collection, Analysis, and Dissemination of Workforce Data. Although collected data do not necessarily indicate the existence of barriers to equal employment opportunity, the collection and analysis of metrics allows agencies to assess their workforce talent gaps, as well as the effectiveness of their diversity and inclusion efforts and the adequacy of their resources to address these gaps. The dissemination of data to the public and to agency personnel may increase the transparency and accountability of their efforts. Accordingly, agencies in the national security workforce shall:\n(a) Make aggregate demographic data and other information available to the public and broader workforce. Agencies shall make available to the general public information on the state of diversity and inclusion in their workforces. That information, which shall be updated at least once a year, shall include aggregate demographic data by workforce or service and grade or rank; attrition and promotion demographic data; validated inclusion metrics such as the New Inclusion Quotient (New IQ) index score; demographic comparisons to the relevant civilian labor force; and unclassified reports and barrier analyses related to diversity and inclusion. Agencies may publish data in proportions or percentages to account for classification concerns, and the Intelligence Community may publish a community-wide report with the data outlined in this section. In addition, agencies shall provide to their workforces, including senior leadership at the Secretary or Director level, a report that includes demographic data and information on the status of diversity and inclusion efforts no later than 90 days after the date of this memorandum and on an annual basis thereafter (or in line with existing annual reporting requirements related to these issues, if any).\n(b) Expand the collection and analysis of voluntary applicant flow data. Applicant flow data tracks the selection rate variances for job positions among different demographic categories and can assist agencies in examining the fairness and inclusiveness of their recruitment efforts. Agencies shall develop a system to collect and analyze applicant flow data for as many positions as practicable in order to identify future areas for improvement in attracting diverse talent, with particular attention to senior and management positions. The collection of data may be implemented in a phased approach commensurate with agency resources. Agencies shall include such analysis, including the percentage and level of positions for which data are collected, and any resulting policy changes or recommendations in the report required by section 1(a) of this memorandum.\n(c) Identify additional categories for voluntary data collection of current employees. The Federal Government provides minimum reporting categories for agencies collecting race and ethnicity information in the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) Statistical Policy Directive \"Standards for Maintaining, Collecting, and Presenting Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity.\" That standard also encourages agencies to collect more detailed data, which can be compared by aggregating such data into minimum categories when necessary. Further, agencies may also collect additional demographic data, such as information regarding sexual orientation or gender identity. No later than 90 days after the date of this memorandum, agencies shall determine whether they recommend the voluntary collection of more detailed demographic data on additional categories. This process shall involve close consultation with internal stakeholders, such as employee resource or affinity groups; clear communication with the workforce to explain the purpose of, legal protections related to, and anticipated use of such data; and adherence to relevant standards and guidance issued by the Federal Government. Any determinations shall be submitted to OMB, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and the Department of Labor for consideration.\nSec. 2. Provision of Professional Development Opportunities and Tools Consistent with Merit System Principles. An inclusive work environment enhances agencies' ability to retain and sustain a strong workforce by allowing all employees to perform at their full potential and maximize their talent. Professional development opportunities and tools are key to fostering that potential, and each agency should make it a priority to ensure that all employees have access to them consistent with merit system principles. Agencies in the national security workforce shall therefore:\n(a) Conduct stay and exit interviews or surveys. Agencies shall conduct periodic interviews with a representative cross-section of personnel to understand their reasons for staying with their organization, as well as to receive feedback on workplace policies, professional development opportunities, and other issues affecting their decision to remain. They shall also provide an opportunity for exit interviews or surveys of all departing personnel to understand better their reasons for leaving. Agencies shall include analysis from the interviews and surveys—including if and how the results of the interviews differ by gender, race and national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability status, and other demographic variables—and any resulting policy changes or recommendations in the report required by section 1(a) of this memorandum.\n(b) Expand provision of professional development and career advancement opportunities. Agencies shall prioritize resources to expand professional development opportunities that support mission needs, such as academic programs, private-public exchanges, and detail assignments to relevant positions in private or international organizations; State, local, and tribal governments; or other branches of the Federal Government. In addition, agencies in the national security workforce shall offer, or sponsor employees to participate in, an SES Candidate Development Program (CDP) or other programs that train employees to gain the skills required for senior-level agency appointments. In determining which employees are granted professional development or career advancement opportunities, agencies shall ensure their SES CDP comports with the provisions of 5 C.F.R. part 412, subpart C, including merit staffing and assessment requirements. Agencies shall also consider the number of expected senior-level vacancies as a factor in determining the number of candidates to select for such programs. Agencies shall track the demographics of program participants as well as the rate of placement into senior-level positions for participants in such programs, evaluate such data on an annual basis to look for ways to improve outreach and recruitment for these programs consistent with merit system principles, and include such data in the report required by section 1(a) of this memorandum.\n(c) Institute a review process for security and counterintelligence determinations that result in assignment restrictions. For agencies in the national security workforce that place assignment restrictions on personnel or otherwise prohibit certain geographic assignments due to a security determination, these agencies shall ensure a review process exists consistent with the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, as well as applicable counterintelligence considerations. Agencies shall ensure that affected personnel are informed of the right to seek review and the process for doing so.\nSec. 3. Strengthening of Leadership Engagement and Accountability. Senior leadership and supervisors play an important role in fostering diversity and inclusion in the workforce they lead and in setting an example for cultivating talent consistent with merit system principles. Toward that end, agencies in the national security workforce shall:\n(a) Reward and recognize efforts to promote diversity and inclusion. Agencies are strongly encouraged to consider implementing performance and advancement requirements that reward and recognize senior leaders' and supervisors' efforts in fostering an inclusive environment and cultivating talent consistent with merit system principles, such as through participation in mentoring programs or sponsorship initiatives, recruitment events, and other opportunities. They are also encouraged to create opportunities for senior leadership and supervisors to participate in outreach events and to discuss issues related to diversity and inclusion with the workforce on a regular basis, including with employee resource groups.\n(b) Collect and disseminate voluntary demographic data of external advisory committees and boards. For agencies in the national security workforce that have external advisory committees or boards to which their senior leadership appoints members, they are strongly encouraged to collect voluntary demographic data from the members of committee and boards, and to include such data in the information and report required by section 1(a) of this memorandum.\n(c) Expand training on unconscious bias, inclusion, and flexible work policies. Agencies shall expand their provision of training on implicit or unconscious bias, inclusion, and flexible work policies and make implicit or unconscious bias training mandatory for senior leadership and management positions, as well as for those responsible for outreach, recruitment, hiring, career development, promotion, and security clearance adjudication. The provision of training may be implemented in a phased approach commensurate with agency resources. Agencies shall also make available training for bureaus, directorates, or divisions whose inclusion scores, such as those measured by the New IQ index, consistently rank below the agency-wide average 3 or more years in a row. Agencies should give special attention to ensuring the continuous incorporation of research-based best practices, including those to address the intersectionality between certain demographics and job positions.\nSec. 4. Reporting on Progress. No later than 120 days after the date of this memorandum, and on an annual basis thereafter, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, in consultation with the Directors of OMB and OPM, shall report to the President on the progress of the national security workforce in implementing the requirements of this memorandum, based on information provided by relevant departments and agencies.\nSec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof, or the status of that department or agency within the Federal Government; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of OMB relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law, and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n(d) The Director of OPM is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-10-05", "title": "Memorandum on Promoting Diversity and Inclusion in the National Security Workforce"}

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119557", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n10:54 A.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good morning, everybody. Nice to see you all. A couple quick things before we get started. Just a logistical announcement -- I know that the call time for the President's event with the Pittsburgh Penguins is in about 45 or 50 minutes here, so if you need to excuse yourself to participate in that event I will not be personally offended.\nSecond, the President was updated once again on the preparations underway to prepare for the likely landfall of Hurricane Matthew. The weather forecasters at the National Hurricane Center and at NOAA now anticipate that the impact of the storm in the United States is likely to be quite significant. We strongly encourage people who live in the areas that are likely to be affected to heed the warnings and instructions of local officials, including evacuation orders.\nThe instructions that are being offered by local officials are informed by information that they are receiving from scientists and from federal officials, and those instructions are geared toward protecting people. And we believe that it's important for people to listen to those instructions. We also encourage people to stay up to date on the weather forecast. Those of you who have been covering this story know that the weather forecast for the forecast track of the storm has changed multiple times just this week, so it's certainly is not outside the realm of possibility that it could change once again. We want to encourage people to stay up to date on that. But what we did learn overnight is that it's likely that this storm could strengthen further before making landfall, and that obviously is deeply concerning. So we want people to be prepared.\nThe last thing I'd say about this is that there are those who doubt the intensity or severity of the storm, they need only look at the images that are coming back from Haiti, where it's clear the storm had a rather significant impact in Haiti. And that is pretty good evidence of what people in the Southeast could be facing.\nFor those Americans that are interested in offering up their assistance to Haiti, we encourage people to visit CIDI.org. It's a place where you can get some more information about how you can help a country like Haiti that doesn't have the resources that we do to deal with such a significant storm.\nBut obviously this is a pivotal day. People need to be making preparations and following orders today. The storm is likely to begin being felt this evening. And certainly over the course of the day, those of us who don't live in potentially affected areas will be sending our prayers to those who are potentially in harm's way. But people should take confidence from knowing that federal officials have been working very effectively with officials at the state and local level to prepare in advance of this storm. We've developed an expertise and we intend to use our resources and that expertise to protect the American people. And that will be put to the test in the next few days.\nSo, with that, Darlene, do you want to get us started?\nQ: Yes. A couple of follow-up questions on the latest theft of classified information. Does the administration have a better sense of exactly what information was taken or stolen?\nMR. EARNEST: This is an investigation that is being led at the FBI. Federal prosecutors obviously released documents yesterday that indicated that this individual had been in custody for several weeks. The Department of Justice also made clear in the documents that were released yesterday that the investigation was ongoing. So as there is more information that our investigators are comfortable discussing publicly they'll make the decision to do so.\nAnd obviously protecting sensitive national security information is a top priority of the administration, and it certainly is an issue that this administration takes seriously. It's also an issue that prosecutors and investigators at the Department of Justice take seriously. So that investigation is continuing, and as additional information can be made public about it, it will come from the Department of Justice.\nQ: People everywhere are probably wondering how this could happen again after Edward Snowden and reforms that were supposed to have been put in place after the Snowden theft. Can you address at all how something like this has happened again in post-Snowden era?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Darlene, I'm going to hesitate to draw too many connections between these two cases. Each case is unique. Some of the similarities in the case have been well-documented publicly. But let me start by answering your question about the reforms that have been put in place.\nThe administration has put in place reforms principally through the National Insider Threat Task Force that is being led by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. We have established government-wide minimum reforms for these kinds of insider threat programs that prevent the theft or unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information.\nThe intelligence community has launched a series of continuous evaluation programs to help determine whether an individual with a security clearance needs it and should continue to hold it. That effort has been effective in actually reducing the overall number of people that hold security clearances -- that number has fallen about 17 percent just in the last several years.\nThere also has been a requirement instituted that individuals who hold a security clearance need to submit to a reinvestigation every five years to ensure that they are complying with the terms that they have committed to. What we've also tried to do is to enhance the quality of background checking investigations, background investigations. And there is a new agency that has been stood up to ensure that those investigations are more thorough and more efficiently conducted.\nSo this is certainly something that the administration takes seriously, and there are important lessons that we have learned since the case of Mr. Snowden. But, Darlene, I think that this risk is always going to be there as long as there is a desire to share sensitive information across the government. And we know that there is a risk of not sharing that information. You'll recall that this is one of the principal insights of the 9/11 Commission, that there is too much stove-piping inside of the federal government. There were particular pieces of information that had they been shared across the government could have been effectively used to keep the American people safe.\nSo the sharing of this information is critical. It's just critical that individuals who are entrusted with this information keep the commitment that they've made to the American people to protect it.\nLet me close by saying that these are the kinds of risks that our government has faced since the -- well, at least for a very long time. And we were talking a little bit earlier about\n-- again, an entirely different case -- but a situation about 15 years ago where there was an individual who was arrested by U.S. officials because he was accused of stealing sensitive information and passing it on to the Russians. This is the Hanssen case.\nSo the case of Mr. Snowden and this individual is unique. Each is unique. Obviously, the Snowden case got some extra attention because, frankly, he was so publicly on the lam. But this is something that our government has been confronting for a long time, and it's something that in some ways is even more complicated, given the modern communications tools that we have access to now that make it easier to pass this information along. Again, there's a benefit to that in terms of enhancing information-sharing, but there's a risk. And that is a risk that we're working very diligently to mitigate.\nQ: Does the administration see this latest case as serious as the Snowden case? Or is it too early to make that comparison?\nMR. EARNEST: I think it's certainly too early for me to draw that kind of connection or to offer up that kind of an assessment. But our investigators at the Department of Justice are conducting their own independent investigation, and they will do so with a sense of urgency because they recognize how significant the stakes are in cases like this. But I'll let them speak to what they've learned and offer an assessment, if they're prepared to do so, about just how serious it is.\nRoberta.\nQ: Does the President intend to do anything to try to prevent Aleppo from falling?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Roberta, the United States has been deeply engaged in international diplomacy to reduce the violence in Syria. We've obviously been involved in that effort for a number of years now. The United States, just yesterday, participated in an ISSG meeting. This is the International Syria Support Group that was convened. This is a group of a couple dozen countries who are concerned about the situation in Syria and that have assessed that they have a significant national interest in resolving the situation inside of Syria. And the United States has worked effectively in a leadership role in that group to try to bring the international community together around some potential solutions.\nI can tell you that U.S. officials I believe were meeting today with our European allies in Europe to discuss the situation inside of Syria. This is the so-called Quint meeting that was held at a variety of levels. But the focus of those discussions today was on the situation in Syria.\nThe United States is obviously very focused on supporting U.N.-led efforts, and there are a variety of those. There's obviously the efforts that are underway by U.N. Special Envoy, Mr. de Mistura, to try to reduce the violence inside of Syria. And there's also been extensive work that's been done at the United Nations Security Council over the years to try to focus the international community on potential solutions inside of Syria and on Aleppo in particular.\nWe continue to be deeply concerned about the tactics used by the Assad regime and the Russians that are focused on harming civilians, and it's deeply troubling what's happening there. And the United States has been deeply engaged through diplomacy around the world to try to address it.\nQ: But I guess, very specifically, on the immediate threat that faces Aleppo -- is the United States, is the President considering doing anything to try to prevent it from falling, beyond diplomacy and sort of a broader effort?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, Roberta, our conclusion about the root cause of the chaos inside of Syria is that there is no military solution to the many problems that are plaguing Syria. And we are working urgently to end the violence in Syria and in Aleppo through diplomatic channels. We have been very focused on that through all the channels that I just described.\nThere is an important role for the United States military to play in terms of leading a counter-ISIL coalition, and those military efforts have moved aggressively to roll back territory that ISIL previously controlled and to apply significant pressure to the leadership of ISIL and other extremist organizations that are operating inside of Syria. In fact, the Department of Defense announced earlier this week that a senior al Qaeda leader in Syria was the target of a military strike. That's an indication of the vigilance that is being exercised by the United States military as they try to keep the American people safe.\nSo our military is deeply engaged in the counter-ISIL campaign, but we're also trying to address the root cause of all this chaos, which is the political situation inside of Syria. And we're working diligently through diplomatic channels to try to reduce the violence and increase the flow of humanitarian assistance.\nQ: And just briefly, 44 Afghan troops who are in the United States for military training have gone missing over the past two years, presumably to live and perhaps work illegally in the United States. I guess I'm wondering how concerned is the White House about the questions that this will raise about training and security, given that they were training with the DOD and have sort of gone AWOL.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Roberta, I can't speak to any individual cases, but I would refer you to my colleagues at the Department of Defense who may have more information on this one.\nMichelle.\nQ: I just want to read to you something that just came in this morning from FBI sources. I just lost it, so give me one second. Here it is, okay. So the FBI believes Harold T. Martin III has been illegally taking home classified information for years. When they raided his property, they found thousands of pages of classified documents, hundreds of thumb drives, hard drives, dozens of computers and servers. He appeared to have his own server farm, enough to operate his own cloud.\nSo I think it's one thing if he started doing this last week and they suddenly caught him. I mean, I know he's been in custody for two weeks, if this was a recent thing. But the fact that the FBI believes he's been illegally taking home classified information for years -- and you listed a number of changes that were made after the Snowden case -- so how do you have any confidence that all the changes that were made are really doing anything if this person was able to do this, it's believed, for that amount of time?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Michelle, I'm not going to be able to discuss any additional details about what the FBI or investigators have been able to find. So I'll leave it to them to disclose exactly what those investigations have uncovered so far. Those investigations are obviously ongoing.\nThe kind of steps that we have taken to mitigate against so-called insider threats are significant, and they have made some progress in terms of accomplishing some of our goals -- improving the background check system; reducing the number of people that have security clearances; making some technical changes to the kind of access that people are given to sensitive information. There are a variety of both intuitive and highly technical steps that we can take to try to limit this risk. But this is a risk that is always going to exist. That risk is more significant, given the kinds of technology that's available now that allows for the efficient transfer of information. Again, that is largely a good thing in terms of making the U.S. government more effective, integrating our defenses in a way that can have a positive impact on our national security. But it does include an inherent risk. And this is a risk that predates this kind of technology.\nI think what is unquestionably true is that the vast majority of the men and women in our intelligence community take very seriously the responsibility that they have to the American people to treat sensitive information protectively. They understand the consequences that protecting that information has for our national security. They understand that the effective use of that information enhances our national security.\nThese are individuals who, in some cases, have the kind of expertise that would allow them to collect a much larger paycheck in the private sector, but instead, they use that expertise to protect the American people in a government job. And that's a pretty clear indication of their patriotism.\nBut, look, for these individual cases, this is a risk that exists. And as the investigation moves forward, if there is more that we can learn about additional protections that we should put in place to prevent something like this from happening again, we certainly will learn from this situation. And if there are additional reforms that are worth implementing, then we won't hesitate to do so because the President has made this a genuine priority.\nQ: There just seems to be in such a secure operation, such a gaping hole. This person had the ability to take home classified information over the course of years. Wouldn't you agree that there's obviously a need for some different kind of changes than the ones that were already made?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there have been important changes that have been made and we've already seen some important, positive results from them. But we certainly will -- as more is learned about this case, as the investigation continues, part of this investigation will be understanding exactly how this person was able to evade detection and commit the crimes that are alleged. Then we'll want to learn from that and implement the kinds of reforms or solutions that would prevent others from doing the same thing.\nQ: Okay. And the latest voice that we've heard this week was from the U.N.'s Human Rights Chief calling, as others have, for a limit of the use of the veto in the Security Council. Does the U.S. support that? And does the administration think that that would actually do any good, especially at this point, to try to make changes in what's happening in Syria?\nMR. EARNEST: There certainly has been -- the United States has been disappointed at the way in which Russia, and, to a certain extent, China, have wielded their veto authority on the U.N. Security Council to blunt international efforts to limit the violence inside of Syria. We've been disappointed that they have used that veto to protect Assad. There have also been movements at the United Nations Security Council to raise concerns about the conduct of individuals in that conflict and to ensure that they are met with some accountability. Those accountability measures have been blocked by the Russians.\nSo we've been deeply concerned by the way that Russia has used its veto power on the U.N. Security Council to prevent as much action from the U.N. as we would like to see. I know there has been a broader and, in some ways, more esoteric discussion about proposed reforms of the U.N. Security Council and the way that it works. I know there have been some proposals to enlarge it. Our friends in India are certainly interested in benefitting from reforms like that. But as it relates to the situation inside of Syria, I think our concern -- our most urgent concern is with the way that Russia has used their veto authority on the Security Council at the United Nations.\nQ: So is that something that should be done and should be looked at more closely now? Or do you feel like now is not the time for that, that it's not really going to do anything at this point?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think many United Nations processes are characterized by the length of time it takes to complete them. And surely, the idea of reforming those processes is also likely to take a long time, too. So we've expressed in other contexts our support for a set of reforms that could make the United Nations more efficient, more effective, and potentially even more representative, but our focus right now is on trying to reduce the violence in an urgent situation inside of Syria.\nJustin.\nQ: I guess I wanted to follow on a couple things Michelle asked about. First, the reason that the veto conversation is particularly relevant is reports that the U.S. is considering sanctions against countries in response to chemical weapons use in Syria. I know that you never sort of talk about sanctions until they happen. But would the U.S. be willing to pursue sanctions with Europe and other allies outside of the framework of the U.N. to address concerns in Syria?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there are other examples of the United States being able to work effectively outside the auspices of the U.N. to implement sanctions in a coordinated fashion to maximize the impact of those sanctions. So the situation in Ukraine is obviously the best example, where the United States has been able to work effectively with our European allies to impose tough sanctions against Russia. Of course, I would be among the first to point out that the sanctions that we have imposed on Russia, in concert with our European allies, as a result of Russia's actions in Ukraine have not yet achieved the desired result. We haven't seen the change in strategy on the part of the Russians that we'd like to see in Ukraine. We haven't seen them indicate their clear respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine.\nBut we do know that those sanctions have had an impact on Russia's economy. Russia is paying the price for their actions inside of Ukraine. And that price is one that they have to pay because of the ability of the United States to work effectively with our European partners to impose those costs. That's something that we didn't do through the U.N. obviously because Russia has a veto on the U.N. Security Council.\nSo that's one example of where we have been willing to work outside the auspices of the United Nations, and in a way that has had an impact even if we have not yet achieved the desired result.\nSo what I would say is, our preference is always to work through the U.N. when it comes to implementing these sanctions because it means that even more countries are able to coordinate their actions with the United States, which essentially has a multiplier effect in terms of the strength of the sanctions and the size of the cost. But outside of -- we do have options, and we have demonstrated an ability to work outside of the U.N. to achieve a similar result.\nSo I guess the point is in this case I wouldn't rule out multilateral efforts outside of the U.N. to impose costs on Syria or Russia or others with regard to the situation inside of Syria. We've done that in the past. And I wouldn't take that off the table in terms of the options that the President may consider in this situation.\nQ: On the data theft. I know you talked to Michelle yesterday and then again this morning at some length about steps that you've taken, particularly related to federal contractors. But in both this and the Snowden case, these were contractors that were working for Booz Allen Hamilton, in particular, and so I'm wondering if this has inspired any sort of reevaluation on whether that firm should be involved in or receive U.S. government contracts on highly classified data if two of their employees engaged in huge theft.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware that the investigation that's been conducted thus far has detected any wrongdoing on the part of the company. So I'd refer questions about that to the Department of Justice. My guess is that since they're still in the midst of the investigation, they're not likely to talk about that a whole lot.\nBut, look, we want to learn as much as we can about this situation. And as I indicated to Michelle, if there are lessons that we can learn and reforms that can be implemented to prevent something like this from happening again, we certainly want to do that. But as long as we are sharing information with government employees, sensitive national security information that is critical to protecting the country, this kind of risk exists. But the risk of not sharing that information is even higher. And that's one of the lessons we learned after 9/11.\nQ: The GAO released a report yesterday that found that the Obama administration spends about $1 billion on PR annually, and that you guys have added 667 PR staffers during this administration and that their median salary was $90,000. This has raised some criticism from government groups and from critics on the right. So I'm wondering if you could maybe talk about why it's important for the administration to have added all those staffers and be spending that amount of money on PR.\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't seen the report so it's hard for me to assess the conclusions that they have reached. What I can just say in general is that the administration has made it a priority to interact with the public and interact with the press corps and to be as transparent as possible. And that is work that requires dedicated professionals who are interested in furthering that goal and helping the American people understand exactly what the administration is doing, what we have prioritized, and what our success has been in implementing the agenda laid out by President Obama.\nSo I think our track record on this is pretty strong, both in terms of the substantive progress that we've made but also in terms of the effective way in which we've been able to communicate with the American public. I think the American public and our democracy is well served by that. But there's not much that we do around here that isn't the source of vociferous criticism from those on the right. So they're certainly entitled to do that.\nRon.\nQ: Storm and FEMA. Do you have any more specifics about the size of scope or metrics of the federal response so far? I know that there have been teams and resources pre-positioned. Are we talking about hundreds of people, or dozens of people, or just what?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Ron, I don't have a whole lot of new metrics to share with you. I can certainly contact my colleagues at FEMA. I don't know if those are some of the people that were added to the GAO report or not, but --\nQ: The PR report.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, exactly. Those are the people who would find out that information for you. Let me see what we can do on that.\nBut I can provide you a little texture here, which is that there have been a number of resources that have been pre-deployed to the region. This is a relatively new strategy that's been implemented under the leadership of Administrator Fugate. The idea here is to essentially pre-stage supplies that are likely to be needed in areas that are just outside of the affected areas, so that after the storm passes these resources are all in one place and not too far away from where they're needed most. So that work has been going on for several days now, and we can provide you some additional information about the quantity of those supplies.\nThe other thing that I can tell you is that there are a number of coordination centers that have been set up, up and down the East Coast, and those coordination centers are now operating around the clock and are fully staffed. And that requires a lot of people to ensure that those operations can continue around the clock.\nThe other thing that we have prioritized, Ron -- and this is something that the President raised in his discussion with federal officials yesterday -- is his concern about potential power outages. Anytime you're dealing with a storm like this you want to try and get the power back up as soon as possible. That's certainly true in this case. So some of the supplies that are being mobilized are fuel for generators, for example, so that people who have emergency generators can get them up and running, but also so that critical facilities like hospitals can also fuel their generators.\nThere also has been a lot of important work done to pool the resources of utilities in regions of the country that are not affected by the storm so that they can share their personnel and their trucks and their equipment to help those communities that are experiencing some widespread devastation. And some of that coordination work has been done in advance, as well -- because this is obviously a priority that we're mindful of. Power is going to go out and people are going to be challenged to operate in an environment where the power is not on. We just want to do as much planning as we can in advance so that we can get it on as quickly as possible.\nQ: Have there been any disaster declarations yet, or requests? I believe the governor of Florida made a request.\nMR. EARNEST: He made a request for an emergency declaration, which is essentially a request that can be submitted to the federal government in advance of a storm. This is a relatively new innovation as well, again to expedite the provision of federal support in a situation like this. There is a process that FEMA considers when they receive and application like this. I know that they'll work quickly to evaluate it and respond.\nQ: They have not yet responded.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware that they have yet. But they will respond quickly.\nQ: Is there a presidential response with it?\nMR. EARNEST: What it is, is it is something that goes through FEMA first. The application is considered and processed there. I do believe there's a step that requires presidential signoff, but that is not a process that takes very long. The President relies heavily on the advice he receives from experts at FEMA.\nQ: Is there any consideration of the President altering his travel plans?\nMR. EARNEST: At this point, there's no plans on the part of the President to change his travel. He obviously is traveling to a part of the country that is not in the path of this storm. But even as the President travels he will stay closely attuned to federal officials who are the front lines of supporting the state and local officials who are leading the response. That's the proper role for the federal government in these situations. The federal government plays a supporting role in terms of providing supplies and offering advice. But ultimately it's the responsibility of state and local officials to manage the response.\nThat's why we're encouraging people right now to listen to the instructions of state and local officials. They know best about what's needed to protect their communities. They are also going to know what's best about what's needed to help their communities recover. And the role of the federal government is to support them as they do that important work.\nQ: Just on Aleppo. Is there a national security meeting -- is the President having any meetings today on that situation?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any formal presidential meetings like this. The President obviously has a PDB this morning. But the President meets regularly with his national security team. I don't have any details to share with you about any meetings today.\nQ: In the statement from the Syrian army last night warning civilians to get out, is it the -- is it the administration's assessment that Aleppo is about to fall? Is that conceivable in the way you see the situation there on the ground now? And is there a response that you have planned should that happen?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, first of all, I think it's outrageous that a military organization that has been attacking civilians for years, using barrel bombs, weaponized chemicals -- industrial chemicals like chlorine, bunker-busting bombs -- for them to suggest that somehow they're now looking out for the interests of civilians is outrageous.\nSo what I'll say in general is I think it's an indication of why the world is so concerned about the situation in Aleppo right now. I don't have an assessment to offer in terms of the latest conditions on the ground. But that is a city that's been under siege for years, and the pace of that siege and the intensity of that siege has only increased in the last couple of weeks. That's been deeply distressing. But I don't have an assessment to share in terms of how likely it is that that city will fall.\nQ: And there's nothing that you could say that might be more reassuring to the world community who is very concerned about this, about any contingency plans or any other -- we hear your statements about the horrific nature of all this all the time. A lot of people are looking for some sort of action, frankly, something tangible.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, Ron, I think the kind of action that I've been talking about is the conversations that we've been having through the auspices of the United Nations, trying to support the U.N. Envoy there; the conversation that we've been having with our European allies about the situation in Aleppo. There are a number of bilateral conversations that the United States has been engaged with our partners and friends in the region. So we've been very focused on this. And our goal has been to try to reduce the violence in Aleppo and expedite the provision of humanitarian assistance.\nThe United States has now provided about $5.9 billion in humanitarian assistance -- more than any other country in the world. So the United States has been engaged in trying to address the problems in Aleppo, and many other people around the world have been, as well.\nQ: But despite that, it's fair to say the situation just keeps getting worse.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we've been deeply concerned about the increasing pace of attacks from the Syrian army, with the support of the Russian military. That's been deeply distressing.\nQ: So it's your position that U.S. response has been adequate, appropriate?\nMR. EARNEST: Ron, I don't think there's anybody satisfied when you see such widespread death and destruction. The blood that has been shed by innocent civilians -- men, women and children -- has been deeply distressing. And I don't think there's anybody that feels good about the situation in Aleppo right now.\nRich.\nQ: Josh, just to get inside some of the conversations that he's having with FEMA and with others in the administration dealing with the storm, is it the administration's viewpoint that there is the chance that this could be the most significant, damaging weather event that the administration has had to deal with, and the potential that these local officials, who are the ones who are responsible for handling the immediate response, will turn to the federal government if there are large groups of people displaced and a great need for resources?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Rich, what the scientists tell us is that this is likely the largest and most powerful hurricane to hit the United States in a decade or so. And the preparations that we have been making in advance of the storm I think are indicative of just how serious we think it is. That's why you've seen such a forceful response mobilized by the federal government even in advance of the storm making landfall. We've seen a similar response from state and local officials, and that's a positive thing as well.\nBut this is something that -- this is a storm that people should take seriously. The federal government is taking it seriously. And it's important for people who live in the path of the storm to take it quite seriously as well.\nQ: Have there been any conversations yet -- I might be getting a little ahead -- but if there's a need for additional appropriation -- with Congress out? Have there been those discussions with congressional leaders at all?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of those discussions at this point. What we typically will do is do a damage assessment to determine just how significant the losses are. And from there, we can make a determination about whether or not it is necessary for Congress to consider an additional appropriation.\nQ: Turning to the President's piece on the economy in The Economist. He talks about expressions of Americans now are echoes of the past. He talks about \"know-nothingism\" -- which I assume is a shot, perhaps, more at those who support Donald Trump. But he does talk about how, as appealing as some more radical reforms can sound, the abstract of breaking up all the biggest banks who are erecting prohibitively steep tariffs on imports, on the economy, is not an abstraction. In writing this, does the President see that sentiment equally spread among Democrats and Republicans?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the President addresses this directly in the piece, which is that this sentiment is more widespread on the right than it is on the left, but it is a phenomenon on the extremes of both ends of the ideological spectrum. And I think the President makes a pretty persuasive, if detailed, case for the kinds of things that we can do to address the concerns that have been raised. I think the President's view is that the concerns that have been raised are legitimate. Some of the proposed responses that we've seen from the extremes on both ends are not and, in some cases, would end up doing more damage, would compound the negative impacts of globalization that are being experienced by some communities.\nAnd there actually are some things we can do to try to compound the positive impacts of the forces of globalization. Let me just give you one example. The article itself is quite long, and I commend it to everyone's attention. I won't repeat all of the case that the President makes, but one example of this would be investments in education. We know, in an increasingly integrated global economy, those who have marketable, highly technical skills are in a position to succeed as a result of the global economy. We know that jobs that are tied to the international economy, that are tied to exports here in the United States pay substantially more than the average job that's not tied to exports. So why wouldn't we make the kinds of investments that would ensure that our workforce can benefit from that kind of opportunity?\nSo let's make sure that we're investing in early childhood education. Let's make sure we open up the doors to a college education to every middle-class family and every family that's working hard to get into the middle class. Let's do more to give individuals who are ready to make a mid-career shift get the kind of job training that they need to qualify for these higher-paying jobs. That's the kind of common-sense approach that the President advocates.\nThere are others who say that we should respond to this situation by trying to close the U.S. economy off from the global supply chain. That would have a terrible impact on our broader economy, but it also would reduce the number of jobs that are tied to exports, which means that there's a smaller number of higher-paying jobs to be gained.\nSo it's important that we focus on specific, rather common-sense strategies for compounding the positive benefits to some of these global changes in the economy, as opposed to making the negative consequences even worse.\nQ: The President also talks about many of the positive points of the economy. We're not at a point where we're losing 700,000 jobs monthly; income gains. But there still are issues out there -- GDP growth between 1 and 2 percent; a federal funds rate that the Fed views as an economy that isn't strong enough to support a target rate of higher than a quarter to a half-percent. Is an issue here also that just -- that growth just, broad based, isn't just strong enough yet?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we know that one of the headwinds that we face for growth here in the United States is actually from the weakened international economy. The United States benefits from being able to trade with the world. And when our trading partners have economies that aren't performing at particularly high levels, that's going to have an impact on the number of goods and services they purchase from the United States. So that certainly is part of it, and that's why much of the audience for this piece is the international community, international policymakers, international business leaders who can have an impact on some of these broader trends.\nI think what's also true, Rich, is that we've encountered opposition from those on the extreme right who wield inordinate influence in the United States Congress. They have succeeded in blocking the kind of common-sense investments in infrastructure and education that would have a material, positive impact on economic growth. Economic growth would be higher if Republicans hadn't blocked policies that contribute to economic growth.\nSo I know that at the risk of offending my friends with years of technical education in the field of economics, this isn't that complicated. And it's the opposition to common-sense proposals like investments in education and investments in infrastructure that have prevented the U.S. economy from performing even better than we have thus far. And again, I guess that's where the allusion to the \"know-nothings\" might come in.\nJordan.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. On the hurricane. The Obama administration and Governor Scott have sparred in the past over disaster relief and emergency funding. I believe that Governor Scott has the far higher rejection rate for emergency funding requests of FEMA than other states and governors around the country. So given that, can you describe that administration's interaction with Governor Scott's administration thus far on this storm, and describe how those interactions have been?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Jordan, when we're talking about millions of Americans who are in the path of a potentially devastating storm, the likes of which we haven't seen in the United States in about a decade or so, we put partisan politics aside and we focus on making sure that we're meeting the basic needs of our fellow Americans.\nSo there's been extensive coordination between federal officials and state emergency officials in Florida. Those of you who follow these issues closely know that Craig Fugate is a Floridian himself, and he burnished his reputation as an expert in emergency management in helping the state of Florida, in 2004 and 2005, deal with an unprecedented series of hurricanes that struck his state.\nMy personal experience with this is in 2006, 10 years ago now, I was working on the Florida governor's race for the Democratic candidate for governor, and one of the principal talking points of both the Democratic and Republican candidate for governor was to promise to leave Craig Fugate in his job. So I think that's a pretty clear indication that Mr. Fugate doesn't consider politics when doing his job.\nI'm sure that contributes to the success that he has enjoyed in terms of providing service to the American people. But that's also been the approach that President Obama has taken as well. And we would expect that the significant political differences that exist between Governor Scott and the White House are going to have zero impact on the ability of emergency officials in Florida to get the kind of help and support and assistance they need from federal officials when dealing with this storm.\nKaren.\nQ: Josh, can you give us an update on what the U.S. is doing in Haiti? The pictures coming in are showing just massive destruction. There's a lot of areas that are completely cut off right now. I think earlier in the week there was talk about helicopters going down and getting supplies to the capital, but is there an update you can give on resources that have been sent or are going to be sent there?\nMR. EARNEST: I know that my colleagues at the Department of Defense can talk to you about some of the resources that have been mobilized. Military resources have been mobilized to assist in recovery efforts in Haiti. I don't have those statistics in front of me, but we can certainly get you some more information about that. There's also been some important work done through USAID to deal with the impact of the storm.\nUSAID Foreign Disaster Assistance Teams were actually deployed to both Haiti and Jamaica and the Bahamas in advance of the storm hitting, so there are already disaster recovery experts from the United States on the ground in these places to assist these local governments in setting up a recovery effort. There has been an initial contribution from USAID of $1.5 million to address some of the immediate humanitarian needs in the aftermath of the hurricane. But that's just an initial payment and I'm sure that there will be additional resources that will come from the U.S. government to assist our friends in Haiti who are dealing with a very difficult situation.\nBut I just want to mention once again, there's an opportunity for Americans who might be concerned about the situation there -- they can go to CIDI.org. This is a nonprofit organization that is dedicated to disseminating information in the aftermath of disasters and they also can ensure that financial resources that are dedicated to the recovery effort get to the right place and are used effectively.\nQ: You talked a lot -- you've had a lot of statements this week about the U.S.-Russia relationship -- the plutonium deal, the diplomatic talks over Syria. This morning, there's a seemingly extraordinary statement from a spokesman for the Russian Defense Minister strongly warning the U.S. to not make any attempts to conduct military strikes against Assad regime targets in Syria, being taken as threatening to shoot down American planes if the U.S. tries to do that. What's the White House response?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I haven't seen that statement. What I will say is there was a concerted effort on the part of the United States to try to work effectively with the Russians to reduce violence inside of Syria and, time and time again, the Russians did not live up to the commitments that they had made in the context of those negotiations. That was a source of deep disappointment not just here in the United States but around the world. And it's had tragic consequences for innocent civilians in and around Aleppo.\nAt the same time, there's no interest on the part of the United States in escalating the violence in Syria. We actually want to see the violence and the conflict reduced, and that's what we're working so diligently through diplomatic channels to try to effect.\nGardiner.\nQ: Josh, this administration has prosecuted more leaked cases than all previous Presidents combined. And this administration has suffered three of the largest thefts of classified information in American history -- this one, the Wikileaks one, and the Snowden one. Has the administration's crackdown been a failure?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Gardiner, we can walk through the statistics about the leak prosecutions. I think what is clear is that the administration does take quite seriously the need to protect sensitive national security information. Of course, those decisions about how and whether to prosecute an individual are made by officials at the Department of Justice. Those decisions are made without any sort of political influence. Of course, there is general policy direction that does come from the White House about the priority placed on protecting national security and protecting sensitive information, but those prosecutorial decisions are made by independent prosecutors at the Department of Justice.\nMore generally, I think that what we have seen, Gardiner, is the impact that modern technology has on the movement and dissemination of information. There's an upside; that technology can be used to ensure that national security information can be quickly, instantaneously shared across the federal government in a way that keeps our men and women in uniform safe, in a way that aids terrorism investigations being conducted by the United States and our allies around the world, and in a way that protects the United States homeland.\nThe downside risk of this technology is that those with bad intentions can, on an unprecedented scale, disseminate that information. And, unfortunately, that has harmful consequences. We've talked in here at length about the way that Mr. Snowden's unauthorized disclosures put Americans in harm's way, whether that's compromising the identity of undercover intelligence operatives, or unauthorized disclosure of information that has an impact on the safety and security of our men and women in uniform. That's the modern environment in which we're operating.\nAnd that's why the administration has undertaken so many of the reform efforts that I described to Michelle to try to counter this insider threat. And as we learn more about ways that bad actors evade those reforms we'll learn those lessons, we'll beef up our defenses even further. But it continues to be the belief -- not just of this administration, but of national security professionals in both parties -- that the greater risk is associated with withholding that information and not effectively sharing it.\nAnd this was one of the lessons that we learned in the aftermath of 9/11, that the internal stove-piping in the federal government detracted from our national security. And there has been a concerted effort to more effectively share that information to protect the American people. That has been a good thing. That has been a -- that has revolutionized the way that intelligence information is used to protect our interests and to protect our country. But it has also caused us to confront this most latest, most recent risk.\nQ: Josh, you talked about waiting until the investigation is done to undertake further reforms. But given that this guy seemed to defy so many of the reforms that were implemented post-Snowden in 2014 -- the two-person rule, the no-thumb-drive rule\n-- isn't there just an extraordinary urgency that this administration needs to have right now about reminding the entire federal government in sort of a hair-on-fire way that these rules are in place and cannot be defied?\nMR. EARNEST: Let me assure you that there is a sense of urgency around this. And I did not mean to leave you with the impression that we're not going to do anything until the investigation is completed. If over the course of the investigation we learn information that could be valuable in patching vulnerabilities, we will undertake that work immediately.\nWhat I think is also true is that the vast majority of the men and women in our intelligence community -- our people, our experts, are professionals -- who take these rules very seriously. They're patriotic Americans who dedicate their lives to protecting this country. And they have a valuable expertise that they use to protect this country. So the vast majority of them don't need to be reminded of just how serious this is.\nBut I think everybody who serves in the intelligence community recognizes the grave consequences for not following the rules that are on the books. And, again, I say that without knowing exactly -- or at least without being able to discuss in detail what we know about this particular situation.\nBut it's hard -- let me clarify. The point is this: It's not clear in this situation whether these alleged crimes were committed because the rules weren't being effectively followed, or if there was a creative way for getting around the rules. But either way, if there are reforms that we can implement to either ensure greater fidelity to these policies or further strengthening of these policies, we'll do that to ensure the safety and security of the sensitive information.\nQ: Are you confident right now that you have the boundaries of this leak understood and under control -- in other words, that you are fairly secure that you know who leaked the NSA intercept details and the recent NSA computer codes and that you've got all of that stopped? Do you have confidence that this is now under control, the leaks are plugged, and you've got everyone that you need to get in this investigation?\nMR. EARNEST: I think that's an entirely legitimate question, but it's one that's going to have to be directed to my colleagues at the Department of Justice. They're the ones that are conducting the investigation, and so I'll let them speak to the scope of it.\nQ: Do you know what contractor this guy worked for prior to Booz? Because I think part of this took place prior to his Booz -- is that also details that --\nMR. EARNEST: I can't speak to this individual's employment history, but that may be a detail that the Department of Justice can share with you.\nQ: Okay.\nMR. EARNEST: Sarah.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. So today a poll came out from CNN showing that the President's approval rating is at 55 percent, which is the highest of his second term.\nMR. EARNEST: Thank you for mentioning it. (Laughter.)\nQ: Sure. I thought you might appreciate that.\nMR. EARNEST: It's a little awkward for me to do that from up here. (Laughter.) I take some pride in it, nonetheless.\nQ: But it's been turning upward since earlier this year. And just from a macro perspective, it seems perhaps a little counterintuitive given that the other trend that we've seen in this election is this thirst for change. And so I'm just wondering if the President has any insight into what's at play there.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I'll let you guys do the important work of analyzing the polls, and lord knows, there are plenty of people who are volunteering for that responsibility. What I will say is that the President is enormously proud of the progress that we've made in this country over the last eight years. When President Obama took office, he obviously encountered the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, and the progress that we have made over the last seven and a half, almost eight years, is remarkable and I think was better than anybody had predicted seven and a half years ago.\nThe kind of sustained job creation that we've seen in this country, the longest consecutive monthly streak in our history; the progress that we made in putting upward pressure on wages; the success that we've had in reducing poverty -- poverty fell more in 2015 than it has in any year since the 1960s and the increase in median wages in this country in 2015 was the greatest -- or the largest on record.\nSo that's an indication that we really have made critically important progress. And the President has always -- the President's approach has always been to focus on longer-term goals, and there are situations in which that longer-term focus has had an impact on the numbers reflected in short term polls. But the President has been willing to sacrifice the hot takes for longer-term results. And after eight years in this office, I think that is a strategy that has strongly benefited the American people and it's starting to show up in the polls. And the President does take some satisfaction with that.\nIn terms of sort of reconciling I think the unquestioned desire for some changes in our government, I think you won't be surprised to hear me say that I would attribute that to the dysfunction that has run rampant under Republican leadership in Congress. And that has contributed to deep frustration not just inside the White House, but in houses all across the country, that Congress has failed time and time again to do common-sense things that would be good for the country because Republicans continually prioritize politics.\nAnd whether that is the kind of common-sense investments in infrastructure and education that would have a positive economic impact, or the kind of common-sense reforms of our immigration system -- there are a variety of ways to measure the congressional dysfunction in a way that's left people quite dissatisfied with the way they're being represented in Washington, D.C. right now.\nSo I recognize there may be some Republicans with a different analysis, but you got to admit that the analysis that I've just offered is backed up by the numbers.\nQ: But both presidential candidates also have kind of historically high negative ratings, in addition to Congress and the media. But so is the President's popularity actually just organically people liking Barack Obama, or is it sort of in comparison -- people are expressing their --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think it's probably a little bit of both. I think that people are pleased with the President's performance in office, and that's reflected in the polls you saw today. I think the President has always maintained a personal approval rating even among those who don't support his policies because they see the approach that he's taken to his job -- even if that hasn't led to the kind of policy outcomes that they would like to see.\nBut they see the President as somebody who actually can be a role model to our kids. They see somebody who is a good husband and a good father. They see somebody who is serious about his faith. They see somebody who takes his job very seriously, but himself not more seriously than necessary. So I think the public's appraisal of the President's character is one that even in the most difficult times has been pretty durable.\nAnd I think people are reminded of that when they hear some of the rhetoric that's uttered by the Republican nominee for President. And I think that might lead some Republicans and independents to conclude that for as frustrated as they are with Washington right now, they've been pleased with the decisions that the guy sitting in the Oval Office has been making.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, in the new relationship with Cuba, and Dr. Biden traveling there, was there any -- can we anticipate any kind of offer to help them with hurricane recovery?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any changes for Dr. Biden's schedule, but given the impact that the storm has had in that region of the world, I would anticipate that will be an added feature of her trip, that she'll be talking about work that the United States can do to help those who are recovering from the storm.\nQ: Under the status of the relationship now, any kind of aid to help with that relief is permitted?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not sure of the kinds of rules that would govern that kind of assistance, but we can certainly look into that for you.\nQ: Question for you. When you were talking about Syria, and you mentioned the support for diplomacy, including that of the U.N., were you specifically supporting the proposal from the U.N. Envoy de Mistura to go into Aleppo himself to help escort out those who were fleeing that city?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I was not referring to any specific statement or initiative from Mr. de Mistura, rather our general support for the tireless efforts that he has led to focus international attention on this trouble situation and to try to find a solution. He's done important work. And he's preserved the kind of -- he's played an important role in trying to bring the international community together around some constructive ideas for addressing some potential solutions. We haven't found it yet with regard to the situation in Aleppo, but that has not prevented him from working tirelessly and in good faith to try to find that solution.\nQ: Wouldn't you say that's kind of an extraordinary offer in terms of the sense of urgency being felt there right now that the diplomacy otherwise has not led to anything that would provide immediate relief, so now he would offer to go in himself?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, it is an extraordinary offer. Again, it's hard to know whether or not that's a rhetorical device that he was using to express his own personal sense of urgency;, or if he was packing his luggage. You'd have to ask him what his intent was. But I think that regardless of what specifically his message was, I think he's conveying a sense of urgency that many people, including the President of the United States, feel.\nQ: And can I just ask you, you said the other day from the podium that there was nothing left to be discussed with the Russians and that the U.S. was severing these -- suspending these talks. But John Kerry is back talking to Sergey Lavrov now. What made the President decide to, say, start talking to Russia again about Syria?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'll let my colleagues at the State Department read out the nature of those conversations. What we have said all along is that there are a variety of aspects to the relationship between the United States and Russia and they talk about a lot of things.\nQ: But they said a big part of it was Syria in the readout today.\nMR. EARNEST: So, again, I'll let them talk about the details of what was discussed. What I can tell you that they were not talking about is trying to reinstitute the kind of Cessation of Hostilities agreement that we thought we instituted a month or so ago but it failed because of Russia's repeated and violent abrogation of the commitments that they had made in the context of those talks.\nQ: So, just to be clear. When you were talking about suspending, you were specifically only talking about the U.S. offer of potential military coordination with Russia? That's off the table. That's not be revisited. But we can still talk about Russia -- about other diplomatic initiatives in Syria? Is that what you're saying?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously Russia is going to have to be a part of any sort of U.N. process because they sit on the Security Council. Russia is a member of the International Syria Support Group. That is another multilateral institution that we have -- or another multilateral venue where the United States has tried to find a solution. Russia has been a part of those, as well. We've never indicated that we were shutting off all diplomatic ties with Russia. But we did make clear that Russia had too often, and repeatedly, violated the kinds of commitments that they had made that made it unnecessary or unworkable to continue to pursue that specific approach.\nBut there are a variety of other ways in which Russia is involved, and they will continue to be. But the kind of arrangement that we had envisioned of getting Russia to play a constructive role in reducing violence in exchange for closer Russian-U.S. military cooperation going after extremists is an agreement that never materialized, unfortunately.\nQ: When you said the U.S. has no interest in escalating the violence in Syria, were you -- specifically in response to the question about Russia's sort of bellicose statements lately\n-- were you basically saying, we've got nothing to worry about, the U.S. won't be using any kind of military force in any form or fashion?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what I'm saying is that the -- I'm not going to be in a position where I'm taking options off the table for the Commander-in-Chief. I think I've discussed at some detail -- I think the President has discussed in some detail why military action against the Assad regime to try to address the situation in Aleppo is unlikely to accomplish the goals that many envision now in terms of reducing the violence there, and is much more likely to lead to a bunch of unintended consequences that are clearly not in our national interest.\nBut I'm not going to take any options off the table. And I think what I'm articulating is a desire to deescalate the situation inside of Syria, to deescalate the conflict, to reduce the violence, and try to bring some much-needed humanitarian assistance to those who need it the most.\nJohn.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. Two questions. First -- and I hope I'm saying the name right -- Dr. Zaher Sahloul of the American Relief Committee for Syria, when he appeared on the France 24 debate on Tuesday night, said that what is happening in Syria was reminiscent on Sarajevo and Srebrenica, and he called it ethnic cleansing. Is that the administration's official opinion of what is happening in Syria -- ethnic cleansing, as well?\nMR. EARNEST: I have not seen that label be used in this particular situation. Obviously, we have been deeply concerned about the widespread violence that's been perpetrated against innocent civilians. In some cases, that violence has been motivated by religious differences, and that's deeply troubling. You've heard the State Department talk about how the increased violence in the region has fueled extremism, and has created a situation in which there are populations that are at risk of genocide.\nSo the situation inside of Syria is a deeply troubling one, both because of the actions -- both as a direct consequence of the actions of the Assad regime, but also the second and third order of consequences of their actions that have only contributed to a sense of chaos there that's fueled extremism, that has worsened the kind of sectarian conflict there that has cost too many innocent lives already. And we're deeply concerned about the potential of a further escalation in violence.\nQ: Does the administration agree with former President Clinton that the Affordable Care Act needs tinkering and fixing?\nMR. EARNEST: John, the very day that the President signed the Affordable Care Act into law, he indicated a commitment, a willingness to work with Democrats or Republicans on Capitol Hill who had good ideas for further strengthening the law. The Affordable Care Act has provided enormous benefits. Twenty million Americans have health insurance that didn't have it before the Affordable Care Act went into effect. Millions more Americans benefit from the consumer protections associated with not being discriminated against because they have a preexisting condition; not being charged more because you're a woman; not being dragged into bankruptcy court because somebody in your family gets sick; not getting kicked off your health insurance because you get sick.\nThere are all consumer protections that are available to tens of millions of Americans. These are consumer protections that weren't available before. So the Affordable Care Act has had an enormously positive impact on the country. But if there are other things that we can do to further strengthen the Affordable Care Act -- the President has talked about the idea of adding a public option that could make state-based marketplaces even more competitive and give consumers even more options -- that obviously would be one way we could strengthen the law.\nBut, ultimately, it requires congressional action. And we'll have to see if Congress is -- Republicans in Congress are willing to consider anything other than just repealing the law, which would repeal all those consumer protections that I just talked about. So the President strongly opposes the idea of repealing the law, but he's willing to work with Republicans if they're prepared to work with him to strengthen it.\nQ: So he agrees with President Clinton on that? That it needs some fixing and he's willing to do it?\nMR. EARNEST: Considering that President Obama said it six years ago, I think it would be fair to say that President Clinton agrees with President Obama.\nPam, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Okay, the Trump campaign put out a statement calling the Paris Climate Accord just another bad deal, saying it will cost the American economy trillions of dollars, impose a higher electricity cost for Americans, and gives China an edge because it allows China to keep raising their emissions for a dozen years. Do you want to respond to that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the benefits associated with the international agreement, the historic agreement to cut carbon pollution are significant for the United States both in terms of the impact it will have on the environment but also in terms of the impact it will have on our economy.\nChina, for the first time, because of tough, principled diplomacy on the part of the United States, agreed for the first time to limit their emissions. You'll recall that Republicans' chief criticism of any effort to undertake a reduction in carbon pollution by the United States was that China would never go along with it. They were wrong about that. We just needed somebody who was tough enough to go and negotiate a smart deal with the Chinese, which is exactly what the Obama administration did. And as a result, that catalyzed the international community to also make commitments that, again, will have a positive impact on reducing carbon pollution and have a positive impact on the health of the planet.\nWhat this will also do is send a very clear, unmistakable market signal to entrepreneurs in the clean energy sector -- 196 countries have now made a commitment to reduce their carbon pollution. That means they are on the market for figuring out how to produce energy and reduce their carbon pollution. That is a wide-open market for people who have an innovative approach to solar energy or wind energy, hydroelectric energy. That is an open market to people that have -- are ready to take to market new battery technology or other forms of improved energy efficiency. That's no longer a niche market; that is now a global market.\nAnd the President is determined to make sure that the United States is at the cutting edge of that market. And that's why the U.S. government, in the context of the Recovery Act, supported so many loans to the clean energy sector, and it's why the United States is now poised to benefit from the kind of commitments that countries are making all around -- that countries all around the world are making. And that's a good thing, and that's why this agreement is one that isn't just good for our planet -- it's going to end up being a really good thing for the U.S. economy.\nQ: And one more. NOAA says that there have been 12 weather events so far this year that cost a billion dollars. Any concern about the impact on the economy on these kinds of weather events or the government's ability to continue funding disaster assistance? And there have been a string of small earthquakes in California, raising concern about a big one coming. Have there been any special preparations for that?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any earthquake preparations that are underway. I think I'd refer you to officials at the U.S. Geological Service or in California about that. As it relates to the potential economic impact of the storm, that's something that we're always mindful of. And some of the cities and the potential path of the storm have large populations. And displacing large populations can have a negative impact on the economy. So we'll certainly watch that, but we're also prepared to mobilize significant financial resources to help those communities recover as quickly as possible and get life back to normal as quickly as possible. So we've done a lot of preparation in advance of that, and we intend to work closely with state and local officials to make that happen.\nThanks, everybody. Have a good rest of the day.\nEND 12:10 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2016-10-06", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "APP NOTE: This essay was released by the White House Office of the Press Secretary as a press release.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=121754", "text": "Barack Obama: The way ahead\nBy: President Obama\nWherever I go these days, at home or abroad, people ask me the same question: what is happening in the American political system? How has a country that has benefited—perhaps more than any other—from immigration, trade and technological innovation suddenly developed a strain of anti-immigrant, anti-innovation protectionism? Why have some on the far left and even more on the far right embraced a crude populism that promises a return to a past that is not possible to restore—and that, for most Americans, never existed at all?\nIt's true that a certain anxiety over the forces of globalisation, immigration, technology, even change itself, has taken hold in America. It's not new, nor is it dissimilar to a discontent spreading throughout the world, often manifested in scepticism towards international institutions, trade agreements and immigration. It can be seen in Britain's recent vote to leave the European Union and the rise of populist parties around the world.\nMuch of this discontent is driven by fears that are not fundamentally economic. The anti-immigrant, anti-Mexican, anti-Muslim and anti-refugee sentiment expressed by some Americans today echoes nativist lurches of the past—the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798, the Know-Nothings of the mid-1800s, the anti-Asian sentiment in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and any number of eras in which Americans were told they could restore past glory if they just got some group or idea that was threatening America under control. We overcame those fears and we will again.\nBut some of the discontent is rooted in legitimate concerns about long-term economic forces. Decades of declining productivity growth and rising inequality have resulted in slower income growth for low- and middle-income families. Globalisation and automation have weakened the position of workers and their ability to secure a decent wage. Too many potential physicists and engineers spend their careers shifting money around in the financial sector, instead of applying their talents to innovating in the real economy. And the financial crisis of 2008 only seemed to increase the isolation of corporations and elites, who often seem to live by a different set of rules to ordinary citizens.\nSo it's no wonder that so many are receptive to the argument that the game is rigged. But amid this understandable frustration, much of it fanned by politicians who would actually make the problem worse rather than better, it is important to remember that capitalism has been the greatest driver of prosperity and opportunity the world has ever known.\nOver the past 25 years, the proportion of people living in extreme poverty has fallen from nearly 40% to under 10%. Last year, American households enjoyed the largest income gains on record and the poverty rate fell faster than at any point since the 1960s. Wages have risen faster in real terms during this business cycle than in any since the 1970s. These gains would have been impossible without the globalisation and technological transformation that drives some of the anxiety behind our current political debate.\nThis is the paradox that defines our world today. The world is more prosperous than ever before and yet our societies are marked by uncertainty and unease. So we have a choice—retreat into old, closed-off economies or press forwards, acknowledging the inequality that can come with globalisation while committing ourselves to making the global economy work better for all people, not just those at the top.\nA force for good\nThe profit motive can be a powerful force for the common good, driving businesses to create products that consumers rave about or motivating banks to lend to growing businesses. But, by itself, this will not lead to broadly shared prosperity and growth. Economists have long recognised that markets, left to their own devices, can fail. This can happen through the tendency towards monopoly and rent-seeking that this newspaper has documented, the failure of businesses to take into account the impact of their decisions on others through pollution, the ways in which disparities of information can leave consumers vulnerable to dangerous products or overly expensive health insurance.\nMore fundamentally, a capitalism shaped by the few and unaccountable to the many is a threat to all. Economies are more successful when we close the gap between rich and poor and growth is broadly based. A world in which 1% of humanity controls as much wealth as the other 99% will never be stable. Gaps between rich and poor are not new but just as the child in a slum can see the skyscraper nearby, technology allows anyone with a smartphone to see how the most privileged live. Expectations rise faster than governments can deliver and a pervasive sense of injustice undermines peoples' faith in the system. Without trust, capitalism and markets cannot continue to deliver the gains they have delivered in the past centuries.\nThis paradox of progress and peril has been decades in the making. While I am proud of what my administration has accomplished these past eight years, I have always acknowledged that the work of perfecting our union would take far longer. The presidency is a relay race, requiring each of us to do our part to bring the country closer to its highest aspirations. So where does my successor go from here?\nFurther progress requires recognising that America's economy is an enormously complicated mechanism. As appealing as some more radical reforms can sound in the abstract—breaking up all the biggest banks or erecting prohibitively steep tariffs on imports—the economy is not an abstraction. It cannot simply be redesigned wholesale and put back together again without real consequences for real people.\nInstead, fully restoring faith in an economy where hardworking Americans can get ahead requires addressing four major structural challenges: boosting productivity growth, combating rising inequality, ensuring that everyone who wants a job can get one and building a resilient economy that's primed for future growth.\nRestoring economic dynamism\nFirst, in recent years, we have seen incredible technological advances through the internet, mobile broadband and devices, artificial intelligence, robotics, advanced materials, improvements in energy efficiency and personalised medicine. But while these innovations have changed lives, they have not yet substantially boosted measured productivity growth. Over the past decade, America has enjoyed the fastest productivity growth in the G7, but it has slowed across nearly all advanced economies (see chart 1). Without a faster-growing economy, we will not be able to generate the wage gains people want, regardless of how we divide up the pie.\nA major source of the recent productivity slowdown has been a shortfall of public and private investment caused, in part, by a hangover from the financial crisis. But it has also been caused by self-imposed constraints: an anti-tax ideology that rejects virtually all sources of new public funding; a fixation on deficits at the expense of the deferred maintenance bills we are passing to our children, particularly for infrastructure; and a political system so partisan that previously bipartisan ideas like bridge and airport upgrades are nonstarters.\nWe could also help private investment and innovation with business-tax reform that lowers statutory rates and closes loopholes, and with public investments in basic research and development. Policies focused on education are critical both for increasing economic growth and for ensuring that it is shared broadly. These include everything from boosting funding for early childhood education to improving high schools, making college more affordable and expanding high-quality job training.\nLifting productivity and wages also depends on creating a global race to the top in rules for trade. While some communities have suffered from foreign competition, trade has helped our economy much more than it has hurt. Exports helped lead us out of the recession. American firms that export pay their workers up to 18% more on average than companies that do not, according to a report by my Council of Economic Advisers. So, I will keep pushing for Congress to pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership and to conclude a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the EU. These agreements, and stepped-up trade enforcement, will level the playing field for workers and businesses alike.\nSecond, alongside slowing productivity, inequality has risen in most advanced economies, with that increase most pronounced in the United States. In 1979, the top 1% of American families received 7% of all after-tax income. By 2007, that share had more than doubled to 17%. This challenges the very essence of who Americans are as a people. We don't begrudge success, we aspire to it and admire those who achieve it. In fact, we've often accepted more inequality than many other nations because we are convinced that with hard work, we can improve our own station and watch our children do even better.\nAs Abraham Lincoln said, \"while we do not propose any war upon capital, we do wish to allow the humblest man an equal chance to get rich with everybody else.\" That's the problem with increased inequality—it diminishes upward mobility. It makes the top and bottom rungs of the ladder \"stickier\"—harder to move up and harder to lose your place at the top.\nEconomists have listed many causes for the rise of inequality: technology, education, globalisation, declining unions and a falling minimum wage. There is something to all of these and we've made real progress on all these fronts. But I believe that changes in culture and values have also played a major role. In the past, differences in pay between corporate executives and their workers were constrained by a greater degree of social interaction between employees at all levels—at church, at their children's schools, in civic organisations. That's why CEOs took home about 20- to 30-times as much as their average worker. The reduction or elimination of this constraining factor is one reason why today's CEO is now paid over 250-times more.\nEconomies are more successful when we close the gap between rich and poor and growth is broadly based. This is not just a moral argument. Research shows that growth is more fragile and recessions more frequent in countries with greater inequality. Concentrated wealth at the top means less of the broad-based consumer spending that drives market economies.\nAmerica has shown that progress is possible. Last year, income gains were larger for households at the bottom and middle of the income distribution than for those at the top (see chart 2). Under my administration, we will have boosted incomes for families in the bottom fifth of the income distribution by 18% by 2017, while raising the average tax rates on households projected to earn over $8m per year—the top 0.1%—by nearly 7 percentage points, based on calculations by the Department of the Treasury. While the top 1% of households now pay more of their fair share, tax changes enacted during my administration have increased the share of income received by all other families by more than the tax changes in any previous administration since at least 1960.\nEven these efforts fall well short. In the future, we need to be even more aggressive in enacting measures to reverse the decades-long rise in inequality. Unions should play a critical role. They help workers get a bigger slice of the pie but they need to be flexible enough to adapt to global competition. Raising the Federal minimum wage, expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit for workers without dependent children, limiting tax breaks for high-income households, preventing colleges from pricing out hardworking students, and ensuring men and women get equal pay for equal work would help to move us in the right direction too.\nThird, a successful economy also depends on meaningful opportunities for work for everyone who wants a job. However, America has faced a long-term decline in participation among prime-age workers (see chart 3). In 1953, just 3% of men between 25 and 54 years old were out of the labour force. Today, it is 12%. In 1999, 23% of prime-age women were out of the labour force. Today, it is 26%. People joining or rejoining the workforce in a strengthening economy have offset ageing and retiring baby-boomers since the end of 2013, stabilising the participation rate but not reversing the longer-term adverse trend.\nInvoluntary joblessness takes a toll on life satisfaction, self-esteem, physical health and mortality. It is related to a devastating rise of opioid abuse and an associated increase in overdose deaths and suicides among non-college-educated Americans—the group where labour-force participation has fallen most precipitously.\nThere are many ways to keep more Americans in the labour market when they fall on hard times. These include providing wage insurance for workers who cannot get a new job that pays as much as their old one. Increasing access to high-quality community colleges, proven job-training models and help finding new jobs would assist. So would making unemployment insurance available to more workers. Paid leave and guaranteed sick days, as well as greater access to high-quality child care and early learning, would add flexibility for employees and employers. Reforms to our criminal-justice system and improvements to re-entry into the workforce that have won bipartisan support would also improve participation, if enacted.\nBuilding a sturdier foundation\nFinally, the financial crisis painfully underscored the need for a more resilient economy, one that grows sustainably without plundering the future at the service of the present. There should no longer be any doubt that a free market only thrives when there are rules to guard against systemic failure and ensure fair competition.\nPost-crisis reforms to Wall Street have made our financial system more stable and supportive of long-term growth, including more capital for American banks, less reliance on short-term funding, and better oversight for a range of institutions and markets. Big American financial institutions no longer get the type of easier funding they got before—evidence that the market increasingly understands that they are no longer \"too big to fail\". And we created a first-of-its-kind watchdog—the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau—to hold financial institutions accountable, so their customers get loans they can repay with clear terms up-front.\nBut even with all the progress, segments of the shadow banking system still present vulnerabilities and the housing-finance system has not been reformed. That should be an argument for building on what we have already done, not undoing it. And those who should be rising in defence of further reform too often ignore the progress we have made, instead choosing to condemn the system as a whole. Americans should debate how best to build on these rules, but denying that progress leaves us more vulnerable, not less so.\nAmerica should also do more to prepare for negative shocks before they occur. With today's low interest rates, fiscal policy must play a bigger role in combating future downturns; monetary policy should not bear the full burden of stabilising our economy. Unfortunately, good economics can be overridden by bad politics. My administration secured much more fiscal expansion than many appreciated in recovering from our crisis—more than a dozen bills provided $1.4 trillion in economic support from 2009 to 2012—but fighting Congress for each commonsense measure expended substantial energy. I did not get some of the expansions I sought and Congress forced austerity on the economy prematurely by threatening a historic debt default. My successors should not have to fight for emergency measures in a time of need. Instead, support for the hardest-hit families and the economy, like unemployment insurance, should rise automatically.\nMaintaining fiscal discipline in good times to expand support for the economy when needed and to meet our long-term obligations to our citizens is vital. Curbs to entitlement growth that build on the Affordable Care Act's progress in reducing health-care costs and limiting tax breaks for the most fortunate can address long-term fiscal challenges without sacrificing investments in growth and opportunity.\nFinally, sustainable economic growth requires addressing climate change. Over the past five years, the notion of a trade-off between increasing growth and reducing emissions has been put to rest. America has cut energy-sector emissions by 6%, even as our economy has grown by 11% (see chart 4). Progress in America also helped catalyse the historic Paris climate agreement, which presents the best opportunity to save the planet for future generations.\nA hope for the future\nAmerica's political system can be frustrating. Believe me, I know. But it has been the source of more than two centuries of economic and social progress. The progress of the past eight years should also give the world some measure of hope. Despite all manner of division and discord, a second Great Depression was prevented. The financial system was stabilised without costing taxpayers a dime and the auto industry rescued. I enacted a larger and more front-loaded fiscal stimulus than even President Roosevelt's New Deal and oversaw the most comprehensive rewriting of the rules of the financial system since the 1930s, as well as reforming health care and introducing new rules cutting emissions from vehicles and power plants.\nThe results are clear: a more durable, growing economy; 15m new private-sector jobs since early 2010; rising wages, falling poverty, and the beginnings of a reversal in inequality; 20m more Americans with health insurance, while health-care costs grow at the slowest rate in 50 years; annual deficits cut by nearly three-quarters; and declining carbon emissions.\nFor all the work that remains, a new foundation is laid. A new future is ours to write. It must be one of economic growth that's not only sustainable but shared. To achieve it America must stay committed to working with all nations to build stronger and more prosperous economies for all our citizens for generations to come.", "timestamp": "2016-10-06", "title": "Essay by the President in The Economist"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122596", "text": "Today, in Montreal, Canada, 191 countries decided to adopt a global market-based measure to reduce carbon emissions from international aviation at the 39th Assembly meeting of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Today's action builds on last year's historic Paris Agreement and demonstrates continued American leadership and global momentum behind ambitious action to address climate change.\nThis global agreement addresses a growing source of global emissions that was not covered by last year's Paris Agreement. Countries agreed in Paris that the targets and policies they submitted under the Paris Agreement would not include emissions reductions from international flights. While international aviation today represents only 2 percent of global carbon emissions, the sector is forecasted to grow at around 5 percent each year beyond 2020, translating into approximately 3.3 billion tons of CO2 emissions for the period from 2020 to 2035. Without coordinated action, this growth in emissions threatens the international community's ability to meet the Paris Agreement's ambitious temperature goals and combat global climate change.\nThis new measure changes that. The world's nations have now agreed to an ambitious yet pragmatic approach to using market principles to constrain emissions from the international aviation sector. This measure results in a net peak at 2020 levels for covered international aviation emissions. Specifically, the peak will be achieved by setting a price on carbon emissions from the aviation sector, allowing airlines to either reduce their emissions or offset them through crediting, and allowing countries to begin participating in the effort in a staged approach. Over the life of the measure, up to 80 percent of international aviation emissions above the 2020 level would be offset with the possibility for increased coverage with additional participation. By 2027, nearly all countries with major international airlines will be included in this measure and will offset their emissions above 2020 levels.\nThe innovative, market-oriented nature and industry support of today's global agreement reflect a pragmatic and economically efficient approach to reducing emissions from this sector. In fact, Airlines for America, the industry trade organization for the leading U.S. airlines, last week expressed support for this global measure because it avoids a fragmented regulatory approach and offers stability and certainty to its airlines and the entire global industry.\nToday's outcome also delivers on the request in bipartisan legislation passed by Congress and signed into law by President Obama in 2012 for the Administration to conduct international negotiations to pursue a worldwide approach to address aircraft emissions.\nKey Elements of the Global Market-Based Measure\n•      Reducing or Offsetting international aviation emissions: Starting in 2021, airlines covered by the measure will purchase emissions offset credits to account for their growth in emissions above 2020 levels.\n•      Participation: The measure is designed to encourage the broadest participation possible, while providing flexibility by giving countries the option to participate from the beginning in 2021, or waiting until 2024 or 2027 for countries that have limited capacity or that need technical assistance to participate. Already, a diverse range of over 65 countries representing over 85 percent of global air traffic have decided to participate starting in 2021 – reinforcing the wide agreement that combatting climate change requires universal action from all countries.\n•      Review: The measure will be thoroughly reviewed every three years to consider improvements based on experience implementing the measure.\n•      Incentive for action: By putting a price on carbon emissions from aviation, this market-based measure will provide an incentive to further technology improvements, air traffic efficiency improvements, and the development and use of sustainable alternative fuels.\nThe decision to adopt a global market-based measure provides for the world's airlines to purchase carbon offset credits for any international growth in carbon emissions above 2020 levels. This builds on efforts being undertaken by ICAO and in the United States to reduce emissions from aviation, including the development of new technologies, such as experimental aircraft intended to dramatically reduce fuel use, emissions, and noise [hyperlink to NASA], more efficient air traffic operations, and the development of sustainable alternative fuels. The measure complements the adoption earlier this year of international CO2 standards for aircraft developed at ICAO, which set a technology standard for new and in production aircraft.", "timestamp": "2016-10-06", "title": "Fact Sheet: 191 Countries Reach a Global Climate Deal for International Aviation"}

The unprecedented combination of open data and technological talent that has emerged in recent years can play a critical role in closing that gap, as technologists partner with community leaders to expand access to opportunity in ways that were not previously possible.\nThe President launched the  Opportunity Project in March 2016 to catalyze the creation of new digital tools that use federal and local data to empower communities with information about critical resources, such as affordable housing, quality schools, and jobs. By providing easy access to curated federal and local datasets at  opportunity.census.gov, and facilitating collaboration between technologists, issue experts, and community leaders, the Opportunity Project is transforming government data into digital tools that create more just and equitable communities and help people solve problems in their everyday lives.\nSince its inception, the Opportunity Project has yielded dozens of new digital tools that help meet needs in communities like finding affordable housing near jobs and transportation, advocating for broader access to opportunity in neighborhoods, and making data-driven investments to increase economic mobility.\nThrough the Opportunity Project, technologists, local governments, and community groups across the country are answering the President's call to harness 21st century technology and innovation to expand access to opportunity for all Americans.\nKey components of today's announcements include:\n* Twenty-nine new digital tools built by non-profits, companies, and students, use federal and local data to address a set of national priorities identified by six federal agencies, specifically the Departments of Labor, Transportation, Education, Housing and Urban Development, and Agriculture, and the Office of the Surgeon General with support from the Department of Veterans Affairs. Organizations including Great Schools, MapBox, Airbnb, the University of Oregon, and FitBit collaborated with community members to accelerate progress toward these priorities. They created digital tools that help unemployed Americans build skills and find jobs, increase transit accessibility in low-income communities, help families navigate information on the quality of schools, and tackle other pressing challenges.\n* The Department of Commerce announces its commitment to lead the Opportunity Project moving forward and create a lasting platform for technologists to collaborate with government and local communities using federal open data.\n* New and easier ways to access high-value Federal data on civil rights and course access through the Department of Education's new Civil Rights Data Collection Application Program Interfaces (APIs), and combined jobs, skills, training and wage data through the Department of Labor's new OpenSkills API.\n* New commitments from federal government, non-profits, tech companies, coding boot camps, and academic institutions to use the Opportunity Project data and create or use digital tools to build stronger ladders of opportunity nationwide, such as the Department of Labor and Department of Education's commitment to co-lead a new Opportunity Project challenge, new funding from Coursera for universities to develop courses that use the Opportunity Project data in their curriculum, and more.\n* A call to action from the White House for members of the public to develop new tools, offer additional sources of data, and invent new ways of using open data to make our communities more prosperous, equitable, and just.  We want to hear what new steps you are taking or programs you are implementing in your community.\nMore Details on Today's Announcements\nAdministration actions to expand the Opportunity Project\n•      The Department of Commerce will lead the Opportunity Project and create a lasting platform for technologists to collaborate with government and local communities using federal open data.

As we mark 5 years since the first Manufacturing Day, we must inspire the next generation of workers and innovators to seek careers in manufacturing. Let us continue working to strengthen and expand the manufacturing jobs of tomorrow and ensure that opportunity for all is something we can keep making in America for generations to come.\" - President Obama, October 6, 2016\nU.S. manufacturing is making a comeback, with more than 800,000 new jobs added since the sector turned the corner after the Great Recession in 2010. For the last four years in a row, global CEOs have named the United States the best place to make and invest, and new capital investment is flowing in to a broad range of manufacturing technologies.\nTomorrow, on the fifth-annual Manufacturing Day, we mark an Administration-long focus on the technologies and skills that are the foundation of the most dynamic manufacturing sector in the world. The President is proclaiming October 7 as  National Manufacturing Day to celebrate Made in America and renew his commitment to this vibrant sector.\nThe Administration is announcing important progress in support of American manufacturing, including:\n•      Announcements by 5 Federal Agencies, including grants to strengthen manufacturing supply chains by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, challenges to catalyze next-generation technologies by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and initiatives to support more American Veterans pursuing technical training in advanced manufacturing by the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n•      Commitments by more than 110 organizations, including the first manufacturing-oriented massive open online course of its kind by MIT, 18 expanded and inaugural  Grand Challenge Scholars Programs by colleges and universities across the country, and 30 new manufacturing apprenticeships by the Manufacturing Association of Central New York.\n•      A new report by the National Economic Council, highlighting an Administration-long focus to strengthen the competitiveness of American manufacturing.\nBackground\nToo often, young people do not envision themselves in the manufacturing careers that proudly produce iconic Made in USA goods, like world-class aircraft engines, life-saving biopharmaceuticals, and cutting-edge automobiles. That's why President Obama has proclaimed October 7, 2016 as National Manufacturing Day to celebrate the strength of American manufacturing and to motivate the next generation of manufacturers.\nIn support of Manufacturing Day, thousands of U.S. manufacturers are expected to host factory tours, hackathons, and career exploration panels, providing hands-on demonstrations of what 21st Century manufacturing looks like In addition to the more than 500,000 students and local organizations expected to participate, Administration officials will be celebrating the 5th annual Manufacturing Day, including:\n•      In Portland, OR, Department of Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker is moderating a panel of recent graduates with careers in manufacturing and touring demonstrations of 3D printers and robots at the Center for Advanced Learning. Secretary Pritzker is also joining local high school students for a facilities tour at Lam Research, an equipment manufacturer for advanced semiconductors.\n•      In Warren, MI, Department of Education Secretary John B. King, Jr. saw first-hand how production molds are designed and manufactured for the plastics industry at Proper Tooling, followed by a roundtable with students, employees of Macomb Community College, and employees of Proper Tooling to discuss the foundational role of STEM education in advanced manufacturing.\n•      In Wilmington, DE, Department of Labor Secretary Thomas Perez participated in roundtables at RC Fabricators, a steel manufacturer, and Zip Code Wilmington, a nonprofit coding school, focused on the crucial role that apprenticeships play in equipping works with the skills they need to compete in today's labor market.\n•      In National Harbor, MD, U.S. Chief Technology Officer Megan Smith is co-creating the vehicles of tomorrow with students from the Arlington Career Center, Georgetown University, the George Washington University, Oxon Hill Middle School, Thurgood Marshall College Fund, the University of the District of Columbia, and the University of Maryland at the Local Motors demonstration facility.\nAn Administration-Long Focus on American Manufacturing\nEntering office in 2009 in the midst of grim economic and financial conditions in the United States and around the world, President Obama took immediate steps to restore balance to the U.S. economy. The Administration recognized that economic stability is rooted in a strong manufacturing sector, and so prioritized manufacturing as a cornerstone of the economic policy agenda. In the fall of 2009, the Administration released the  Framework for Revitalizing American Manufacturing, a policy blueprint to revitalize the manufacturing sector.\nOver the last 8 years, the Administration has made substantial progress in four core areas: spurring innovation through next-generation technologies; making the U.S. more cost-competitive for production; strengthening skills, communities, and supply chains to attract investment; and capturing our fair share by leveling the playing field, opening access to markets, and promoting U.S. investment.\nFour years ago, in response to a  recommendation by the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, the Administration created a National Network for Manufacturing Innovation, connecting people, ideas, and technology to solve industry-relevant advanced manufacturing challenges. Now known as Manufacturing USA, the program has grown to nine connected institutes with nearly 1,300 member companies, universities, and non-profits. The Federal government's commitment of over $600 million to the nine awarded institutes has been matched by over $1.3 billion in non-Federal resources from across industry, academia, and state government. More institutes, representing more than $800 million in additional Federal and non-Federal resources, are on the way and will keep the Administration on track to meet the President's goal of launching 15 Manufacturing USA institutes before the end of the Administration.\nNew Steps Being Announced by the Administration Today\nFederal announcements in support of Manufacturing Day being made today are:\n•      The National Economic Council is releasing a  new report on the state of the manufacturing sector, including new findings that illustrate the rise in advanced technology skills among manufacturing workers and the increasingly technology-driven nature of this sector, and highlights the Administration's efforts over the last 8 years to strengthen the competitiveness of American manufacturing. The report finds that a strong manufacturing sector is vital to a growing innovative economy, and notes:\no      Workers employed in manufacturing earn 20 percent higher than the median income and, even when holding all other factors equal, it is clear that workers in the manufacturing sector earn a pay premium.\no      The manufacturing sector houses a great deal of innovative activity, with 75 percent of private sector research and development, 60 percent of all U.S. R&D employees, and the vast majority of patents issued, despite representing only 12 percent of the GDP.\no      Manufacturing activity generates positive spillover benefits, because the know-how and capabilities gained in making things is a key ingredient in continued leadership in design, product development, and innovation.\no      Since the Great Recession, manufacturing has grown at nearly twice the pace of the economy overall, marking the longest period where manufacturing has outpaced U.S. economic output in 50 years.\no      Analysis by the President's Council of Economic Advisers suggests that cyclical factors do not fully explain manufacturing's job gains, as the job gains between 2010 and early 2014 are about 500,000 above and beyond what would be associated with the historical cyclical pattern.\n•      The interagency Advanced Manufacturing National Program Office is building on the Secretary of Commerce's announcement of Manufacturing USA, the new public name for the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation, by launching ManufacturingUSA.com. This new website will be the central portal for learning about upcoming events, technology innovations, and industry news coming from the Manufacturing USA institutes.\n•      The Department of Energy has recently announced a notice of intent to invest over $30 million in hydrogen and fuel cell projects that will leverage national lab consortia launched under the Energy Department's Energy Materials Network (EMN). The EMN consortia make unique, world-class capabilities at the national laboratories more accessible to industry and academia, facilitating collaborations that will expedite the development of advanced materials, in support of the President's advanced manufacturing and Materials Genome initiatives.\n•      The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), in collaboration with Bradley University, together with sponsors Caterpillar, Bechtel, and Brick & Mortar Ventures, is announcing two new phases of its  3D-Printed Habitat Challenge, representing new funding of $2.5 million. Phase 2 will launch immediately to advance materials composition fundamental to manufacturing extraterrestrial habitats using mission recycled materials and/or local indigenous materials. Phase 3 will open the summer of 2017, targeting the autonomous manufacturing of the habitats using 3D Printed technology.\n•      The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP), building on five pilot awards  announced in September 2016, plans to launch a Federal Funding Opportunity of approximately $4 million to embed personnel from MEP centers at up to 4 more Manufacturing USA institutes by the end of the year. The awards will cultivate enduring collaborations among small U.S. manufacturers, the institutes, and MEP centers to develop strong innovation ecosystems across the manufacturing supply chain.\n•      The National Science Foundation (NSF) is announcing a new call for research proposals to address critical fundamental research needs in advanced manufacturing, especially proposals that will enable innovations in one or more of the Manufacturing USA institutes' focus areas and leverage the facilities, infrastructure and member companies of an institute. NSF is also announcing a new call for research proposals on the advanced biomanufacturing of therapeutic cells to enable the manufacturing of reproducible, cost-effective and high-potency cells with predictable biological efficacy. NSF anticipates funding up to 10 awards in advanced biomanufacturing of therapeutic cells, totaling $5 million.\n•      The Department of Veterans Affairs Center for Innovation is collaborating with America Makes and 3D Veterans to expand the  3D Veterans Bootcamp, a program that provides Veterans with technical training in 3D printing and design skills to accelerate designs to market. The training will prepare over 400 Veterans and transitioning service members per year for careers in advanced manufacturing and provide guidance and resources for those wishing to launch their own business. With a successful pilot program in San Antonio, 3D Veterans is announcing new boot camps in Los Angeles, CA; Carson, CA; San Francisco, CA; Philadelphia, PA; and El Paso, TX.\nAdditional Actions in Response to the Administration's Call to Action\nToday's actions focus on inspiring and preparing the next generation of manufacturers and STEM practitioners, as well as supporting entrepreneurs manufacturing their first product in the United States.\nEducating and Training the Next Generation of Manufacturers\nManufacturing USA prepares America's workers for jobs in manufacturing, where each institute acts as a \"teaching factory\" to provide unique opportunities for training students and workers at all levels. Institutes also provide assets to help small manufacturers and other member companies access cutting-edge capabilities and equipment needed to design, test, and pilot new products and manufacturing processes. Today, many of the Manufacturing USA institutes are announcing new education and workforce training initiatives:\n•      America Makes, with the Lanterman Group, is launching a new training initiative, Advanced Curriculum in Additive Manufacturing, Engineering and Design Innovation (ACADEMI)—an immersive, hands-on training environment, integrating skills from a variety of disciplines into a Design for Additive Manufacturing Bootcamp; available to America Makes' members at its Innovation Factory in Youngstown, OH, in the spring of 2017.\n•      The Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation Institute (DMDII) is announcing new strategic alliances with the National Coalition of Advanced Technical Centers (NCATC) and the American Indian Higher Education Consortium to rapidly connect institute technologies and workforce development resources with training providers, enhancing community college curriculum for digital transformations in manufacturing. DMDII, with NIST MEP, is immediately expanding its Train the Trainer program by 50 percent to include an additional five centers, educating manufacturing practitioners on digital manufacturing and enabling MEP Centers to assist small- and medium-sized manufacturers in adopting this next-generation technology.\n•      The Institute for Advanced Composites Manufacturing Innovation (IACMI) is announcing a series of four hands-on training workshops, to be held in 2017, aimed at accelerating the adoption of cutting-edge, energy-efficient technologies within the composites ecosystem. The first workshop in May 2017 will demonstrate the latest advanced manufacturing techniques with state-of-the-art equipment and experts to answer questions in real time. IACMI expects 200 manufacturers from more than 20 states to attend.\n•      IACMI and Lightweight Innovations for Tomorrow (LIFT) will jointly develop and launch a lightweighting \"learning hub\" and information portal by the end of this year. The open source portal will provide content and courses, lab activities, and curricula to help educators at all levels infuse information on lightweight materials, technologies, and processes into educational pathways to jobs in the industry.\n•      LIFT, in a new collaboration with IACMI, will roll-out MakerMinded in 150 middle and high schools across Kentucky and Tennessee this school year. MakerMinded, a state-wide school outreach program, aims to create the next generation of manufacturing leaders by infusing today's learning infrastructure with a manufacturing mindset and connecting engaging educational activities and programs with students through a digital platform.

Welcome to the White House! And we are here to celebrate an extraordinary achievement: Phil Kessel is a Stanley Cup Champion! [Laughter] Hey!\nWe've got some special guests in the house, some big fans who are Members of Congress. We've got NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman. Gary, I have to say, I respect Lord Stanley, but I'm going to need you to explain to me how something called the President's Trophy is the not highest award a team can win. [Laughter]\nBut we're actually making some history here today. I am proud to be the first President to welcome to the White House eight Cup-winning teams, all of whom are based in the United States. I reminded the Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau—who we had a state dinner here—about that not too long ago. And that, of course, includes this year's outstanding champions. Let's give it up for the Pittsburgh Penguins.\nSo this is a nice bookend to my Presidency because the first year, you guys won the Cup. Now you're coming back for my final year. A lot has changed during the interim. Back in 2009, my hair matched the color of the puck more than the ice. [Laughter] \"Sid the Kid\" was actually a kid. [Laughter] And Geno was still snapping pictures with a flip phone. [Laughter]\nBut what I like best about this team's victory is that no one thought they could pull it off. I obviously sympathize with that; they said the same thing about me. [Laughter] Mike Sullivan started the season coaching the minor league team in Wilkes-Barre and Scranton. That's Biden country and Casey country. In late December, the Pens were closer to last place than first. Spirits were low. And when the team designed its 50th anniversary logo for the upcoming season, it referenced the franchise's three Cups because no one imagined they were about to win a fourth.\nAnd then, \"GM of the Year\" Jim Rutherford got to work. He was smart enough to see that Sullivan had coached in the Blackhawks organization, so he knew—[laughter]—he knew Sullivan brought a lot to the table. Goalie Matt Murray, a rookie, was a brick wall. The H-B-K line—none of whom were on the team last year—were so dominant that they earned their own sandwich at Primanti Brothers. [Laughter] The Pens went 14-2 down the stretch to finish second in the East.\n[At this point, a baby cried.]\nAnd then—don't worry, I don't have any more bad jokes. That poor thing. [Laughter] It's like, aww, these are so corny. [Laughter] Yes, I know. [Laughter]\nAnd then, they powered through three rounds, each tougher than the last, before taking care of the Sharks in six games, one of the most remarkable turnarounds in the history of the NHL.\nOf course, leading the way was my fellow lefty, Sidney Crosby. Last time he was here, I took a cheap shot at Sid for his size. [Laughter] I wasn't the first one on or off the ice. Of course, since then, he's won two Olympic Golds, a World Championship, a World Cup MVP, a Playoff MVP, another NHL MVP, a mountain of other postseason awards, even won an Emmy. And of course, he hoisted this trophy right here, his second Stanley Cup, to match his mentor, Super Mario. So, Sid, what an extraordinary accomplishment.\nAnd obviously, nobody has to tell you his extraordinary achievements on the ice, but here's something worth mentioning. During the playoffs, defenseman Trevor Daley's mom was battling cancer. She told him that she was going to keep fighting so she'd see her son lift the Cup. Now, the captain always chooses who gets it second. It's a big honor. Sid surprised everybody, including Trevor, by handing it to him. Trevor's mom Trudy got to see her son skate around with it—on a broken ankle—and then passed away a few days later. And that's a testament to the kind of person Sid is, but also the kind of team this is.\nAll summer, these players shared the Cup with their families. Nick Bonino brought it to his grandparents' place, where they ate his Nana's famous tuna fish pasta out of it. [Laughter] He let his infant daughter Maisie sit in it. A Cup celebration spanning four generations—to paraphrase the legendary \"Badger Bob\" Johnson—that's \"a great day for hockey.\"\nAnd of course, the people of Pittsburgh love their Penguins, including their outstanding mayor. Bill, where are you? Is he—I heard he's here. Here he is! Bill Peduto. Four hundred thousand people welcomed them home from San Jose, the largest crowd for a sports parade in the city's history, which is saying something for the City of Champions.\nPittsburgh also appreciates this team, as do I, for what they've done in the community. A bunch of the players brought the Cup to Children's Hospital—in fact, it was Ian Cole's very first stop. Inspired by Michelle's \"Let's Move!\" initiative, the Penguins Foundation started Project PowerPlay to get more kids exercising, and now it's helping to restore city and county parks across Pittsburgh. The Foundation is also raising awareness about concussions for young athletes. And the Pens have been leaders in the Green Sports Alliance, making their facilities more energy- and water-efficient, lowering their carbon footprint as they travel. I want to thank Commissioner Bettman and the entire NHL for leading the way in environmentally sustainable sports, because we want to continue to have ice so that we can play hockey. [Laughter]\nYou guys are champions because of your persistence, because of your teamwork, the faith you have in each other. You've set a great example for the city and for the league. Keep up the great work on and off the ice. Have a great season.\nAnd once again, let's hear it for the World Champion—or at least the NHL Champion, and we're going to call them the World Champion—Pittsburgh Penguins! [Applause] Hey!\nThank you. Sid, did you want to say anything?\nCenter Sidney Crosby. No, that's okay. [Inaudible]\n[At this point, the President was presented a miniature trophy and team jersey.]\nThe President. All right. That's a good—that's good looking. [Laughter] That's not bad. All right, let's strike the podium so that we can get a good picture of everybody. Come on.", "timestamp": "2016-10-06", "title": "Remarks Honoring the 2016 Stanley Cup Champion Pittsburgh Penguins"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "This proclamation was published in the  Federal Register  on October 12.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119079", "text": "By the President of the United States of America\nA Proclamation\nSince our earliest days, innovation has been one of the most important driving forces of the American economy, and for generations, our manufacturing industry was the ticket to a good middle-class life. Over time, developing technology has changed the way we approach manufacturing. American manufacturing lost roughly one-third of its jobs in the first decade of the new century—during the global recession—and the middle class paid the price. Despite that, in recent years, through the determination of our resilient workforce, our economy and our manufacturing industry have been on the rise. Since 2010, we have added more than 800,000 manufacturing jobs and witnessed the fastest pace of manufacturing job growth since the 1990s—and today, factories are opening doors more quickly than at any time in the past 20 years. On National Manufacturing Day, we celebrate American manufacturing and recognize our potential to remain competitive by continuing to strengthen research, development, and our manufacturing sector.\nTo build on this progress, we must keep America on the cutting edge of innovation and attract more high-quality manufacturing jobs for workers to fill in the 21st-century economy. We have worked to grow the jobs of tomorrow through Manufacturing USA, a national network of manufacturing hubs that bring businesses, research universities, and governments together to co-invest in the development of world-leading manufacturing technologies and capabilities. These manufacturing hubs not only enable some of the best minds in America to work together, but they also create a home for specific technology focus areas in manufacturing that attract people from around the world. Government can and should play a role in catalyzing this progress, which is why my Administration has already announced nine manufacturing hubs, with even more planned in the future. By supporting this network of global leadership in manufacturing, we are ensuring a steady stream of good jobs and pursuing the potential to fundamentally change the way we build things in America. I encourage everyone to visit www.Manufacturing.gov to learn more about the ways we have highlighted these partnerships to increase our competitiveness and advance our national manufacturing infrastructure.\nThe growing maker movement has played a role in encouraging manufacturing. Through our Nation of Makers initiative, we have worked to give students, entrepreneurs, and all Americans access to new technologies so they can design and build anything they can dream of. The democratization of tools required to create products has been critical for supporting entrepreneurship and has led to a renaissance of American manufacturing—and we must continue to foster the culture of making and entrepreneurship. Our economic competitiveness in domestic manufacturing depends on critical investments in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education. If we make the necessary investments to help students and young people experience hands-on STEM learning, we can spark a deep interest and help them develop the passion and creativity they need to excel in the 21st-century economy.\nEach year, hundreds of thousands of people observe this day by attending open houses, public tours, and career workshops. As we mark 5 years since the first National Manufacturing Day, we must inspire the next generation of workers and innovators to seek careers in manufacturing. Let us continue working to strengthen and expand the manufacturing jobs of tomorrow and ensure that opportunity for all is something we can keep making in America for generations to come.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 7, 2016, as National Manufacturing Day. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with programs and activities that highlight the contributions of American manufacturers, and I encourage all Americans to visit a manufacturer in their local community.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-10-06", "title": "Proclamation 9516—National Manufacturing Day, 2016"}

Even after he was reportedly briefed on the very findings that were just announced publicly by U.S. government officials, he stood on a debate stage one week ago and played dumb about Russia's role in this hack. He has repeatedly praised Vladimir Putin, outlined a list of pro-Putin policies, and has done hundreds of millions of dollars of business with Russian interests. Even his own running mate has criticized Putin yet Trump continues to refuse. It should concern every American that Russia is willing to engage in such hostile acts in order to help Donald Trump become President of the United States. But even worse, Trump's own actions suggests he welcomes the help.

As you saw this morning, the President was briefed by FEMA Administrator Fugate, his Deputy Homeland Security Director, Amy Pope, and Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson. You heard directly from the President, so I don't have much to add to his comments other than to underscore what he said at the end, which is he'll remain engaged and focused on this, just as he has over the past week, through the upcoming weekend.\nQ: One thing that wasn't addressed on Matthew I wanted to bring up. Governor Scott -- there were several requests of Governor Scott to extend the voter registration deadline. He declined to do that. Does the President believe that Governor Scott should reconsider and extend the voting registration deadline in Florida in light of the storm?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Mike, I saw some of the exchanges on that. I don't know if we've weighed in on that specific decision. I can tell you, generally speaking, the President believes we should be making it easier for people to vote, not harder. And any steps that impede on a citizen's ability to exercise that right to vote is a step in the wrong direction.\nSo right now, we're focused on the storm and recovery and response. But again, generally speaking, the President believes we should be doing everything possible to make it easier for people to exercise their constitutional right to vote.\nQ: Do you expect him to go down there this week?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I don't have any additional travel for the President to announce. As you know, John, we were scheduled to go down there last week, but the President made the decision to postpone that trip because what he didn't want to do was deter assets that were going to be positioned in preparing for response -- for storm response. He didn't want to deter those assets to prepare for his own travel. So he pulled down that trip. We said we would postpone it. We haven't announced a new date. But instead of traveling to Florida, he went to FEMA Headquarters to get a briefing on the storm and to make sure that the response was going to be of high caliber from the federal government.\nQ: Do you know why the President went back to the Oval Office last minute? Did he forget something? Or what was it?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Yes, he forgot something that he wanted to bring on the trip. He's human like the rest of us.\nQ: Donald Trump said earlier today that people are pouring over the border to affect our election by voting -- illegal immigrants are coming over from, I guess, Mexico to vote. Do you have any reaction?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I haven't seen those comments and I have no idea what he would use to back those up.\nQ: Do you have any comments on the Wall Street Journal story about the emails from the White House to the State Department?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I saw that story, John, and all I know is that for years now, my boss, Josh Earnest, from the podium in the White House Briefing Room has acknowledged that our staff in the communications office at the White House will be in touch with Secretary Clinton's team about stories that pertain to Secretary Clinton's service to the Obama administration. So the documents that were printed seemed to only back up what Josh has been acknowledging for a while now.\nQ: But there was some indication that the State Department was pressuring CBS, for instance, not to ask John Kerry about the email situation and that they seemed like they succeeded. They claimed to have succeeded. Is that an appropriate sort of position for the administration to be in?\nMR. SCHULTZ: That's not my understanding. You'll have to talk to the State Department about any engagements they had with media outlets.\nQ: A senior military official in Russia said that the country is considering reestablishing its presence in Cuba and Vietnam, and going back to some of the bases from the Cold War era. Do you have any reaction to that?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Toluse, I haven't seen those comments. Obviously, our relationship with Russia right now is one that remains complicated. Obviously, there are areas where we disagree, and there's areas where we've still been able to put those disagreements aside and work together. Generally speaking, we believe that we can work together when we have joint goals. And unfortunately, in recent times, Russia has not been able to live up to the commitments that they've made -- whether that's in Syria, whether that's in Ukraine, or elsewhere around the world.\nSo we've been disappointed and concerned by Russia not living up to their word, but that something they're going to have to answer for.\nQ: The President again raised concerns about Haiti, which was hit very hard by Hurricane Matthew. Does the administration have any plans for aid to Haiti, or are you guys looking at anything to help them?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Ayesha, thank you for raising that. I can tell you that while we are laser-focused on the response to the storm within the United States, the damage caused by the storm in the Caribbean has been devastating. And our thoughts and prayers are particularly with the families and loved ones of those who died in this tragic storm.\nUSAID has already sent disaster teams to Haiti, Jamaica and the Bahamas, and they're working with local authorities to coordinate relief efforts. USAID has already provided an initial $1.5 million in assistance. And the Department of Defense has authorized up to $11 million in overseas humanitarian disaster and civic aid.\nI can also tell you that Department of Defense personnel are on the ground in Haiti. Currently, there's about 150 people there. I suspect that, weather permitting, that number will grow to a couple hundred over the weekend. And those men and women on the ground are helping with disaster response. They're fulfilling responsibilities that would normally fall to -- in the case of the United States -- the National Guard. So that's distributing food and water; that's making sure that assets are able to move; that's helping with transportation; that's able to stand up sort of first responder and emergency response apparatus.\nSo Haiti doesn't have that infrastructure, unfortunately, as the President said. They're one of the poorest nations of the world, so that's why the President wanted to make sure that the Department of Defense was able to help send personnel to the ground to help out with that.\nQ: The President mentioned that he's going to I guess fill out his ballot but not go to a precinct. Is there a reason why he's not voting in person this time? Can you talk about that?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Ayesha, I don't have any scheduling announcements to tell you about. As you know, the President takes his responsibility as citizen very seriously. He likes to lead by example on this. And so he's called voting one of the most important responsibilities every citizen has. So I do know that Illinois is a state that enjoys early vote. That's an option that the President has availed himself of previously, and so if he decides to that on this trip, we'll make sure you guys tag along.\nQ: Eric, keeping on this trip, he hasn't gone out and really -- I mean, he's done a lot of campaign work for Hillary Clinton, but not too many for individual Senate and House candidates. What are some of the factors behind why he wanted to do something for Tammy Duckworth? Why is this particular race so important to him?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Thanks, Kevin. It's a good question. As you point out, we have done some events for individual candidates beyond Secretary Clinton. The President -- I was at an event where -- for Governor Inslee of Washington State, Senator Murray of Washington.\nBut you're right -- Congresswoman Duckworth is a friend of the President. They've worked together in a number of capacities. But that's not the main reason why he'll be doing an event for her on Sunday. The main reason is he thinks she's a phenomenal public servant. She's a true patriot. She's someone who puts country first. She's served in a variety of capacities. She served her country in a variety of capacities -- obviously in Iraq; she headed the veterans office in the state of Illinois; she served in this administration. She proudly was in a senior leadership role at the Veterans Administration and, obviously, she now serves in the House of Representatives. The President wants to make sure that the people of Illinois give her a promotion of the United States Senate.\nI think what you're probably getting at in your question is this isn't just another seat in Congress for the President -- this is his own Senate seat. So this is one that's important to him, and I think you'll hear more about that on Sunday.\nQ: Eric, just to follow up on that, has there been a sense from the President that maybe he doesn't want to get too involved in a race like this just to avoid the perception of this race as closer than it is?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Mike, you probably follow the polls closer on this than I do, but the President's view is, we take nothing for granted. And he's, as you all have observed, been working hard this year to make sure that Democrats wage successful campaigns in the fall. He feels like the stakes are enormously high. He wants to make sure that Democrats up and down the ballot have the resources they need to wage effective campaigns. We're getting to that \"Get Out the Vote\" time of the campaigns, especially in a state like Illinois, with early vote. So you'll hear more about this from the President. He does have deep views about this particular campaign, and I think he'll in a position to share them with you on Sunday.\nQ: Does he feel this is unfinished business, having a Republican in the seat that he once occupied?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, like I said, he thinks Congresswoman Duckworth is a phenomenal public servant, someone who has bravely served this country in a number of capacities, and he wants to see her in the Senate.\nQ: Is the President planning to see Mayor Rahm Emmanuel? And how would you describe their relationship? He's been here a few times -- I don't know when the last time they actually have seen each other is.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Toluse, I can try and pull that for you. I know one of the last Chicago trips I did they had a chance to connect. I'm not sure if they'll have a chance to see each other on this trip, but I can check for you.\nQ: Does the President think that Mayor Emanuel is doing a good job in Chicago, given the fact that Republicans always talk about Chicago as being a sign of bad Democratic leadership, specifically for the African American community?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Thank you for reminding me to answer your broader question. Yes, the President and Mayor Emanuel are good friends. Their relationship goes back many years. The President is proud of Rahm Emanuel's service as chief of staff for the first few years of this presidency. They do remain in touch. Like I said, occasionally when the President gets to travel to Chicago, they're able to connect. I will let you know if they meet up in person.\nObviously, the President loves the city of Chicago and making sure that Chicago does well is important to him. And he thinks nobody knows the challenges and opportunities that Chicago faces better than Mayor Emanuel and nobody is working harder on those on any given day. So he appreciates the work that Mayor Emanuel does. And anyone who knows Mayor Emanuel knows that work probably continues around the clock.\nQ: Will the President be undertaking any business this weekend related to his library?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Kevin, again, I don't have any scheduling announcements for you. What I will say is that, consistent with our obligations to the press, if the President makes any movements or has any events that are outside of where he's staying, we'll let you know.\nThank you, guys.\nEND 12:36 P.M.

His faith in the prospect of a better future for the people of Colombia has never wavered. And, although the work is not yet done, thanks to his leadership, after 52 years of violence, it's possible to envision a hemisphere that is fully at peace.\nAs the Nobel Committee so appropriately recognized, this award does not honor just one man, it also honors an entire nation, striving for a brighter tomorrow. Over the past two decades, the Colombian people have worked with courage and unflagging determination to reclaim their country from violence and to pull themselves back from the brink of economic collapse.\nAlthough the Colombian people did not vote to ratify the negotiated peace agreement, they have not turned their back on the idea of peace. And Colombia now has an opportunity to strengthen the peace accord through a national dialogue, which President Santos has called to determine the next steps in the path to peace.\nI encourage all the people of Colombia to continue to pursue that vision. Keep the faith. The work of peace is never finished, but the progress the Colombian people have already made is a powerful testament to the fact that peace is possible.\nTogether with the international community, the United States will continue to help the Colombian people on their journey to peace.

Nikki Randhawa Haley of South Carolina; Gov. Patrick L. McCrory of North Carolina; and Gov. Richard L. Scott of Florida.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119080", "text": "The President. Obviously, everybody has been tracking the course of Hurricane Matthew, and I just received an update from our FEMA director, Craig Fugate, as well as the rest of our national security team. And I just wanted to make a couple of key points.\nFirst, what we're seeing now is Matthew having moved above South Florida and some of the largest population centers, working its way north. And the big concern that people are having right now is the effects that it could have in areas like Jacksonville on through Georgia. And although we've seen some significant damage in portions of South Florida, I think the bigger concern at this point is not just hurricane-force winds, but storm surge.\nMany of you will remember Hurricane Sandy, where initially people thought this doesn't look as bad as we thought, and then suddenly you get massive storm surge and a lot of people were severely affected. And so I just want to emphasize to everybody that this is still a really dangerous hurricane; that the potential for storm surge, flooding, loss of life, and severe property damage continues to exist. And people continue to need to follow the instructions of their local officials over the course of the next 24, 48, 72 hours.\nThose of you who live in Georgia, I think, should be paying attention because there's been a lot of emphasis on Florida, but this thing is going to keep on moving north, through Florida, into South Carolina. There are large population centers there that could be vulnerable, so pay attention to what your local officials are telling you. If they tell you to evacuate, you need to get out of there and move to higher ground, because storm surge can move very quickly, and people can think that they're out of the woods and then suddenly get hit and not be in a position in which they and their families are safe. So pay attention to local officials.\nIn the meantime, I've been in contact with the Governors of all four of the potentially affected States. I want to thank them all for their leadership. There's been strong cooperation between Federal and State and local officials. FEMA has worked diligently to pre-position resources, assets, water, food, commodities. And as the hurricane moves north, what Craig and his team will be doing is moving those resources and assets further north so that any place that happens to get hit badly, we'll be in a position to immediately come in and help.\nBut I really want to emphasize the Governors have been on top of this. State and local officials have been on top of this. They are the ones who are tracking most closely what is happening in your particular community, your particular area. You need to pay attention to them. Do what they say. Do not be a holdout here because we can always replace property, but we can't replace lives.\nI want to thank Craig and his whole team as well as Department of Homeland Security, my own national security team for really staying on top of this. We're going to monitor this throughout the weekend. Our thoughts and prayers are with folks who have been affected. It's—even if the damage in South Florida wasn't as bad as it could be, there are people who've been affected, and for them, they're going to need help.\nLast point I'd like to make is, we're still tracking what happened in areas like Haiti that were hit more directly. Haiti is one of the poorest countries in the world. It has consistently been hit and battered by a lot of natural disasters to compound what is already great poverty there. We know that hundreds of people have lost their lives and that there's been severe property damage and they're going to need help rebuilding. So I would ask all Americans to go to the American Red Cross and other philanthropic agencies to make sure that we're doing what we need to do to help people in need. And we'll continue to provide information. If you're interested in how you can help the people of Haiti and others, you can go to whitehouse.gov and we'll provide you some direction in terms of where. Even the smallest contribution can really make a big difference.\nAll right? Thank you very much, everybody.\nFederal Emergency Management Agency Funding\nQ. Sir, does FEMA—does FEMA have enough funding?\nThe President. FEMA is in a good position right now. We had some concerns last year when we were in the midst of budget negotiations. I think that we did a good job of making sure that FEMA was properly funded and, not to make him blush, but we happen to have one of the best public servants in America in Craig Fugate and his team, and they know how to manage their money and use it effectively.\nSo that's not going to be an issue. Of course, we always want to be cautious about making assessments with respect to damage. We're still on the front end of this hurricane. We're not on the back end. So we don't know how bad the damage could end up. We don't know how severe the storm surge could end up being. And we're not going to know for 3, 4, 5 days what the ultimate effects of this are.\nIf we end up having really significant problems and really severe property damage, then the Stafford Act comes into play, our ability to provide through emergency declarations and other mechanisms—more help to local governments—that's always going to be a question. We have, as you know, we still have flooding in Louisiana that has left a lot of people homeless. Over 100,000 people lost their homes there and we still have to rebuild. There are—is a backlog of need from natural disasters around the country that we'd like, hopefully during the lame duck session, to figure out how to fund effectively.\nSo the issue is not so much FEMA's funding for immediate emergency response; the issue is going to be making sure that after the, in this case the hurricane, but in other cases flooding or wildfires or other natural disasters—after they've happened, are we in a position to properly help people rebuild? And we'll obviously make those assessments after the fact and then we'll talk to Congress about how we can help out.\nAll right? Thank you, everybody.\n2016 Presidential and Congressional Elections\nQ. Are you going to vote while you're in Chicago?\nThe President. I'm not going to the precinct. I'll probably do early vote. I'll fill out my form. Don't worry, I'll be voting.", "timestamp": "2016-10-07", "title": "Remarks Following a Briefing on Hurricane Matthew Preparedness and Response Efforts and an Exchange With Reporters"}

So this is a pretty intimate group. We're all friends. I'm not going to give a long speech. I'm not going to spend a lot of time on Trump.

But in case you hadn't noticed—[laughter]—the stakes in this election are extraordinary.\nWe have made unbelievable progress over the last 8 years: taking an economy that was in a tailspin and cutting the unemployment rate in half; creating jobs for 72 consecutive months; reducing poverty by the largest percentage since 1968; seeing wages increase by the largest percentage ever recorded over the last year; providing 20 million people with health insurance that didn't have it before; locking in a climate change plan that has actually reduced our greenhouse emissions, even as the economy has grown, and mobilizing 200 nations to join us in that effort.\nNone of this I could have done had it not been for the partnership with the Democrats in the House of Representatives. A lot of the work that we got done that saved the economy and put us on a clean energy track and ensured that health care got done was in those first 2 years when we had the Democratic majority. It was when we had a Democratic majority that we were able to significantly expand the help that we provide young people going to college, increasing the levels of Pell grants, making sure that we had a Consumer Finance Protection Bureau that is looking after consumers. A whole range of the initiatives around Wall Street reform that has made our financial system more stable. We could not have done that unless we had courageous, thoughtful Members of Congress in partnership with me.\nNow, I'm confident that we will have an incredibly capable Democratic successor in the White House by the name of Hillary Rodham Clinton. And when I say I'm confident, I'm not overconfident. [Laughter] So we've still got a lot of work to do and nobody knows that more than she does. But even if we're able to maintain the White House, the ability of Hillary to build on the legacy that we've established these past 8 years is going to depend on, ultimately, what happens in the House, as well as our ability to take back the Senate.\nAnd it's an uphill battle—Nancy is the first to acknowledge it—because of gerrymandering, because of population distribution, because during midterms we tend to have really depressed voter turnout. But despite all that, we have incredible candidates, competitive races, and if we are able and willing to really bear down in this last month—if we are, as we say in church, cheerful givers—[laughter]—then I think we've got a real shot. And that will make all the difference in the world in terms of our ability to advance those elements of my agenda that we haven't been able to get done.\nWe still need to get immigration reform done. We still need to rebuild our infrastructure all across the country and put people back to work, and make this economy more productive. We still need to make sure that every very young child has access to early childhood education. We've still got work to do in terms of making sure that equal pay for equal work is realized in workplaces all across the country. We still have work to do in building on the clean energy legacy that we have established.\nSo across the board, whatever your issue, the stakes could not be higher and I hope that all of you feel that same sense of urgency. I'm confident you do, but if there are any remaining holdouts here—[laughter]—who need to be persuaded, hopefully, when you leave here, you don't feel like you did what you were supposed to do and kind of checked that off the list, but instead, that you are even more enthusiastic and inspired, and you're willing to go out there and get your friends and neighbors and get them engaged and involved the way I know you can do, because you've done it for me. All right? Thank you very much, everybody.", "timestamp": "2016-10-07", "title": "Remarks at a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Luncheon in Chicago, Illinois"}

The Nobel Committee made the right decision in welcoming his tireless efforts to bring a just and lasting peace to Colombia, sending a message that in a world of conflict the pursuit of peace must be supported and encouraged. As Colombia turns away from the longest running war in the Western Hemisphere, this award is a testament to President Santos' unwavering, courageous leadership through years of difficult negotiations. The Colombian people have shown extraordinary resilience over several decades, and they now have a chance to pursue a future defined by the progress that can come from a just and lasting peace.\nGoing forward, President Santos and the people of Colombia can continue to count on a partner in the United States. The United States was proud to support the negotiations in Havana and to announce a new chapter in our relationship, Peace Colombia, which will continue our bipartisan tradition of support to Colombia by providing a framework to reinforce security gains, reintegrate former combatants into society and extend opportunity and the rule of law.\nThe democratic vote this week is a reminder that there is still work to be done to realize the future for which President Santos and so many citizens are striving, but it's also a sign that the national dialogue Colombia needs is taking place now and is building on the momentum created by 4 years of difficult negotiations.

Throughout the past decade, the number of fires—and of resulting deaths and injuries—has gone down. But residential fires still damage homes across our country, causing a higher percentage of fire deaths, injuries, and economic loss than any other fires, and wildfires continue to devastate our forests and threaten nearby homes and businesses. During Fire Prevention Week, we strive to increase our preparedness for fires and commit to giving dedicated firefighters the support they need to keep us safe.\nEvery moment counts during a fire, and smoke alarms help save lives. However, many people do not know that their smoke alarms should be replaced every 10 years—after 10 years, they tend to become unreliable. I encourage everyone to check the manufacturing dates of their smoke alarms to see if they need replacing. Families and businesses should also develop and practice evacuation plans in case of emergencies and should prepare communication strategies in case of a fire. All Americans can learn more about steps they can take to prepare for fires by visiting www.Ready.gov.\nIn recent years, we have experienced some of the most severe wildfire seasons in American history, including roughly 50,000 wildfires and over 9 million acres burned last year alone. Climate change exacerbates wildfire risks through drier landscapes and higher temperatures—we must recognize the effects our changing climate has on fire risks and help fire professionals and community leaders take action to enhance community resilience against these risks. Last year, my Administration brought together fire chiefs from around our country to identify key lessons learned from fires at the wildland-urban interface and actions that can be taken to reduce the harm to people and property associated with wildfires in these areas, where fighting fires is especially complicated, expensive, and dangerous. We need to be smarter about where we build, and we must work to better understand how fires behave so our firefighters can work more safely and effectively—we owe these heroic professionals nothing less.\nThis week presents opportunities for businesses, families, and communities to learn about ways to protect themselves in case of fire and helps raise awareness of steps we can all take to prevent fires. During Fire Prevention Week, we also pause to honor our first responders and firefighters, including those who have sacrificed their own lives to save the lives of people they had never met. Let us salute them and pay tribute to all firefighters whose bravery, sense of duty, and love of country make our Nation a stronger, safer place.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 9 through October 15, 2016, as Fire Prevention Week. On Sunday, October 9, 2016, in accordance with Public Law 107-51, the flag of the United States will be flown at half-staff at all Federal office buildings in honor of the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service. I call on all Americans to participate in this observance with appropriate programs and activities and by renewing their efforts to prevent fires and their tragic consequences.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-10-07", "title": "Proclamation 9517—Fire Prevention Week, 2016"}

As we observe the 70th anniversary of this program, we recommit to ensuring access to proper nutrition throughout the school day for all our young people so that they may pursue their education and chase their dreams.\nSince the beginning of my Administration, I have worked to build on the legacy of the National School Lunch Program. In 2010, the Congress passed and I signed into law the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, which increased the number of students who could get subsidized or free school meals and improved the quality of school meals. For children from low-income households, meals provided by the National School Lunch Program and the School Breakfast Program may be their only reliable source of nutrition throughout the day. We are working to increase access for more children, including by using Medicaid data to automatically connect eligible students in need to free or reduced-priced meals.\nDuring the school year, nearly 22 million children receive free and reduced-price school meals. When school is out for the summer, well over 2 million children rely on the Summer Food Service Program for nourishment. However, too many kids still lack access to adequate nutrition during the summer months, which is why I proposed investing $12 billion in my latest budget to provide supplemental summer food benefits to children who receive free and subsidized school meals during the academic year.\nWe must also work to give children greater access to nutritious foods and empower them to make healthy choices. Too many young people are obese or overweight and remain at risk for health problems like diabetes or heart disease later in life. First Lady Michelle Obama has championed efforts to build healthy futures for all children, particularly through the Let's Move! initiative, which has worked to provide healthier meals in our schools and ensure every family has access to healthy, affordable food. The Department of Agriculture updated school nutrition standards to make sure all school meals and snacks meet science-based nutrition criteria, and almost all schools participating in the National School Lunch Program are meeting these standards.\nIn order for our children to join the most prepared and educated workforce in the world, we must remember the connection between what our kids eat and how well they perform in school. During National School Lunch Week, let us reaffirm our dedication to helping America's daughters and sons succeed by guaranteeing they have access to the healthy meals they need. Let us express our gratitude for the school nutrition professionals, educators, and administrators who are helping deliver the promise of a bright future to schoolchildren across America each day. The Congress, by joint resolution of October 9, 1962 (Public Law 87-780), as amended, has designated the week beginning on the second Sunday in October each year as \"National School Lunch Week\" and has requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this week.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim October 9 through October 15, 2016, as National School Lunch Week. I call upon all Americans to join the dedicated individuals who administer the National School Lunch Program in appropriate activities that support the health and well-being of our Nation's children.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-10-07", "title": "Proclamation 9518—National School Lunch Week, 2016"}

A son of Iceland and grandson of Norway, Erikson and his crew are believed to be the first Europeans to reach the shores of our continent, founding the Vinland settlement in modern-day Canada. Today, we recall Leif Erikson's historic journey as we seek to carry forward the bold spirit of exploration that has inspired Nordic Americans for generations.\nEight centuries after Leif Erikson's trip, six families of Norwegians boarded a ship called Restauration bound for New York City. Following in Erikson's footsteps, these individuals sought the promise of freedom and opportunity America offered and became the first group of organized American immigrants from Norway. Millions of Americans proudly trace their ancestry to Nordic countries, raised by parents and grandparents who crossed oceans to carve out new lives for their families and help steer the course of our country. The United States and our Nordic partners are united by ties of family and friendship, history and heritage. Earlier this year, I was proud to welcome Nordic leaders to the White House. This visit illustrated many of the values and interests we share—including increasing opportunity for all and recognizing the inherent dignity of every human being.\nNordic countries remain some of our most reliable and effective partners, steadfastly helping us meet the shared challenges of our time. We remain grateful for their friendship, and for the ways the Nordic people have influenced our country and enhanced the American melting pot. On Leif Erikson Day, as we express our appreciation for the myriad contributions of Nordic Americans, let us remember the discovery that set this profound history in motion.\nTo honor Leif Erikson and celebrate our Nordic-American heritage, the Congress, by joint resolution (Public Law 88-566) approved on September 2, 1964, has authorized the President of the United States to proclaim October 9 of each year as \"Leif Erikson Day.\"\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim October 9, 2016, as Leif Erikson Day.

Sponsored by Isabella I and Ferdinand II, Columbus embarked on a 10-week voyage he had hoped would lead to Asia. But when his ships instead landed in the Bahamas, a new story began to unfold. The spirit of exploration that Columbus embodied was sustained by all who would follow him westward, driving a desire to continue expanding our understanding of the world.\nThough Columbus departed from the coast of Spain, his roots traced back to his birthplace of Genoa, Italy. Blazing a trail for generations of Italian explorers and Italian Americans to eventually seek the promise of the New World, his voyage churned the gears of history. The bonds between Italy and the United States could not be closer than they are today—a reflection of the extraordinary contributions made by both our peoples in our common efforts to shape a better future. Across our Nation, Italian Americans continue to enrich our country's traditions and culture.\nAs we mark this rich history, we must also acknowledge the pain and suffering reflected in the stories of Native Americans who had long resided on this land prior to the arrival of European newcomers. The past we share is marked by too many broken promises, as well as violence, deprivation, and disease. It is a history that we must recognize as we seek to build a brighter future—side by side and with cooperation and mutual respect. We have made great progress together in recent years, and we will keep striving to maintain strong nation-to-nation relationships, strengthen tribal sovereignty, and help all our communities thrive.\nMore than five centuries ago, one journey changed the trajectory of our world—and today we recognize the spirit that Christopher Columbus's legacy inspired. As we reflect on the adventurers throughout history who charted new courses and sought new heights, let us remember the communities who suffered, and let us pay tribute to our heritage and embrace the multiculturalism that defines the American experience.\nIn commemoration of Christopher Columbus's historic voyage 524 years ago, the Congress, by joint resolution of April 30, 1934, and modified in 1968 (36 U.S.C. 107), as amended, has requested the President proclaim the second Monday of October of each year as \"Columbus Day.\"\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim October 10, 2016, as Columbus Day.

Rising quickly to the rank of Brigadier General in the Continental Army, he reformed our cavalry, saved the life of General George Washington, and helped secure our independence. Today, we celebrate the legacy of liberty he forged and reflect on the many ways Polish-American voices continue to shape the unending story of our Nation.\nSpending his formative years in Poland laboring for his home country's independence, General Pulaski came to America with both an expertise in combat and a passion for liberty that made him invaluable to our new Nation's fight for freedom. Leading a legion of men on horseback and working alongside General Washington, General Pulaski achieved victory after victory. But he would never see the results of his valiant efforts fully realized—he succumbed to battle injuries on October 11, 1779, giving his final full measure of devotion in defense of the ideals we cherish.\nMore than 200 years later, Polish Americans across our country honor the spirit of General Pulaski through their many contributions to our Nation and through living the values that unite us all. The proud members of the Polish-American community strengthen the rich heritage of our country—many serve in our Armed Forces, protecting the very freedoms General Pulaski helped secure centuries before—and they reflect the strong friendship that endures today between the United States and Poland.\nOn General Pulaski Memorial Day, we commemorate one of our Nation's earliest embodiments of the belief that no matter who you are or where you come from, those who love this country can change it for the better. In honor of General Pulaski's sacrifice and the important role Polish Americans play in our country, let us rededicate ourselves to defending our founding ideal of liberty for all.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 11, 2016, as General Pulaski Memorial Day.

Although we have made life significantly better for our daughters than it was for our mothers and grandmothers, in too many parts of the world, girls are still undervalued, disrespected, abused, and prevented from contributing to society. On International Day of the Girl, we recognize our obligation to lift up women and girls at home and abroad and to build a world where all girls feel safe and empowered in their classrooms, their communities, and their homes.\nMy Administration is committed to combating gender disparities, and through the White House Council on Women and Girls, we have made it a priority to consider the needs of women and girls in our policies, laws, and programs. Today, more American women have the freedom to make their own choices about their lives—about their bodies, their education, their career. The Affordable Care Act has ensured that more girls have access to quality, affordable health care and that no health insurer can charge them more simply because of their gender. By encouraging the media to depict more examples of women in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields—and by working to expand access to STEM classes and careers, particularly computer science—we are striving to address inequalities in education. We will continue to pursue policies that advance gender equality here at home, from equal pay for equal work to protecting reproductive rights, because while some girls have never had more opportunities, there are still many who remain in the toughest of circumstances.\nUnder the leadership of Vice President Joe Biden, we are working to put an end to violence against women, and we have launched a movement to fight sexual assault and support survivors. Through the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault and the \"It's On Us\" campaign, we are shining a light on the unconscionable rates of sexual assault against teens and young adults in primary and secondary schools and on college campuses. My Administration recently announced new guidance and resources to help district administrators and educators prevent and appropriately deal with sexual assault in K-12 settings. We have also provided guidance to educators on ways to address harassment and discrimination of students in school settings, including transgender girls and women—who too often face bullying and abuse that harm their education. The Department of Justice also released guidance to identify and prevent gender bias in law enforcement responses to sexual assault and domestic violence cases. And because 84 percent of American Indian and Alaska Native women and girls will experience some form of violence in their lifetimes, we have protected the ability of tribes to prosecute non-Native perpetrators of domestic violence in Indian Country through provisions included in the 2013 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.\nAs we work to expand opportunities here in the United States, we must also look abroad and acknowledge that any country that oppresses half of its population—that prevents women and girls from going to school or work or refuses to give them control over their bodies or safety from gender-motivated abuse—is not a society that can thrive. The ideologies that harm girls and prevent them from fulfilling their potential are the same ideologies that have led countries to instability, violence, and terrorism. That is why earlier this year, we launched the U.S. Global Strategy to Empower Adolescent Girls—a strategy aimed at bringing Federal agencies together to comprehensively improve the lives of girls around the world, safeguard their rights, and encourage their full social, political, and economic participation. To specifically focus on the challenge of adolescent girls' education, First Lady Michelle Obama and I launched the Let Girls Learn initiative, through which we are working with companies, organizations, and foreign governments to help give adolescent girls around the world the chance to go to school—because a world in which all girls have access to an education is a safer, fairer, and more stable place. The initiative includes more than a billion dollars for funding new and ongoing programming in more than 50 countries to help adolescent girls attend and stay in school. And the White House will soon host the first meeting of the North American Working Group on Violence against Indigenous Women and Girls to champion regional coordination on the rights of women and girls from indigenous communities across North America.\nAround the world—from Africa to Southeast Asia to Latin America—we are striving to improve girls' welfare, build their skills, and promote their participation as the next generation of leaders. We are working to prevent and respond to violence against women and girls in fragile settings as well as support refugees and displaced persons around the world. We are undertaking targeted efforts to address child, early, and forced marriage, and we are investing in new programs, including survivor-led programs, to end female genital mutilation and cutting in seven countries across Southeast Asia and West Africa. In sub-Saharan Africa, we are helping adolescent girls pay for and attend school, while ensuring they learn about HIV and violence prevention. We have sponsored \"Women in Science\" camps in Peru and Rwanda to give girls abroad the opportunity to learn how to use technology to improve their communities. We are also working with Pakistan to advance women's economic participation and entrepreneurship and launch the country's first \"Take Your Daughter to Work Day.\" And we remain committed to ending human trafficking and have taken unprecedented steps to provide comprehensive services to victims, bring traffickers to justice, apply new technologies to combat modern slavery, and provide training and promote awareness at home and abroad.\nThis summer, 5,000 leaders from around the world gathered at the first ever United State of Women Summit to highlight the work we have done and to build an agenda for the future. But we know there is still more to do, and I have made advancing gender equality a foreign policy priority to ensure we can continue removing barriers that prevent women from reaching their full potential. More than our policies, we must commit to changing the culture that raises our daughters to be demure or criticizes them for speaking out—and to changing the attitude that permits the routine harassment of women and girls, whether walking down the street or going online. We are working with communities and businesses that are rethinking workplace policies, funding women entrepreneurs, expanding female leadership, and creating more opportunities for women and girls who too often face disproportionate challenges—including women and girls of color, women and girls with disabilities, and lesbian, bisexual, and transgender women and girls—because everyone has a role to play and everybody deserves the chance to pursue their dreams.\nThis is the future we are forging: Where women and girls, no matter what they look like or where they are from, can live free from the fear of violence. A future where all girls know they can hold any job, run any company, and compete in any field. Today, we recommit ourselves to the belief that when everyone has the opportunity to go to school, explore their passions, and achieve their dreams, our communities are stronger, more resilient, and better positioned for peace and prosperity. Let us keep working to build a world that is more just and free—because nothing should stand in the way of strong girls with bold dreams.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 11, 2016, as International Day of the Girl. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with programs, ceremonies, and activities that advance equality and opportunity for girls everywhere.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-10-07", "title": "Proclamation 9522—International Day of the Girl, 2016"}

Biden, Jr., President of the Senate.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119090", "text": "Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:)\nConsistent with subsection 204(b) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(b), I hereby report that I have issued an Executive Order (the \"order\") that terminates the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13047 of May 20, 1997, and revokes that order, Executive Order 13310 of July 28, 2003, Executive Order 13448 of October 18, 2007, Executive Order 13464 of April 30, 2008, Executive Order 13619 of July 11, 2012, and Executive Order 13651 of August 6, 2013.\nThe President issued Executive Order 13047 to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States posed by the actions and policies of the Government of Burma, in response to a deepening pattern of severe repression by the State Law and Order Restoration Council, the then-governing regime in Burma. In Executive Order 13047, the President also determined and certified that, for purposes of section 570(b) of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1997 (Public Law 104-208), the Government of Burma had committed large-scale repression of the democratic opposition in Burma after September 30, 1996, and imposed a prohibition on new investment in Burma. The scope of the national emergency with respect to Burma was modified and additional steps were taken to respond to the threat posed by the actions and policies of the Government of Burma, and further actions were taken under Burma sanctions statutes, namely the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-61) and the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE (Junta's Anti-Democratic Efforts) Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-286) (the \"JADE Act\"), in Executive Orders 13310, 13448, 13464, 13619, and 13651.\nIn the order, I have determined that the situation that gave rise to the national emergency with respect to Burma has been significantly altered by Burma's substantial advances to promote democracy, including historic elections in November 2015 that resulted in the former opposition party, the National League for Democracy, winning a majority of seats in the national parliament and the formation of a democratically elected, civilian-led government; the release of many political prisoners; and greater enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms, including freedom of expression and freedom of association and peaceful assembly. With these advancements, U.S. national security and foreign policy interests no longer support the blocking of assets and other measures imposed by Executive Orders 13047, 13310, 13448, 13464, 13619, and 13651. For these reasons I have determined that it is necessary to terminate the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13047 and to revoke that order, and Executive Orders 13310, 13448, 13464, 13619, and 13651. While Burma faces significant challenges, including the consolidation of its democracy, the United States can, and intends to, use other means to support the government and people of Burma in their efforts to address these challenges.\nI hereby report to the Congress that, pursuant to section 5(i) of the JADE Act, I have determined and certify that it is in the national interest of the United States to waive, and have waived, the sanctions described in section 5(b) of the JADE Act. I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.\nSincerely,\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-10-07", "title": "Letter to Congressional Leaders on Termination of Emergency With Respect to the Actions and Policies of the Government of Burma"}

Even as we assist Saudi Arabia regarding the defense of their territorial integrity, we have and will continue to express our serious concerns about the conflict in Yemen and how it has been waged. In light of this and other recent incidents, we have initiated an immediate review of our already significantly reduced support to the Saudi-led Coalition and are prepared to adjust our support so as to better align with U.S. principles, values and interests, including achieving an immediate and durable end to Yemen's tragic conflict. We call upon the Saudi-led Coalition, the Yemeni government, the Houthis and the Saleh-aligned forces to commit publicly to an immediate cessation of hostilities and implement this cessation based on the April 10th terms.", "timestamp": "2016-10-08", "title": "Press Release - Statement by NSC Spokesperson Ned Price on Yemen"}

Eight years ago, we were in the early stages of what would become the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes. It was a scary time. We didn't even know where the bottom would be.\nBut thanks to your hard work and your determination and some smart decisions we made, today's a different story. We turned a recession into a record streak of job growth, creating more than 15 million new private sector jobs and cutting the unemployment rate in half.\nGetting wages to rise again was a harder task. Even before the recession, working Americans faced decades of slow wage growth. Between 1980 and 2007, real wages barely grew each year. But because the policies we've put in place are working, working families are finally seeing their wages and incomes rise too. Since 2012, wages have grown around 20 times faster than they did over the almost three decades between 1980 and 2007.\nLast year, folks' typical household income rose by $2,800. That's the single biggest increase on record. And across every race and age group in America, incomes rose, and poverty rates fell. We lifted 3.5 million people out of poverty, the largest 1-year drop in the poverty rate since 1968.\nWhat's more, lower- and middle-income families saw the biggest boost in incomes, in part because 18 States and the District, as well as more than 50 communities, have given millions of Americans a raise by raising the minimum wage. And States that have raised their minimum wage have seen stronger earnings growth in low-wage jobs compared to States that have not.\nStrengthening benefits at work helps too. Last week, for example, I took action to make sure up to 1 million more workers can earn 7 days of paid sick leave on the job. We're also helping States expand opportunities for workers to save for retirement. But there's a lot more we should do to strengthen the middle class and help more Americans get ahead: making childcare more affordable, for example; making sure women earn equal pay for equal work; guaranteeing paid family and sick leave; increasing the Federal minimum wage; preparing workers for the jobs of the future; and closing tax loopholes that benefit just the wealthy and big corporations.\nNow we just need a Congress that cares about these issues, one that will finally put politics aside and act on these commonsense ideas. And that's how we'll build on the progress we've made over these past 8 years and achieve one thing we should all agree on: securing a brighter future for all of our children.\nThanks, everybody. And have a great weekend.", "timestamp": "2016-10-08", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

Trump, and the Democratic nominee for president, Hillary Clinton. [applause]\nCOOPER: Thank you very much for being here. We're going to begin with a question from one of the members in our town hall. Each of you will have two minutes to respond to this question. Secretary Clinton, you won the coin toss, so you'll go first. Our first question comes from Patrice Brock. Patrice?\nQUESTION: Thank you, and good evening. The last debate could have been rated as MA, mature audiences, per TV parental guidelines. Knowing that educators assign viewing the presidential debates as students' homework, do you feel you're modeling appropriate and positive behavior for today's youth?\nCLINTON: Well, thank you. Are you a teacher? Yes, I think that that's a very good question, because I've heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign.\nAnd I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we're good. And we are going to respect one another, lift each other up. We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them in to working on behalf of our country.\nI have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together. That's why the slogan of my campaign is \"Stronger Together,\" because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals—and I've set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else.\nIf we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them, there's nothing in my opinion that America can't do. So that's why I hope that we will come together in this campaign. Obviously, I'm hoping to earn your vote, I'm hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you, I will work with every American.\nI want to be the president for all Americans, regardless of your political beliefs, where you come from, what you look like, your religion. I want us to heal our country and bring it together because that's, I think, the best way for us to get the future that our children and our grandchildren deserve.\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, thank you. Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.\nTRUMP: Well, I actually agree with that. I agree with everything she said. I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country. This is a great country. This is a great land. I've gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that I've been doing this as a politician. I cannot believe I'm saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician.\nAnd my whole concept was to make America great again. When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what's happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it's a one-sided transaction where we're giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we've made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago.\nWhen I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether it's in business and trade, where we're doing so badly. Last year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit. In other words, trading with other countries. We had an $800 billion deficit. It's hard to believe. Inconceivable.\nYou say who's making these deals? We're going the make great deals. We're going to have a strong border. We're going to bring back law and order. Just today, policemen was shot, two killed. And this is happening on a weekly basis. We have to bring back respect to law enforcement. At the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides. We need justice.\nBut I want to do things that haven't been done, including fixing and making our inner cities better for the African-American citizens that are so great, and for the Latinos, Hispanics, and I look forward to doing it. It's called make America great again.\nCOOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump. The question from Patrice was about are you both modeling positive and appropriate behavior for today's youth? We received a lot of questions online, Mr. Trump, about the tape that was released on Friday, as you can imagine. You called what you said locker room banter. You described kissing women without consent, grabbing their genitals. That is sexual assault. You bragged that you have sexually assaulted women. Do you understand that?\nTRUMP: No, I didn't say that at all. I don't think you understood what was—this was locker room talk. I'm not proud of it. I apologize to my family. I apologize to the American people. Certainly I'm not proud of it. But this is locker room talk.\nYou know, when we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads, where you have—and, frankly, drowning people in steel cages, where you have wars and horrible, horrible sights all over, where you have so many bad things happening, this is like medieval times. We haven't seen anything like this, the carnage all over the world.\nAnd they look and they see. Can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS? And they look at our country and they see what's going on.\nYes, I'm very embarrassed by it. I hate it. But it's locker room talk, and it's one of those things. I will knock the hell out of ISIS. We're going to defeat ISIS. ISIS happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment. And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS.\nCOOPER: So, Mr. Trump...\nTRUMP: And we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things.\nCOOPER: Just for the record, though, are you saying that what you said on that bus 11 years ago that you did not actually kiss women without consent or grope women without consent?\nTRUMP: I have great respect for women. Nobody has more respect for women than I do.\nCOOPER: So, for the record, you're saying you never did that?\nTRUMP: I've said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said. And I was embarrassed by it. But I have tremendous respect for women.\nCOOPER: Have you ever done those things?\nTRUMP: And women have respect for me. And I will tell you: No, I have not. And I will tell you that I'm going to make our country safe. We're going to have borders in our country, which we don't have now. People are pouring into our country, and they're coming in from the Middle East and other places.\nWe're going to make America safe again. We're going to make America great again, but we're going to make America safe again. And we're going to make America wealthy again, because if you don't do that, it just—it sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation.\nCOOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.\nTRUMP: Right now, other nations are taking our jobs and they're taking our wealth.\nCOOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.\nTRUMP: And that's what I want to talk about.\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond?\nCLINTON: Well, like everyone else, I've spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw. You know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve.\nDonald Trump is different. I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief. And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing. What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women. And he has said that the video doesn't represent who he is.\nBut I think it's clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is. Because we've seen this throughout the campaign. We have seen him insult women. We've seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to ten. We've seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter. We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms.\nSo, yes, this is who Donald Trump is. But it's not only women, and it's not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African- Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others.\nSo this is who Donald Trump is. And the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are. That's why—to go back to your question—I want to send a message—we all should—to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity.\nThese are very important values to me, because this is the America that I know and love. And I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if I'm so fortunate enough to become your president.\nRADDATZ: And we want to get to some questions from online...\nTRUMP: Am I allowed to respond to that? I assume I am.\nRADDATZ: Yes, you can respond to that.\nTRUMP: It's just words, folks. It's just words. Those words, I've been hearing them for many years. I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed.\nI've heard them where Hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country, which are a disaster education-wise, jobwise, safety-wise, in every way possible. I'm going to help the African-Americans. I'm going to help the Latinos, Hispanics. I am going to help the inner cities.\nShe's done a terrible job for the African-Americans. She wants their vote, and she does nothing, and then she comes back four years later. We saw that firsthand when she was United States senator. She campaigned where the primary part of her campaign...\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump—I want to get to audience questions and online questions.\nTRUMP: So, she's allowed to do that, but I'm not allowed to respond?\nRADDATZ: You're going to have—you're going to get to respond right now.\nTRUMP: Sounds fair.\nRADDATZ: This tape is generating intense interest. In just 48 hours, it's become the single most talked about story of the entire 2016 election on Facebook, with millions and millions of people discussing it on the social network. As we said a moment ago, we do want to bring in questions from voters around country via social media, and our first stays on this topic. Jeff from Ohio asks on Facebook, \"Trump says the campaign has changed him. When did that happen?\" So, Mr. Trump, let me add to that. When you walked off that bus at age 59, were you a different man or did that behavior continue until just recently? And you have two minutes for this.\nTRUMP: It was locker room talk, as I told you. That was locker room talk. I'm not proud of it. I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country. And certainly, I'm not proud of it. But that was something that happened.\nIf you look at Bill Clinton, far worse. Mine are words, and his was action. His was what he's done to women. There's never been anybody in the history politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women. So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women.\nHillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously. Four of them here tonight. One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12. Her client she represented got him off, and she's seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped. Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight.\nSo don't tell me about words. I am absolutely—I apologize for those words. But it is things that people say. But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law. He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women. Paula Jones, who's also here tonight.\nAnd I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago, I think it's disgraceful, and I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth. [applause]\nRADDATZ: Can we please hold the applause? Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes.\nCLINTON: Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses. He gets to decide what he wants to talk about. Instead of answering people's questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, that's his choice.\nWhen I hear something like that, I am reminded of what my friend, Michelle Obama, advised us all: When they go low, you go high. [applause]\nAnd, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he's saying tonight would be understandable, but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women. But he never apologizes for anything to anyone.\nHe never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died in the line of duty in Iraq. And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion.\nHe never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana, but Donald said he couldn't be trusted to be a judge because his parents were, quote, \"Mexican.\"\nHe never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching. And he never apologized for the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United States of America. He owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words.\nTRUMP: Well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal—he's another real winner that you have—and he's the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that. So you really owe him an apology. You're the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb. That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology.\nNumber two, Michelle Obama. I've gotten to see the commercials that they did on you. And I've gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I've ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary.\nSo, you talk about friend? Go back and take a look at those commercials, a race where you lost fair and square, unlike the Bernie Sanders race, where you won, but not fair and square, in my opinion. And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance. And I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil.\nBut when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing.\nAnd I'll tell you what. I didn't think I'd say this, but I'm going to say it, and I hate to say it. But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception. There has never been anything like it, and we're going to have a special prosecutor.\nWhen I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious. In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious. There has never been anything like this, where e-mails—and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process.\nSo we're going to get a special prosecutor, and we're going to look into it, because you know what? People have been—their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you've done. And it's a disgrace. And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.\nRADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, I want to follow up on that.\n[crosstalk]\nRADDATZ: I'm going to let you talk about e-mails.\nCLINTON: ... because everything he just said is absolutely false, but I'm not surprised.\nTRUMP: Oh, really?\nCLINTON: In the first debate...[laughter]\nRADDATZ: And really, the audience needs to calm down here.\nCLINTON: ... I told people that it would be impossible to be fact-checking Donald all the time. I'd never get to talk about anything I want to do and how we're going to really make lives better for people.\nSo, once again, go to HillaryClinton.com. We have literally Trump—you can fact check him in real time. Last time at the first debate, we had millions of people fact checking, so I expect we'll have millions more fact checking, because, you know, it is—it's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.\nTRUMP: Because you'd be in jail. [applause]\nRADDATZ: Secretary Clinton...\nCOOPER: We want to remind the audience to please not talk out loud. Please do not applaud. You're just wasting time.\nRADDATZ: And, Secretary Clinton, I do want to follow up on e- mails. You've said your handing of your e-mails was a mistake. You disagreed with FBI Director James Comey, calling your handling of classified information, quote, \"extremely careless.\" The FBI said that there were 110 classified e-mails that were exchanged, eight of which were top secret, and that it was possible hostile actors did gain access to those e-mails. You don't call that extremely careless?\nCLINTON: Well, Martha, first, let me say—and I've said before, but I'll repeat it, because I want everyone to hear it—that was a mistake, and I take responsibility for using a personal e-mail account. Obviously, if I were to do it over again, I would not. I'm not making any excuses. It was a mistake. And I am very sorry about that.\nBut I think it's also important to point out where there are some misleading accusations from critics and others. After a year-long investigation, there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server I was using and there is no evidence that anyone can point to at all—anyone who says otherwise has no basis—that any classified material ended up in the wrong hands.\nI take classified materials very seriously and always have. When I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was privy to a lot of classified material. Obviously, as secretary of state, I had some of the most important secrets that we possess, such as going after bin Laden. So I am very committed to taking classified information seriously. And as I said, there is no evidence that any classified information ended up in the wrong hands.\nRADDATZ: OK, we're going to move on.\nTRUMP: And yet she didn't know the word—the letter C on a document. Right? She didn't even know what that word—what that letter meant.\nYou know, it's amazing. I'm watching Hillary go over facts. And she's going after fact after fact, and she's lying again, because she said she—you know, what she did with the e-mail was fine. You think it was fine to delete 33,000 e-mails? I don't think so.\nShe said the 33,000 e-mails had to do with her daughter's wedding, number one, and a yoga class. Well, maybe we'll give three or three or four or five or something. 33,000 e-mails deleted, and now she's saying there wasn't anything wrong.\nAnd more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena. That wasn't before. That was after. She got it from the United States Congress. And I'll be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen.\nOur Justice Department, where our husband goes on to the back of a airplane for 39 minutes, talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case. But for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 e-mails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself. What you did—and this is after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.\nCOOPER: We have to move on.\nTRUMP: You did that. Wait a minute. One second.\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, you can respond, and then we got to move on.\nRADDATZ: We want to give the audience a chance.\nTRUMP: If you did that in the private sector, you'd be put in jail, let alone after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, you can respond. Then we have to move on to an audience question.\nCLINTON: Look, it's just not true. And so please, go to...\nTRUMP: Oh, you didn't delete them?\nCOOPER: Allow her to respond, please.\nCLINTON: It was personal e-mails, not official.\nTRUMP: Oh, 33,000? Yeah.\nCLINTON: Not—well, we turned over 35,000, so...\nTRUMP: Oh, yeah. What about the other 15,000?\nCOOPER: Please allow her to respond. She didn't talk while you talked.\nCLINTON: Yes, that's true, I didn't.\nTRUMP: Because you have nothing to say.\nCLINTON: I didn't in the first debate, and I'm going to try not to in this debate, because I'd like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about.\nTRUMP: Get off this question.\nCLINTON: OK, Donald. I know you're into big diversion tonight, anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it's exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you. But let's at least focus...\nTRUMP: Let's see what happens...[crosstalk]\nCOOPER: Allow her to respond.\nCLINTON: ... on some of the issues that people care about tonight. Let's get to their questions.\nCOOPER: We have a question here from Ken Karpowicz. He has a question about health care. Ken?\nTRUMP: I'd like to know, Anderson, why aren't you bringing up the e-mails? I'd like to know. Why aren't you bringing...\nCOOPER: We brought up the e-mails.\nTRUMP: No, it hasn't. It hasn't. And it hasn't been finished at all.\nCOOPER: Ken Karpowicz has a question.\nTRUMP: It's nice to—one on three.\nQUESTION: Thank you. Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, it is not affordable. Premiums have gone up. Deductibles have gone up. Copays have gone up. Prescriptions have gone up. And the coverage has gone down. What will you do to bring the cost down and make coverage better?\nCOOPER: That first one goes to Secretary Clinton, because you started out the last one to the audience.\nCLINTON: If he wants to start, he can start. No, go ahead, Donald.\nTRUMP: No, I'm a gentlemen, Hillary. Go ahead. [laughter]\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton?\nCLINTON: Well, I think Donald was about to say he's going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act. And I'm going to fix it, because I agree with you. Premiums have gotten too high. Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and I've laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down.\nBut here's what I don't want people to forget when we're talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn't just that 20 million got insurance who didn't have it before. But that in and of itself was a good thing. I meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families.\nBut everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employees got big benefits. Number one, insurance companies can't deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition. Number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems.\nNumber three, women can't be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act. Number four, if you're under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didn't happen before.\nSo I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act. But we've got to get costs down. We've got to provide additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance. But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange. And then we would have to start all over again.\nRight now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage. That's the highest we've ever been in our country.\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, your time is up.\nCLINTON: So I want us to get to 100 percent, but get costs down and keep quality up.\nCOOPER: Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.\nTRUMP: It is such a great question and it's maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense. Obamacare is a disaster. You know it. We all know it. It's going up at numbers that nobody's ever seen worldwide. Nobody's ever seen numbers like this for health care.\nIt's only getting worse. In '17, it implodes by itself. Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money. We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt.\nObamacare will never work. It's very bad, very bad health insurance. Far too expensive. And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country. It's going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly.\nWe have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored. We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want—and President Obama and whoever was working on it—they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies. We want competition.\nYou will have the finest health care plan there is. She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to Canada. And if you haven't noticed the Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow. It's catastrophic in certain ways.\nBut she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything. Hillary Clinton has been after this for years. Obamacare was the first step. Obamacare is a total disaster. And not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody's ever believed, but your deductibles are going up, so that unless you get hit by a truck, you're never going to be able to use it.\nCOOPER: Mr. Trump, your time...\nTRUMP: It is a disastrous plan, and it has to be repealed and replaced.\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, let me follow up with you. Your husband called Obamacare, quote, \"the craziest thing in the world,\" saying that small-business owners are getting killed as premiums double, coverage is cut in half. Was he mistaken or was the mistake simply telling the truth?\nCLINTON: No, I mean, he clarified what he meant. And it's very clear. Look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system. But we have an employer-based system. That's where the vast majority of people get their health care.\nAnd the Affordable Care Act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldn't put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on Medicaid. Obviously, Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didn't have the money to afford insurance and didn't have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them.\nThat was the slot that the Obamacare approach was to take. And like I say, 20 million people now have health insurance. So if we just rip it up and throw it away, what Donald's not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be, and that means the insurance companies...\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton...\nCLINTON: ... get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, I'm sorry, you've got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthma...\nCOOPER: Your time is up.\nCLINTON: ... you may not be able to have insurance because you can't afford it. So let's fix what's broken about it, but let's not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies and the drug companies. That's not going to work.\nCOOPER: Mr. Trump, let me follow up on this.\nTRUMP: Well, I just want—just one thing. First of all, Hillary, everything's broken about it. Everything. Number two, Bernie Sanders said that Hillary Clinton has very bad judgment. This is a perfect example of it, trying to save Obamacare, which is a disaster.\nCOOPER: You've said you want to end Obamacare...\nTRUMP: By the way...\nCOOPER: You've said you want to end Obamacare. You've also said you want to make coverage accessible for people with pre-existing conditions. How do you force insurance companies to do that if you're no longer mandating that every American get insurance?\nTRUMP: We're going to be able to. You're going to have plans...\nCOOPER: What does that mean?\nTRUMP: Well, I'll tell you what it means. You're going to have plans that are so good, because we're going to have so much competition in the insurance industry. Once we break out—once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come...\nCOOPER: Are you going—are you going to have a mandate that Americans have to have health insurance?\nTRUMP: President Obama—Anderson, excuse me. President Obama, by keeping those lines, the boundary lines around each state, it was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of Obamacare, which, by the way, was a fraud. You know that, because Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, was said—he said it was a great lie, it was a big lie. President Obama said you keep your doctor, you keep your plan. The whole thing was a fraud, and it doesn't work.\nBut when we get rid of those lines, you will have competition, and we will be able to keep pre-existing, we'll also be able to help people that can't get—don't have money because we are going to have people protected.\nAnd Republicans feel this way, believe it or not, and strongly this way. We're going to block grant into the states. We're going to block grant into Medicaid into the states...\nCOOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.\nTRUMP: ... so that we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to take care of themselves.\nCOOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump.\nRADDATZ: We now go to Gorbah Hamed with a question for both candidates.\nQUESTION: Hi. There are 3.3 million Muslims in the United States, and I'm one of them. You've mentioned working with Muslim nations, but with Islamophobia on the rise, how will you help people like me deal with the consequences of being labeled as a threat to the country after the election is over?\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, you're first.\nTRUMP: Well, you're right about Islamophobia, and that's a shame. But one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that—because there is a problem. I mean, whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem. And we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on. When they see hatred going on, they have to report it.\nAs an example, in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people. Horribly wounded. They'll never be the same. Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.\nAnd, you know, there's always a reason for everything. If they don't do that, it's a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at Orlando and you look at San Bernardino and you look at the World Trade Center. Go outside. Look at Paris. Look at that horrible—these are radical Islamic terrorists.\nAnd she won't even mention the word and nor will President Obama. He won't use the term \"radical Islamic terrorism.\" Now, to solve a problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name. She won't say the name and President Obama won't say the name. But the name is there. It's radical Islamic terror. And before you solve it, you have to say the name.\nRADDATZ: Secretary Clinton?\nCLINTON: Well, thank you for asking your question. And I've heard this question from a lot of Muslim-Americans across our country, because, unfortunately, there's been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about Muslims. And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald.\nI want to say just a couple of things. First, we've had Muslims in America since George Washington. And we've had many successful Muslims. We just lost a particular well-known one with Muhammad Ali.\nMy vision of America is an America where everyone has a place, if you're willing to work hard, you do your part, you contribute to the community. That's what America is. That's what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren.\nIt's also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims. We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines. I've worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America. I've met with a lot of them, and I've heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that's what I want to see.\nIt's also important I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations. Right now, a lot of those nations are hearing what Donald says and wondering, why should we cooperate with the Americans? And this is a gift to ISIS and the terrorists, violent jihadist terrorists.\nWe are not at war with Islam. And it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are. So I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else.\nRADDATZ: Thank you, Secretary Clinton.\nMr. Trump, in December, you said this. \"Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on. We have no choice. We have no choice.\" Your running mate said this week that the Muslim ban is no longer your position. Is that correct? And if it is, was it a mistake to have a religious test?\nTRUMP: First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq. Iraq was disaster. So he would have been alive today.\nThe Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world. Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands—excuse me. Excuse me..\nRADDATZ: And why did it morph into that? No, did you—no, answer the question. Do you still believe...\nTRUMP: Why don't you interrupt her? You interrupt me all the time.\nRADDATZ: I do.\nTRUMP: Why don't you interrupt her?\nRADDATZ: Would you please explain whether or not the Muslim ban still stands?\nTRUMP: It's called extreme vetting. We are going to areas like Syria where they're coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama. And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama. People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more. This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time.\nWe have enough problems in this country. I believe in building safe zones. I believe in having other people pay for them, as an example, the Gulf states, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people. But I don't want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them. We know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country.\nRADDATZ: And, Secretary Clinton, let me ask you about that, because you have asked for an increase from 10,000 to 65,000 Syrian refugees. We know you want tougher vetting. That's not a perfect system. So why take the risk of having those refugees come into the country?\nCLINTON: Well, first of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us. But there are a lot of refugees, women and children—think of that picture we all saw of that 4-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because he'd been bombed by the Russian and Syrian air forces.\nThere are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely, I believe, because of Russian aggression. And we need to do our part. We by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that Europe and others are. But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others.\nBut it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, we're going to ban people based on a religion. How do you do that? We are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty. How do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county? Are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country? And how do we expect to be able to implement those?\nSo I thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous. And indeed, you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists sites, and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters, because they want to create a war between us.\nAnd the final thing I would say, this is the 10th or 12th time that he's denied being for the war in Iraq. We have it on tape. The entire press corps has looked at it. It's been debunked, but it never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say.\nTRUMP: That's not been debunked.\nCLINTON: So, please...\nTRUMP: That has not been debunked.\nCLINTON: ... go to HillaryClinton.com and you can see it.\nTRUMP: I was against—I was against the war in Iraq. Has not been debunked. And you voted for it. And you shouldn't have. Well, I just want to say...\nRADDATZ: There's been lots of fact-checking on that. I'd like to move on to an online question...\nTRUMP: Excuse me. She just went about 25 seconds over her time.\nRADDATZ: She did not.\nTRUMP: Could I just respond to this, please?\nRADDATZ: Very quickly, please.\nTRUMP: Hillary Clinton, in terms of having people come into our country, we have many criminal illegal aliens. When we want to send them back to their country, their country says we don't want them. In some cases, they're murderers, drug lords, drug problems. And they don't want them.\nAnd Hillary Clinton, when she was secretary of state, said that's OK, we can't force it into their country. Let me tell you, I'm going to force them right back into their country. They're murderers and some very bad people.\nAnd I will tell you very strongly, when Bernie Sanders said she had bad judgment, she has really bad judgment, because we are letting people into this country that are going to cause problems and crime like you've never seen. We're also letting drugs pour through our southern border at a record clip. At a record clip. And it shouldn't be allowed to happen.\nICE just endorsed me. They've never endorsed a presidential candidate. The Border Patrol agents, 16,500, just recently endorsed me, and they endorsed me because I understand the border. She doesn't. She wants amnesty for everybody. Come right in. Come right over. It's a horrible thing she's doing. She's got bad judgment, and honestly, so bad that she should never be president of the United States. That I can tell you.\nRADDATZ: Thank you, Mr. Trump. I want to move on. This next question from the public through the Bipartisan Open Debate Coalition's online forum, where Americans submitted questions that generated millions of votes. This question involves WikiLeaks release of purported excerpts of Secretary Clinton's paid speeches, which she has refused to release, and one line in particular, in which you, Secretary Clinton, purportedly say you need both a public and private position on certain issues. So, Tu, from Virginia asks, is it OK for politicians to be two-faced? Is it acceptable for a politician to have a private stance on issues? Secretary Clinton, your two minutes.\nCLINTON: Well, right. As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called \"Lincoln.\" It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment. It was principled, and it was strategic.\nAnd I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it. And, yes, President Lincoln was trying to convince some people, he used some arguments, convincing other people, he used other arguments. That was a great—I thought a great display of presidential leadership.\nBut, you know, let's talk about what's really going on here, Martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election. And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we don't even know if it's accurate information, and then they put it out.\nWe have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election. And believe me, they're not doing it to get me elected. They're doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump.\nNow, maybe because he has praised Putin, maybe because he says he agrees with a lot of what Putin wants to do, maybe because he wants to do business in Moscow, I don't know the reasons. But we deserve answers. And we should demand that Donald release all of his tax returns so that people can see what are the entanglements and the financial relationships that he has...\nRADDATZ: We're going to get to that later. Secretary Clinton, you're out of time.\nCLINTON: ... with the Russians and other foreign powers.\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump?\nTRUMP: Well, I think I should respond, because—so ridiculous. Look, now she's blaming—she got caught in a total lie. Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else, and she said things—WikiLeaks that just came out. And she lied. Now she's blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln. That's one that I haven't...[laughter]\nOK, Honest Abe, Honest Abe never lied. That's the good thing. That's the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you. That's a big, big difference. We're talking about some difference.\nBut as far as other elements of what she was saying, I don't know Putin. I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example. But I don't know Putin.\nBut I notice, anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians are—she doesn't know if it's the Russians doing the hacking. Maybe there is no hacking. But they always blame Russia. And the reason they blame Russia because they think they're trying to tarnish me with Russia. I know nothing about Russia. I know—I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia. I don't deal there. I have no businesses there. I have no loans from Russia.\nI have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when I did the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government, because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well, chose me to do the Old Post Office, between the White House and Congress, chose me to do the Old Post Office. One of the primary area things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet. But I have no loans with Russia. You could go to the United States government, and they would probably tell you that, because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development I had to have.\nNow, the taxes are a very simple thing. As soon as I have—first of all, I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. Many of her friends took bigger deductions. Warren Buffett took a massive deduction. Soros, who's a friend of hers, took a massive deduction. Many of the people that are giving her all this money that she can do many more commercials than me gave her—took massive deductions.\nI pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. But—but as soon as my routine audit is finished, I'll release my returns. I'll be very proud to. They're actually quite great.\nRADDATZ: Thank you, Mr. Trump.\nCOOPER: We want to turn, actually, to the topic of taxes. We have a question from Spencer Maass. Spencer?\nQUESTION: Good evening. My question is, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share in taxes?\nCOOPER: Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.\nTRUMP: Well, one thing I'd do is get rid of carried interest. One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code. And she could have done this years ago, by the way. She's a United States—she was a United States senator.\nShe complains that Donald Trump took advantage of the tax code. Well, why didn't she change it? Why didn't you change it when you were a senator? The reason you didn't is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do. And I do. You have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change. But you wouldn't change it, because all of these people gave you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump.\nBut—and I say that about a lot of things. You know, I've heard Hillary complaining about so many different things over the years. \"I wish you would have done this.\" But she's been there for 30 years she's been doing this stuff. She never changed. And she never will change. She never will change.\nWe're getting rid of carried interest provisions. I'm lowering taxes actually, because I think it's so important for corporations, because we have corporations leaving—massive corporations and little ones, little ones can't form. We're getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes.\nBut we're bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent. We're cutting taxes for the middle class. And I will tell you, we are cutting them big league for the middle class.\nAnd I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks. You can look at me. She's raising your taxes really high. And what that's going to do is a disaster for the country. But she is raising your taxes and I'm lowering your taxes. That in itself is a big difference. We are going to be thriving again. We have no growth in this country. There's no growth. If China has a GDP of 7 percent, it's like a national catastrophe. We're down at 1 percent. And that's, like, no growth. And we're going lower, in my opinion. And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world. And I'm bringing them down to one of the lower in the world. And I think it's so important—one of the most important things we can do. But she is raising everybody's taxes massively.\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes. The question was, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share of taxes?\nCLINTON: Well, everything you've heard just now from Donald is not true. I'm sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality. And it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasn't paid federal income taxes in maybe 20 years talking about what he's going to do.\nBut I'll tell you what he's going to do. His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they've ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two. Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift. And, indeed, the way that he talks about his tax cuts would end up raising taxes on middle-class families, millions of middle-class families.\nNow, here's what I want to do. I have said nobody who makes less than $250,000 a year—and that's the vast majority of Americans as you know—will have their taxes raised, because I think we've got to go where the money is. And the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code.\nAnd, yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes. I voted to close, I think, one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion-dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes.\nI want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars. It's called the Buffett rule. Yes, Warren Buffett is the one who's gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary. I want to have a surcharge on incomes above $5 million.\nWe have to make up for lost times, because I want to invest in you. I want to invest in hard-working families. And I think it's been unfortunate, but it's happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top. And we need to reverse that.\nPeople like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong.\nCOOPER: Thank you, Secretary.\nCLINTON: And we're going to make sure that nobody, no corporation, and no individual can get away without paying his fair share to support our country.\nCOOPER: Thank you. I want to give you—Mr. Trump, I want to give you the chance to respond. I just wanted to tell our viewers what she's referring to. In the last month, taxes were the number-one issue on Facebook for the first time in the campaign. The New York Times published three pages of your 1995 tax returns. They show you claimed a $916 million loss, which means you could have avoided paying personal federal income taxes for years. You've said you pay state taxes, employee taxes, real estate taxes, property taxes. You have not answered, though, a simple question. Did you use that $916 million loss to avoid paying personal federal income taxes for years?\nTRUMP: Of course I do. Of course I do. And so do all of her donors, or most of her donors. I know many of her donors. Her donors took massive tax write-offs.\nCOOPER: So have you paid personal federal income tax?\nTRUMP: A lot of my—excuse me, Anderson—a lot of my write- off was depreciation and other things that Hillary as a senator allowed. And she'll always allow it, because the people that give her all this money, they want it. That's why.\nSee, I understand the tax code better than anybody that's ever run for president. Hillary Clinton—and it's extremely complex—Hillary Clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including they want the carried interest provision, which is very important to Wall Street people. But they really want the carried interest provision, which I believe Hillary's leaving. Very interesting why she's leaving carried interest.\nBut I will tell you that, number one, I pay tremendous numbers of taxes. I absolutely used it. And so did Warren Buffett and so did George Soros and so did many of the other people that Hillary is getting money from. Now, I won't mention their names, because they're rich, but they're not famous. So we won't make them famous.\nCOOPER: So can you—can you say how many years you have avoided paying personal federal income taxes?\nTRUMP: No, but I pay tax, and I pay federal tax, too. But I have a write-off, a lot of it's depreciation, which is a wonderful charge. I love depreciation. You know, she's given it to us.\nHey, if she had a problem—for 30 years she's been doing this, Anderson. I say it all the time. She talks about health care. Why didn't she do something about it? She talks about taxes. Why didn't she do something about it? She doesn't do anything about anything other than talk. With her, it's all talk and no action.\nCOOPER: In the past...\nTRUMP: And, again, Bernie Sanders, it's really bad judgment. She has made bad judgment not only on taxes. She's made bad judgments on Libya, on Syria, on Iraq. I mean, her and Obama, whether you like it or not, the way they got out of Iraq, the vacuum they've left, that's why ISIS formed in the first place. They started from that little area, and now they're in 32 different nations, Hillary. Congratulations. Great job.\nCOOPER: Secretary—I want you to be able to respond, Secretary Clinton.\nCLINTON: Well, here we go again. I've been in favor of getting rid of carried interest for years, starting when I was a senator from New York. But that's not the point here.\nTRUMP: Why didn't you do it? Why didn't you do it?\nCOOPER: Allow her to respond.\nCLINTON: Because I was a senator with a Republican president.\nTRUMP: Oh, really?\nCLINTON: I will be the president and we will get it done. That's exactly right.\nTRUMP: You could have done it, if you were an effective—if you were an effective senator, you could have done it. If you were an effective senator, you could have done it. But you were not an effective senator.\nCOOPER: Please allow her to respond. She didn't interrupt you.\nCLINTON: You know, under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power. Look, he has now said repeatedly, \"30 years this and 30 years that.\" So let me talk about my 30 years in public service. I'm very glad to do so.\nEight million kids every year have health insurance, because when I was first lady I worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the Children's Health Insurance Program. Hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because I worked to change our adoption and foster care system. After 9/11, I went to work with Republican mayor, governor and president to rebuild New York and to get health care for our first responders who were suffering because they had run toward danger and gotten sickened by it. Hundreds of thousands of National Guard and Reserve members have health care because of work that I did, and children have safer medicines because I was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done.\nWhen I was secretary of state, I went around the world advocating for our country, but also advocating for women's rights, to make sure that women had a decent chance to have a better life and negotiated a treaty with Russia to lower nuclear weapons. Four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when I was a senator for eight years.\nI worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time. And as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington.\nCOOPER: Thank you, secretary.\nCLINTON: I've proven that I can, and for 30 years, I've produced results for people.\nCOOPER: Thank you, secretary.\nRADDATZ: We're going to move on to Syria. Both of you have mentioned that.\nTRUMP: She said a lot of things that were false. I mean, I think we should be allowed to maybe...\nRADDATZ: No, we can—no, Mr. Trump, we're going to go on. This is about the audience.\nTRUMP: Excuse me. Because she has been a disaster as a senator. A disaster.\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, we're going to move on. The heart-breaking video of a 5-year-old Syrian boy named Omran sitting in an ambulance after being pulled from the rubble after an air strike in Aleppo focused the world's attention on the horrors of the war in Syria, with 136 million views on Facebook alone.\nBut there are much worse images coming out of Aleppo every day now, where in the past few weeks alone, 400 people have been killed, at least 100 of them children. Just days ago, the State Department called for a war crimes investigation of the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad and its ally, Russia, for their bombardment of Aleppo.\nSo this next question comes through social media through Facebook. Diane from Pennsylvania asks, if you were president, what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo? Isn't it a lot like the Holocaust when the U.S. waited too long before we helped? Secretary Clinton, we will begin with your two minutes.\nCLINTON: Well, the situation in Syria is catastrophic. And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left. And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime.\nRussia hasn't paid any attention to ISIS. They're interested in keeping Assad in power. So I, when I was secretary of state, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones. We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them. And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground.\nBut I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia. Russia has decided that it's all in, in Syria. And they've also decided who they want to see become president of the United States, too, and it's not me. I've stood up to Russia. I've taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president.\nI think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, that's fine. And I did as secretary of state. That's how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons. It's how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot. So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now. But I do support the effort to investigate for crimes, war crimes committed by the Syrians and the Russians and try to hold them accountable.\nRADDATZ: Thank you, Secretary Clinton. Mr. Trump?\nTRUMP: First of all, she was there as secretary of state with the so-called line in the sand, which...\nCLINTON: No, I wasn't. I was gone. I hate to interrupt you, but at some point...\nTRUMP: OK. But you were in contact—excuse me. You were...\nCLINTON: At some point, we need to do some fact-checking here.\nTRUMP: You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you. I don't think he would be listening to you very much anymore.\nObama draws the line in the sand. It was laughed at all over the world what happened.\nNow, with that being said, she talks tough against Russia. But our nuclear program has fallen way behind, and they've gone wild with their nuclear program. Not good. Our government shouldn't have allowed that to happen. Russia is new in terms of nuclear. We are old. We're tired. We're exhausted in terms of nuclear. A very bad thing.\nNow, she talks tough, she talks really tough against Putin and against Assad. She talks in favor of the rebels. She doesn't even know who the rebels are. You know, every time we take rebels, whether it's in Iraq or anywhere else, we're arming people. And you know what happens? They end up being worse than the people.\nLook at what she did in Libya with Gadhafi. Gadhafi's out. It's a mess. And, by the way, ISIS has a good chunk of their oil. I'm sure you probably have heard that. It was a disaster. Because the fact is, almost everything she's done in foreign policy has been a mistake and it's been a disaster.\nBut if you look at Russia, just take a look at Russia, and look at what they did this week, where I agree, she wasn't there, but possibly she's consulted. We sign a peace treaty. Everyone's all excited. Well, what Russia did with Assad and, by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps I've ever seen in the history of deal-making, the Iran deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough to fill up this room.\nBut look at that deal. Iran now and Russia are now against us. So she wants to fight. She wants to fight for rebels. There's only one problem. You don't even know who the rebels are. So what's the purpose?\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, your two minutes is up.\nTRUMP: And one thing I have to say.\nRADDATZ: Your two minutes is up.\nTRUMP: I don't like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS. Russia is killing ISIS. And Iran is killing ISIS. And those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy.\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, let me repeat the question. If you were president...[laughter]...what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo? And I want to remind you what your running mate said. He said provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength and that if Russia continues to be involved in air strikes along with the Syrian government forces of Assad, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike the military targets of the Assad regime.\nTRUMP: OK. He and I haven't spoken, and I disagree. I disagree.\nRADDATZ: You disagree with your running mate?\nTRUMP: I think you have to knock out ISIS. Right now, Syria is fighting ISIS. We have people that want to fight both at the same time. But Syria is no longer Syria. Syria is Russia and it's Iran, who she made strong and Kerry and Obama made into a very powerful nation and a very rich nation, very, very quickly, very, very quickly.\nI believe we have to get ISIS. We have to worry about ISIS before we can get too much more involved. She had a chance to do something with Syria. They had a chance. And that was the line. And she didn't.\nRADDATZ: What do you think will happen if Aleppo falls?\nTRUMP: I think Aleppo is a disaster, humanitarian-wise.\nRADDATZ: What do you think will happen if it falls?\nTRUMP: I think that it basically has fallen. OK? It basically has fallen. Let me tell you something. You take a look at Mosul. The biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have Mosul. They think a lot of the ISIS leaders are in Mosul. So we have announcements coming out of Washington and coming out of Iraq, we will be attacking Mosul in three weeks or four weeks.\nWell, all of these bad leaders from ISIS are leaving Mosul. Why can't they do it quietly? Why can't they do the attack, make it a sneak attack, and after the attack is made, inform the American public that we've knocked out the leaders, we've had a tremendous success? People leave. Why do they have to say we're going to be attacking Mosul within the next four to six weeks, which is what they're saying? How stupid is our country?\nRADDATZ: There are sometimes reasons the military does that. Psychological warfare.\nTRUMP: I can't think of any. I can't think of any. And I'm pretty good at it.\nRADDATZ: It might be to help get civilians out.\nTRUMP: And we have General Flynn. And we have—look, I have 200 generals and admirals who endorsed me. I have 21 Congressional Medal of Honor recipients who endorsed me. We talk about it all the time. They understand, why can't they do something secretively, where they go in and they knock out the leadership? How—why would these people stay there? I've been reading now...\nRADDATZ: Tell me what your strategy is.\nTRUMP: ... for weeks—I've been reading now for weeks about Mosul, that it's the harbor of where—you know, between Raqqa and Mosul, this is where they think the ISIS leaders are. Why would they be saying—they're not staying there anymore. They're gone. Because everybody's talking about how Iraq, which is us with our leadership, goes in to fight Mosul.\nNow, with these 200 admirals and generals, they can't believe it. All I say is this. General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what we're doing in the Middle East.\nRADDATZ: I'm going to go to Secretary Clinton. Secretary Clinton, you want Assad to go. You advocated arming rebels, but it looks like that may be too late for Aleppo. You talk about diplomatic efforts. Those have failed. Cease-fires have failed. Would you introduce the threat of U.S. military force beyond a no-fly zone against the Assad regime to back up diplomacy?\nCLINTON: I would not use American ground forces in Syria. I think that would be a very serious mistake. I don't think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force. I don't think that is a smart strategy.\nI do think the use of special forces, which we're using, the use of enablers and trainers in Iraq, which has had some positive effects, are very much in our interests, and so I do support what is happening, but let me just...\nRADDATZ: But what would you do differently than President Obama is doing?\nCLINTON: Well, Martha, I hope that by the time I—if I'm fortunate...\nTRUMP: Everything.\nCLINTON: I hope by the time I am president that we will have pushed ISIS out of Iraq. I do think that there is a good chance that we can take Mosul. And, you know, Donald says he knows more about ISIS than the generals. No, he doesn't.\nThere are a lot of very important planning going on, and some of it is to signal to the Sunnis in the area, as well as Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, that we all need to be in this. And that takes a lot of planning and preparation.\nI would go after Baghdadi. I would specifically target Baghdadi, because I think our targeting of Al Qaida leaders—and I was involved in a lot of those operations, highly classified ones—made a difference. So I think that could help.\nI would also consider arming the Kurds. The Kurds have been our best partners in Syria, as well as Iraq. And I know there's a lot of concern about that in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take Raqqa after pushing ISIS out of Iraq.\nRADDATZ: Thank you very much. We're going to move on...\nTRUMP: You know what's funny? She went over a minute over, and you don't stop her. When I go one second over, it's like a big deal.\nRADDATZ: You had many answers.\nTRUMP: It's really—it's really very interesting.\nCOOPER: We've got a question over here from James Carter. Mr. Carter?\nQUESTION: My question is, do you believe you can be a devoted president to all the people in the United States?\nCOOPER: That question begins for Mr. Trump.\nTRUMP: Absolutely. I mean, she calls our people deplorable, a large group, and irredeemable. I will be a president for all of our people. And I'll be a president that will turn our inner cities around and will give strength to people and will give economics to people and will bring jobs back.\nBecause NAFTA, signed by her husband, is perhaps the greatest disaster trade deal in the history of the world. Not in this country. It stripped us of manufacturing jobs. We lost our jobs. We lost our money. We lost our plants. It is a disaster. And now she wants to sign TPP, even though she says now she's for it. She called it the gold standard. And by the way, at the last debate, she lied, because it turned out that she did say the gold standard and she said she didn't say it. They actually said that she lied. OK? And she lied. But she's lied about a lot of things.\nI would be a president for all of the people, African-Americans, the inner cities. Devastating what's happening to our inner cities. She's been talking about it for years. As usual, she talks about it, nothing happens. She doesn't get it done.\nSame with the Latino Americans, the Hispanic Americans. The same exact thing. They talk, they don't get it done. You go into the inner cities and—you see it's 45 percent poverty. African- Americans now 45 percent poverty in the inner cities. The education is a disaster. Jobs are essentially nonexistent.\nI mean, it's—you know, and I've been saying at big speeches where I have 20,000 and 30,000 people, what do you have to lose? It can't get any worse. And she's been talking about the inner cities for 25 years. Nothing's going to ever happen.\nLet me tell you, if she's president of the United States, nothing's going to happen. It's just going to be talk. And all of her friends, the taxes we were talking about, and I would just get it by osmosis. She's not doing any me favors. But by doing all the others' favors, she's doing me favors.\nCOOPER: Mr. Trump, thank you.\nTRUMP: But I will tell you, she's all talk. It doesn't get done. All you have to do is take a look at her Senate run. Take a look at upstate New York.\nCOOPER: Your two minutes is up. Secretary Clinton, two minutes?\nTRUMP: It turned out to be a disaster.\nCOOPER: You have two minutes, Secretary Clinton.\nCLINTON: Well, 67 percent of the people voted to re-elect me when I ran for my second term, and I was very proud and very humbled by that.\nMr. Carter, I have tried my entire life to do what I can to support children and families. You know, right out of law school, I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund. And Donald talks a lot about, you know, the 30 years I've been in public service. I'm proud of that. You know, I started off as a young lawyer working against discrimination against African-American children in schools and in the criminal justice system. I worked to make sure that kids with disabilities could get a public education, something that I care very much about. I have worked with Latinos—one of my first jobs in politics was down in south Texas registering Latino citizens to be able to vote. So I have a deep devotion, to use your absolutely correct word, to making sure that an every American feels like he or she has a place in our country.\nAnd I think when you look at the letters that I get, a lot of people are worried that maybe they wouldn't have a place in Donald Trump's America. They write me, and one woman wrote me about her son, Felix. She adopted him from Ethiopia when he was a toddler. He's 10 years old now. This is the only one country he's ever known. And he listens to Donald on TV and he said to his mother one day, will he send me back to Ethiopia if he gets elected?\nYou know, children listen to what is being said. To go back to the very, very first question. And there's a lot of fear—in fact, teachers and parents are calling it the Trump effect. Bullying is up. A lot of people are feeling, you know, uneasy. A lot of kids are expressing their concerns.\nSo, first and foremost, I will do everything I can to reach out to everybody.\nCOOPER: Your time, Secretary Clinton.\nCLINTON: Democrats, Republicans, independents, people across our country. If you don't vote for me, I still want to be your president.\nCOOPER: Your two minutes is up.\nCLINTON: I want to be the best president I can be for every American.\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, your two minutes is up. I want to follow up on something that Donald Trump actually said to you, a comment you made last month. You said that half of Donald Trump's supporters are, quote, \"deplorables, racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic.\" You later said you regretted saying half. You didn't express regret for using the term \"deplorables.\" To Mr. Carter's question, how can you unite a country if you've written off tens of millions of Americans?\nCLINTON: Well, within hours I said that I was sorry about the way I talked about that, because my argument is not with his supporters. It's with him and with the hateful and divisive campaign that he has run, and the inciting of violence at his rallies, and the very brutal kinds of comments about not just women, but all Americans, all kinds of Americans.\nAnd what he has said about African-Americans and Latinos, about Muslims, about POWs, about immigrants, about people with disabilities, he's never apologized for. And so I do think that a lot of the tone and tenor that he has said—I'm proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran. We ran a campaign based on issues, not insults. And he is supporting me 100 percent.\nCOOPER: Thank you.\nCLINTON: Because we talked about what we wanted to do. We might have had some differences, and we had a lot of debates...\nCOOPER: Thank you, Secretary.\nTRUMP: ... but we believed that we could make the country better. And I was proud of that.\nCOOPER: I want to give you a minute to respond.\nTRUMP: We have a divided nation. We have a very divided nation. You look at Charlotte. You look at Baltimore. You look at the violence that's taking place in the inner cities, Chicago, you take a look at Washington, D.C.\nWe have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years. We have a divided nation, because people like her—and believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart. And when she said deplorables, she meant it. And when she said irredeemable, they're irredeemable, you didn't mention that, but when she said they're irredeemable, to me that might have been even worse.\nCOOPER: She said some of them are irredeemable.\nTRUMP: She's got tremendous—she's got tremendous hatred. And this country cannot take another four years of Barack Obama, and that's what you're getting with her.\nCOOPER: Mr. Trump, let me follow up with you. In 2008, you wrote in one of your books that the most important characteristic of a good leader is discipline. You said, if a leader doesn't have it, quote, \"he or she won't be one for very long.\" In the days after the first debate, you sent out a series of tweets from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m., including one that told people to check out a sex tape. Is that the discipline of a good leader?\nTRUMP: No, there wasn't check out a sex tape. It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout.\nCOOPER: You mentioned sex tape.\nTRUMP: By the way, just so you understand, when she said 3 o'clock in the morning, take a look at Benghazi. She said who is going to answer the call at 3 o'clock in the morning? Guess what? She didn't answer it, because when Ambassador Stevens...\nCOOPER: The question is, is that the discipline of a good leader?\nTRUMP: ... 600—wait a minute, Anderson, 600 times. Well, she said she was awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, and she also sent a tweet out at 3 o'clock in the morning, but I won't even mention that. But she said she'll be awake. Who's going—the famous thing, we're going to answer our call at 3 o'clock in the morning. Guess what happened? Ambassador Stevens—Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help. And the only one she talked to was Sidney Blumenthal, who's her friend and not a good guy, by the way. So, you know, she shouldn't be talking about that.\nNow, tweeting happens to be a modern day form of communication. I mean, you can like it or not like it. I have, between Facebook and Twitter, I have almost 25 million people. It's a very effective way of communication. So you can put it down, but it is a very effective form of communication. I'm not un-proud of it, to be honest with you.\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, does Mr. Trump have the discipline to be a good leader?\nCLINTON: No.\nTRUMP: I'm shocked to hear that. [laughter]\nCLINTON: Well, it's not only my opinion. It's the opinion of many others, national security experts, Republicans, former Republican members of Congress. But it's in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is, and it's not just because I watched my husband take a $300 billion deficit and turn it into a $200 billion surplus, and 23 million new jobs were created, and incomes went up for everybody. Everybody. African-American incomes went up 33 percent.\nAnd it's not just because I worked with George W. Bush after 9/11, and I was very proud that when I told him what the city needed, what we needed to recover, he said you've got it, and he never wavered. He stuck with me.\nAnd I have worked and I admire President Obama. He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. That was a terrible time for our country.\nCOOPER: We have to move along.\nCLINTON: Nine million people lost their jobs.\nRADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, we have to...\nCLINTON: Five million homes were lost.\nRADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, we're moving.\nCLINTON: And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out. We are back on the right track. He would send us back into recession with his tax plans that benefit the wealthiest of Americans.\nRADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, we are moving to an audience question. We're almost out of time. We have another...\nTRUMP: We have the slowest growth since 1929.\nRADDATZ: We're moving to an audience question.\nTRUMP: It is—our country has the slowest growth and jobs are a disaster.\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton, we want to get to the audience. Thank you very much both of you. [laughter]\nWe have another audience question. Beth Miller has a question for both candidates.\nQUESTION: Good evening. Perhaps the most important aspect of this election is the Supreme Court justice. What would you prioritize as the most important aspect of selecting a Supreme Court justice?\nRADDATZ: We begin with your two minutes, Secretary Clinton.\nCLINTON: Thank you. Well, you're right. This is one of the most important issues in this election. I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but, you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against.\nBecause I think the current court has gone in the wrong direction. And so I would want to see the Supreme Court reverse Citizens United and get dark, unaccountable money out of our politics. Donald doesn't agree with that.\nI would like the Supreme Court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country, that we don't always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise. I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade and a woman's right to choose, and I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality.\nNow, Donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider. And among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse Roe v. Wade and reverse marriage equality. I think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards.\nI want a Supreme Court that doesn't always side with corporate interests. I want a Supreme Court that understands because you're wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn't mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else.\nSo I have very clear views about what I want to see to kind of change the balance on the Supreme Court. And I regret deeply that the Senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that President Obama, a highly qualified person, they've not given him a vote to be able to be have the full complement of nine Supreme Court justices. I think that was a dereliction of duty.\nI hope that they will see their way to doing it, but if I am so fortunate enough as to be president, I will immediately move to make sure that we fill that, we have nine justices that get to work on behalf of our people.\nRADDATZ: Thank you, Secretary Clinton. Thank you. You're out of time. Mr. Trump?\nTRUMP: Justice Scalia, great judge, died recently. And we have a vacancy. I am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia. I'm looking for judges—and I've actually picked 20 of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody.\nBut people that will respect the Constitution of the United States. And I think that this is so important. Also, the Second Amendment, which is totally under siege by people like Hillary Clinton. They'll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for, what it represents. So important to me.\nNow, Hillary mentioned something about contributions just so you understand. So I will have in my race more than $100 million put in—of my money, meaning I'm not taking all of this big money from all of these different corporations like she's doing. What I ask is this.\nSo I'm putting in more than—by the time it's finished, I'll have more than $100 million invested. Pretty much self-funding money. We're raising money for the Republican Party, and we're doing tremendously on the small donations, $61 average or so.\nI ask Hillary, why doesn't—she made $250 million by being in office. She used the power of her office to make a lot of money. Why isn't she funding, not for $100 million, but why don't you put $10 million or $20 million or $25 million or $30 million into your own campaign?\nIt's $30 million less for special interests that will tell you exactly what to do and it would really, I think, be a nice sign to the American public. Why aren't you putting some money in? You have a lot of it. You've made a lot of it because of the fact that you've been in office. Made a lot of it while you were secretary of state, actually. So why aren't you putting money into your own campaign? I'm just curious.\nCLINTON: Well...[crosstalk]\nRADDATZ: Thank you very much. We're going to get on to one more question.\nCLINTON: The question was about the Supreme Court. And I just want to quickly say, I respect the Second Amendment. But I believe there should be comprehensive background checks, and we should close the gun show loophole, and close the online loophole.\nCOOPER: Thank you.\nRADDATZ: We have—we have one more question, Mrs. Clinton.\nCLINTON: We have to save as many lives as we possibly can.\nCOOPER: We have one more question from Ken Bone about energy policy. Ken?\nQUESTION: What steps will your energy policy take to meet our energy needs, while at the same time remaining environmentally friendly and minimizing job loss for fossil power plant workers?\nCOOPER: Mr. Trump, two minutes?\nTRUMP: Absolutely. I think it's such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration. Under absolutely siege. The EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, is killing these energy companies. And foreign companies are now coming in buying our—buying so many of our different plants and then re-jiggering the plant so that they can take care of their oil.\nWe are killing—absolutely killing our energy business in this country. Now, I'm all for alternative forms of energy, including wind, including solar, et cetera. But we need much more than wind and solar.\nAnd you look at our miners. Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business. There is a thing called clean coal. Coal will last for 1,000 years in this country. Now we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology. We have unbelievable—we have found over the last seven years, we have found tremendous wealth right under our feet. So good. Especially when you have $20 trillion in debt.\nI will bring our energy companies back. They'll be able to compete. They'll make money. They'll pay off our national debt. They'll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous. But we are putting our energy companies out of business. We have to bring back our workers.\nYou take a look at what's happening to steel and the cost of steel and China dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies. We have to guard our energy companies. We have to make it possible.\nThe EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business. And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they're doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business. It's a disgrace.\nCOOPER: Your time is up. Thank you.\nTRUMP: It's an absolute disgrace.\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton, two minutes.\nCLINTON: And actually—well, that was very interesting. First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business. That's something that I fought against as a senator and that I would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don't get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else.\nYou know, because it sounds like you're in the business or you're aware of people in the business—you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent. We are not dependent upon the Middle East. But the Middle East still controls a lot of the prices. So the price of oil has been way down. And that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies, right? We are, however, producing a lot of natural gas, which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels. And I think that's an important transition.\nWe've got to remain energy-independent. It gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the Middle East. We have enough worries over there without having to worry about that.\nSo I have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because I think that is a serious problem. And I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses.\nBut I also want to be sure that we don't leave people behind. That's why I'm the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country, because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers, they dug that coal out. A lot of them lost their lives. They were injured, but they turned the lights on and they powered their factories. I don't want to walk away from them. So we've got to do something for them.\nCOOPER: Secretary Clinton...\nCLINTON: But the price of coal is down worldwide. So we have to look at this comprehensively.\nCOOPER: Your time is up.\nCLINTON: And that's exactly what I have proposed. I hope you will go to HillaryClinton.com and look at my entire policy.\nCOOPER: Time is up. We have time for one more...\nRADDATZ: We have...\nCOOPER: One more audience question.\nRADDATZ: We've sneaked in one more question, and it comes from Karl Becker.\nQUESTION: Good evening. My question to both of you is, regardless of the current rhetoric, would either of you name one positive thing that you respect in one another? [applause]\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump, would you like to go first?\nCLINTON: Well, I certainly will, because I think that's a very fair and important question. Look, I respect his children. His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald. I don't agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that. And I think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me.\nSo I believe that this election has become in part so—so conflict-oriented, so intense because there's a lot at stake. This is not an ordinary time, and this is not an ordinary election. We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the Supreme Court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake. It's one of the most consequential elections that we've had.\nAnd that's why I've tried to put forth specific policies and plans, trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is I want to do as president. And that's why I hope people will check on that for themselves so that they can see that, yes, I've spent 30 years, actually maybe a little more, working to help kids and families. And I want to take all that experience to the White House and do that every single day.\nRADDATZ: Mr. Trump?\nTRUMP: Well, I consider her statement about my children to be a very nice compliment. I don't know if it was meant to be a compliment, but it is a great—I'm very proud of my children. And they've done a wonderful job, and they've been wonderful, wonderful kids. So I consider that a compliment.\nI will say this about Hillary. She doesn't quit. She doesn't give up. I respect that. I tell it like it is. She's a fighter. I disagree with much of what she's fighting for. I do disagree with her judgment in many cases. But she does fight hard, and she doesn't quit, and she doesn't give up. And I consider that to be a very good trait.\nRADDATZ: Thanks to both of you.\nCOOPER: We want to thank both the candidates. We want to thank the university here. This concludes the town hall meeting. Our thanks to the candidates, the commission, Washington University, and to everybody who watched.\nRADDATZ: Please tune in on October 19th for the final presidential debate that will take place at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

And it is always good to be friends—to be with friends with so many people here who, as I look out across the room, have been there from the start, have been there from the beginning. And so Michelle wants me to say hello. She loves you. It was great to be in our house, sleeping in our own bed. We were a little disoriented because the Cubs look like they might win the World Series. I noticed a bunch of my staff headed towards the North Side pretty early last night.\nHurricane Matthew\nBefore I get started, I just want to mention—because sometimes things get lost in the swirl—we all know that there's been a really serious hurricane down in Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia. People were hit. They weren't hit as directly as we had feared, but it has left a lot of devastation in its wake. Lives have been lost. Property has been severely damaged. And there's still continuing risk of flooding going on.\nI've been in touch with the Governors of the affected States, and my team has been working to make sure that they're getting the resources that they need from the Federal Government. And even as TV cameras move on to the next story, we're going to be right where—with the people in need, to make sure that they're getting all the help they deserve. So for the folks in Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia: The American people are with you in this time of need, and we're just going to keep on working to make sure that as the waters recede, that you're able to rebuild. And we're going to do everything that we have to do to make sure that we've got your back.\n2016 Presidential and Congressional Elections\nNow, before I do anything else, I also want to thank the hosts of this evening. First of all, John and Bonnie Atkinson, thank you. Marty Nesbitt and Anita Blanchard, thank you. And, Theaster Gates, thank you for your incredible hospitality and this great facility.\nA couple other people I want to acknowledge. Dick Durbin in the house. Congresswoman Cheri Bustos is here. Robin Kelly is here. We love Robin. Tammy Duckworth, I'm going to talk a lot about her later. [Laughter] Just a couple other people I see in the audience. Running Statewide, Susana Mendoza, is here. Where's Susana? We served together. She was in the House; I was in the Senate. And, of course, the ageless secretary of state, Jesse White, in the house. And when I was a senator, my State representative, Barbara Flynn Currie. I'm sure I missed a couple of people. It's not because I don't love you. It's because I'm getting old and it's dark here, so I can't see everything. [Laughter]\nYou may have noticed that when I got here on Friday, I was doing an event for the D-triple-C, and then I thought it would be a good time to just go ahead and vote. I'm not going to tell you who I voted for. It's private. [Laughter] You can probably guess. But here in Illinois, we're luckier than most. We don't just have one extraordinary candidate, we've got two extraordinary candidates at the top of the ballot. And I'm proud to call them both friends. Our next President, Hillary Clinton, and our next Senator, Tammy Duckworth!\nAnd I've had the pleasure of knowing Tammy for a long time. I could not be happier that she's running for my old Senate seat, because I loved being your Senator; it was a great job. I got to spend time traveling across this great State: small towns, farmlands, the world's greatest city. And what I always explain to people is, Illinois is a microcosm of the country. More representative than any other State of the broad diversity of America. It's a place where Democrats and Republicans and Independents and people of good will of all races and faiths share certain bedrock values. If you rank 50 States across the categories of age and education, household income, race, religion, then the Land of Lincoln is the best mirror for who we are.\nAnd I also learned that if you're willing to listen, it's possible to bridge a lot of differences. I learned that most folks know that issues are complicated and they're not solved by sound bites; that there's a need for both idealism and practicality; that you have to be able to be bold, but not reckless, and take responsibility. We know what can and cannot be compromised and even admit occasionally that the other side has a point.\nAnd that's what convinced me in part to run nationally, because I believed that if you could take some of that wisdom and apply it to our national politics——\n[At this point, a cellular phone rang.]\nThe President. Uh-oh. Is somebody calling? [Laughter] That's so embarrassing. [Laughter] That's all right. Where was I? [Laughter]\nThe notion was, is that if we could apply that same common sense and that same sensibility, the belief that we're all in this together—that we're not enemies, we're on the same team; we have differences, but those differences should and can and must be bridged—if we can apply that at the national level, then it would make an enormous difference. That's what led me to run for President. That's the vision that's guided me as your President. And I'm here to tell you that that's the vision that Tammy Duckworth shares. That's why all of you have to do everything you can to make sure that we send this outstanding Member of Congress to the United States Senate.\nLook, all of you know Tammy's amazing story. She's the daughter of a veteran and the daughter of an immigrant. She was a war hero who lost both of her legs when a rocket-propelled grenade struck the Black Hawk helicopter that she was piloting in Iraq. But she never stopped serving her country after she got home. She is a tireless advocate on behalf of her fellow veterans. She's a working mom, a champion for the middle class. She's a tough lady, but with a big heart. And she is going to be a great Senator for Illinois.\nI cannot think of a better person to represent this State that I love. And I know that it's a cliché to say that every 4 years, that this is the most important election in your lifetimes. This is the most important election though. [Laughter]\nThink about where we came from and the road that we've traveled. Eight years ago, we were spiraling into the worst financial crisis and economic crisis the world had seen since the Great Depression, in the midst of two wars. Regard for the United States around the world was sinking precipitously. And together, we fought our way back: cutting unemployment in half; helping our businesses create more than 15 million new jobs; slashing our dependence on foreign oil; doubling our production of renewable energy; reducing the deficit by almost two-thirds; getting income rising again, poverty falling again; covering another 20 million Americans with health insurance so that we're cutting our uninsured rate to an alltime low. Bin Laden is gone. Marriage equality is a reality from coast to coast.\nThe work that we've been able to produce, even with all the obstruction, has been remarkable. But I'm telling you right now, all that progress is at stake in this election. We should be building on that success and creating even more progress. But if we don't do our jobs in this election, it could all be wiped away.\nSo we've got to elect leaders who are going to keep building an economy that works for everybody, not just for those at the top, but for folks at the bottom who are struggling to get into the middle class, and a middle class that's been hard pressed and is just now starting to see their wages and incomes grow. That's what Tammy believes in: an America that says, no matter who you are, where you come from, what you look like, what kind of disability you may have, what faith you are—if you work hard, you should be able to get ahead here in the United States of America.\nSo when it comes to students, Tammy and I have a plan to make community college tuition free, if you're willing to work for it. She's fighting to help people refinance student—their student loans, expand Pell grants, make sure that there's not a striving young student out there that feels that finances are preventing them from being able to achieve their dreams.\nWhen it comes to veterans, I don't have to tell you Tammy is a passionate advocate with a record to match, because she knows what it means for our veterans to have the kinds of services that they have earned and the way that they can serve America even after they've put away the uniform. That's why I chose her to serve as my Assistant Secretary of the VA, where she helped to cut homeless veteran—the number of homeless veterans in half. In Congress, she worked to put more vets back to work, to protect servicemembers from predatory lending. And with Tammy by my side, I was proud to sign the Clay Hunt SAV Act to improve mental health care for our returning heroes. That is saving lives right now, and that's because of Tammy.\nWhen it comes to seniors, Tammy has got a plan to make sure that Social Security benefits keep up with the cost of living. She'll pay for it in a responsible way by closing tax loopholes that benefit folks who, frankly, don't need another tax loophole. She's going to work to make sure that all Americans can enjoy security in their retirement.\nAnd when it comes to improving relations between law enforcement and communities they serve—something that obviously is of great importance here—Tammy is working for comprehensive criminal justice reform that will make a difference. Everything from funding body cameras for cops to forgiving the loans of law graduates who serve their communities as prosecutors or public defenders. And she's going to invest in creating more jobs and opportunities for all of our young people. And I'm going to be working alongside her even after I'm finished being President to make sure that we're bringing those opportunities to all of Chicago, because our young people deserve it.\nSo that's what Tammy believes in. Don't let anybody tell you there's not a clear choice in this election. Tammy's opponent said no to free community college. He said no to allowing students to refinance their student loans. He's been silent on expanding overtime pay for hard-working Americans. Now, he has said \"yes,\" but it was to turning Medicare into a voucher program. So that's the wrong answer. You should be saying no to that. His plan for the economy gives more tax cuts to the wealthiest among us and to companies that are shipping jobs overseas, while slashing investments in education, health care, infrastructure—all the things that would help us have a broad-based growth economy. Do you really think that he'd be a check on somebody like the guy running for President at the top of the Republican ticket? That he would be saying \"no\" to him? Are we really going to risk giving Donald Trump the majority he needs to roll back all the progress that we've made over the last 8 years? I don't think so.\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. No. [Laughter]\nOne of the most disturbing things about this election is just the unbelievable rhetoric coming at the top of the Republican ticket. I don't need to repeat it there are children in the room. [Laughter] But demeaning women, degrading women, but also minorities, immigrants, people of other faiths; mocking the disabled; insulting our troops, insulting our veterans.\nThat tells you a couple things. It tells you that he's insecure enough that he pumps himself up by putting other people down. [Laughter] Not a character trait that I would advise for somebody in the Oval Office. [Laughter] It tells you that he doesn't care much about the basic values that we try to impart to our kids. It tells you he'd be careless with the civility and the respect that a real, vibrant democracy requires. And it sure as heck tells you he's never met somebody as tough or smart or patriotic as Tammy Duckworth. If you want to see leadership, that's the kind of leadership that you've got to look for.\nSo the bottom line is this: If you want to send a message in this election, then you've got to vote for Hillary Clinton, and you've got to vote for Tammy Duckworth. If you want leaders who actually respect Americans and value hard work; if you want higher wages, better benefits, a fairer Tax Code, a bigger voice for workers, equal pay for equal work, stronger regulations on Wall Street—then you should vote for Hillary Clinton and Tammy Duckworth.\nIf you want a better kind of politics for our Nation; if you want common sense and a commitment to facts and reason and a belief that here in America, we're stronger together—then you've got to vote for Hillary Clinton, and you have to vote for Tammy Duckworth.\nAnd all of that is going to require you. You're going to have to work. You can't take it for granted. Too much is at stake to get lazy or take it for granted right now. We've got to hustle. We've got to work. We've got to fight for it. So I'm asking all of you to join me. I'm asking all of you to work your hearts out. It's only 30 days. Work hard. Get out there. But if you're willing to work hard with me, with Michelle—and by the way, if you don't work hard, Michelle might, you know—[laughter]—you don't want to mess up with Michelle, I know. If you're willing to do this for me, then I am absolutely confident that not only are we going to win an election, but more importantly, we're going to send a message to our kids about who we are. We're going to reaffirm what this country is about.\nLook, one thing I've learned over the last 8 years is, a lot of problems are hard, and progress is rarely overnight, even in the great victories that we've had, like passing health care legislation that is improving the lives and saving lives of people right now. It's a grind. And you've got to battle it out. And whatever policies you put in place, they're not going to be absolutely perfect, and then you've got to tweak them and continue to work to expand and make them work even better. When you look at issues like climate change, you know that there's going to be—for every two steps forward that we take, there are going to be some folks who want to block progress. There's too much money in politics. We know that the lobbyists and special interests are still going to be having a big impact out there. So democracy is not easy. It requires citizens who believe deeply that this form of government, the idea that we all have a voice and that we listen to each other and engage each other and we argue, but we don't demonize each other—that out of that process comes something better—it requires work; it requires commitment. It's the kind of service that Tammy Duckworth understands. She's made the kinds of sacrifices that most of us can't imagine. And the kinds of sacrifices she and her family are now making aren't as obvious, but they're just as meaningful, because ultimately, what she does is to show us what real patriotism means. She's showing us what true love of country means.\nAnd for her to succeed, for Hillary to succeed, it's not enough just to mark a ballot box, although that's important. We're going to have to make sure that we've got their back every step of the way. And I can tell you, this has been the honor of my life serving as President. I am very much looking forward to life as a private citizen. [Laughter] But I will still be a citizen, and I will still have obligations. And I am going to be working just as hard, after a sizeable break and a lot of sleep—[laughter]—to make sure that we leave to the next generation the same kind of incredible inheritance that we received from our parents and our grandparents.\nSo let's get busy, everybody. Are you fired up?\nAudience members. Yes!\nThe President. Are you ready to go? Thank you, Chicago. I love you. Thank you, Tammy Duckworth!", "timestamp": "2016-10-09", "title": "Remarks at a Fundraiser for Senatorial Candidate L. Tammy Duckworth in Chicago, Illinois"}

{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "note": "Speech as delivered. This was Secretary Clinton's largest rally to date, with about 18,500 people attending.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119155", "text": "\"It is a glorious night here at the university, in Columbus, in the great state of Ohio. And I am thrilled to be here with all of you. And I want to thank Tony for his introduction. He made the greatest case against my opponent, didn't he? Thank you, Tony. And thanks to Mayor Ginther and Congresswoman Beatty and to my great friend, your former governor, and with your help, the next senator, Ted Strickland.\nAny of you see that debate last night? I'll tell you what, I'm not sure you'll ever see anything like that again. At least I hope you won't. It was such a clear display of what's at stake in this election. And I am thrilled to have the chance to talk with all of you about what we can do together, because I truly believe we are stronger together. To move our country forward.\nNow, the one thing I thought about last night and said was, as I was standing there on the stage with my opponent, was to remember what Michelle Obama had said. To paraphrase her, one of us went low and one of us went high. I want you to understand, I want to be a president for all Americans. I think the American dream is big enough for everybody. And I am honored to have support, not just from Democrats, but from independents and Republicans, because we've got to pull this country together if we're going to move into the future together, creating what we need for ourselves and our children.\nNow, I got to tell you, tomorrow is a big day in Ohio for this election because tomorrow, October 11th, is the last day to register in Ohio. And I hope every one of you will take your phones out, go to iwillvote.com, to confirm that you are registered. Because we want everybody to vote and we particularly want young people to vote because this is your election more than anybody else's.\nWhen I think about the challenges that we're facing, I don't think any one person has all the answers. I think we have to listen to each other and respect each other and celebrate our diversity, because that makes us smarter as well as stronger.\nDonald Trump spent his time last night attacking me when he should have been apologizing. We all heard on that tape what he thinks of women and how he treats women. And last night he doubled down on his excuse, saying that, well, it's just locker room banter. You know what's happened today, which is so interesting, is that a lot of athletes and coaches from the NBA, from Major League Baseball, from the NFL and more, have been coming forward, tweeting, they've been saying, no, that's not what happens in our locker rooms. And I just happen to think that our athletes and our coaches know a lot more about what happens in locker rooms than Donald Trump does.\nBut it wasn't just this one video that was so disturbing, even shocking. We have seen this kind of behavior throughout this entire campaign, and it's not just about women. Yes, he's insulted and demeaned women; we've seen it over and over again. But he has targeted others as well. He's disrespected and denigrated African Americans and Latinos, Muslims and POWs, people with disabilities and immigrants. He is an equal-opportunity insulter if there ever was one.\nThat is not what we are in America. And it may be who he is, but this election is our chance to show who we are. We are better than that. We are bigger than that. And I want to send a message to every boy and girl, every man and woman in our country, indeed, to the entire world, that that is not who America is. And we can do that by making sure that we turn out in the biggest numbers ever. Some analysts are saying we may have the biggest presidential election than we've had in a really long time. And the main reason is because your generation, the young people of America, are the most tolerant, open and generous generation in American history.\nYou know what's at stake, but you also know what you believe. And you don't want someone who says that he's going to appoint Supreme Court justices who will reverse marriage equality; who will – who will keep Citizens United, one of the worst decisions ever made, that allowed dark, unaccountable money in our electoral system; that will reverse a woman's right to make her own health care decisions; who will defund Planned Parenthood. You know better than that. You are helping us move toward a more perfect union. That has been the story of America at our best. We keep widening the circle of opportunity and inviting more people in. If you're willing to do your part, you're willing to make your contribution, there is a place for you in this nation of ours.\nWe don't have to make America great. We've got to do what we can to make sure it remains great and it becomes greater because we keep broadening that circle of opportunity.\nAnd please, never forget America is great because America is good, and if we deviate, if we deviate from our fundamental values – and that's indeed the kind of campaign my opponent has run. He has said he would order our men and women in uniform to commit war crimes. He has said he would impose a religious test on who could come into our country – a nation founded on religious freedom and liberty. This is turning the clock back, not just a few years, but centuries. The only way to rebuke this is to vote. Use the single most important, fundamental right you have as citizens of America.\nAnd when you do, I want you to know what you're voting for, because I don't want you just to vote against something. I want you to vote for something. And here's what we're going to do.\nI believe our economy should work for everyone, not just those at the top. So I am ending this campaign the way I started my career all those years ago when I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund. As soon as I got out of law school, I said, I don't want to do anything else other than work hard and advocate for kids and families. So I was fortunate to have the chance to be really on the front lines of a lot of change, helping to get the law that enabled people, kids with disabilities, to go to school. Now, most of you may not have any reason to remember this because you weren't born, but – there was a time in our country not so long ago when if you had a disability, if you lived in a school district, there was no requirement that they make accommodations for you. And literally millions of kids were denied an education. I went door to door getting information about what was going on with these children so that I could contribute a report to a big national effort to go to the Congress and say, this is wrong – in America, we're better than this. Open the doors of our schools to kids with disabilities.\nAnd then I was privileged to work to make sure that we got young people out of adult jails and prisons where they had no reason to be in the first place.\nSo when Donald Trump talks about what I've been doing for the last 30 years, I welcome that. I welcome it because in the 1970s, I was working to end discrimination and he was being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination against people in his apartments. And in the 1980s, I was working to improve the schools in Arkansas to make sure that teachers were well paid and that the coursework was going to prepare kids for the future, while he was getting a loan for $14 million from his father to start a business. And in the 1990s, I went to the UN Conference on Women and said women's rights are human rights – while he was insulting Miss Universe, Alicia Machado. And on the day – on the day that I was in the Situation Room watching the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice, he was hosting Celebrity Apprentice. So if he wants to talk about what we have been doing the last 30 years, bring it on.\nSo we've got to make up our minds about what kind of economy we want. And I'm pretty clear about that. I think we want new jobs with rising incomes. And I want us to have the biggest new jobs effort since the end of World War II. And I have some specific ideas in mind. We are going to have a big investment in infrastructure: our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports, our water systems. They need to be upgraded and maintained and built. That is a question of competitiveness. We have to have a competitive economy. Our airports are so rundown we don't even have one airport in our entire country in the top 25 in the world because we're not using the newest technology. We're not really prepared to do what we need to to invest in you and invest in those new jobs.\nI do want to bring advanced manufacturing. I heard Ted Strickland talking about that. I think we can have a manufacturing renaissance. There is no reason that we cannot own new manufacturing. I'm not interested in a race to the bottom, in competing for low-wage jobs. I am interested in competing for the high-wage jobs. So let's lead in precision machining, 3D printing.\nAnd let's be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. Some nation's going to have that title. I think it's either going to be Germany or China or us. It should be us. No question it should be. We're going to fight climate change. And we're going to lead the world in fulfilling the requirements of the Paris agreement.\nI'm running against somebody who doesn't believe in climate change or at least he says he doesn't , who has even said he thinks it's a hoax created by the Chinese. Well, right now the Chinese have twice as much renewable energy as we do. So maybe they think it's a hoax, but they're investing. And they're creating. And they're going to want to export. And what a shame it would be. We have innovated. We have made the technology that could bring us into the forefront of this. And we're going to do it.\nWhen I am president, I want all of you who care about science, technology, engineering, mathematics, I want you to be part of it. And while we are growing the economy, we are going to make it fairer. We are going to raise the national minimum wage because no one who works full-time should be left in poverty. And don't you think it is finally time to guarantee equal pay for women's work?\nYou know, back in the spring, I was at a town hall in Las Vegas. And the little girl raised her hand. And I called on her. And she said to me, 'If you're elected president, does a girl president make the same as a boy president?'\nI said, \"Well, that's one of those jobs where they have to publish what you make.\" So we're going to have more transparency so people have more incentive to make sure that everybody is treated fairly.\nAnd I'll tell you something else. I want to do more to promote profit-sharing. If you help to make the profits, it shouldn't all just go to the executives and the shareholders. You should be able to share in that.\nNow, there's a lot we can do. And people say, 'Well, how are you going to pay for it?' Well, I'm going to go where the money is. And all the money is going to the wealthiest in our country. I have made a pledge, and you can hold me to it. I will not raise taxes on the middle class. Nobody who is working hard to get ahead should be asked to pay more in taxes when we have so many people who have done so well and are not paying their fair share.\nNow, Donald Trump is the poster child for this. Last night he finally admitted he hasn't paid a dime in federal income tax for years. Now, he claims that's because back in the early 1990s, he apparently lost a billion dollars running casinos. Who loses money running casinos? Really. Now, one of his supporters said, 'Well, the fact that he lost a billion dollars and that meant he didn't have to pay taxes made him a genius.' Well, I guess you do have to be a genius to lose a billion dollars in a year. But I'll tell you what. What that meant was he paid zero, zero for the military, zero for our vets, zero for Pell Grants to help a lot of you afford college and get through college.\nAnd then he did something that, in retrospect, seemed both odd and not very smart. He brought in Warren Buffett. He said, 'Well, everybody does this. Warren Buffett does this.'\nSo Warren Buffett, who, by the way, is a real billionaire, Warren Buffett, heard that, pretty hard to miss. And so he put out a statement today. And here's what he said. He said, 'I have paid federal income tax every year since 1944, when I was 13.' He said, 'I have copies of all 72 of my returns. And none uses a carryforward.' That was the gimmick Trump used to avoid paying his fair share. And then Warren Buffett ends by saying, 'Finally, I have been audited by the IRS multiple times and am currently being audited. I have no problem releasing my tax information while under audit.' 'Neither would Mr. Trump. At least he would have no legal problem in doing so.' Well, if you take a shot at Warren Buffett, you'd better be prepared.\nAnd in fact, Warren Buffett actually agrees with me that wealthy people ought to pay more. He says no person in his fortunate position in life should be paying a lower tax rate than people who work for him. And he has proposed what's called the Buffett rule, and I am absolutely behind that, and I've said that's one of the changes I want – so that the wealthy have to pay their fair share.\nNow, there was a lot about last night that was hard to believe. And so, don't. But one of the things that really struck me was he had not answer. You know, he's not usually tongue-tied, but he had no answer when confronted about the report that he's been buying cheap Chinese steel for his construction projects instead of American-made steel that supports good American jobs. Now, I know you've seen reports and you've probably seen a lot of the visuals coming out of his rallies. He's had a lot of them across Ohio. He claims to be on the side of workers. He especially likes to talk about how he supports American steelworkers. He even had the nerve – this is what kills me about him – he even had the nerve to brag about how American steel will send new skyscrapers soaring. And the whole time he was hiding the truth. Hiding the fact that he chose to buy illegally-dumped Chinese steel instead of American steel.\nYou know, when China illegally floods our market with steel at below-price, and people like Trump buy it, that kills jobs. It kills jobs in this state, including right here in Columbus. This May, Columbus Castings, the biggest single-site foundry in America, just seven miles from where we are tonight, filed for bankruptcy and announced that 800 workers would be laid off. Now, when I think of that and I think of the way Trump has been playing people, it really – it really gets me upset. There's no justification for it. But it fits him to a T. For all his talk about putting America first, he's made his products in at least 12 other countries. Trump's suits and ties were made in Mexico and China. They could have been made right here in Ohio. In fact, he could have made his ties three miles from the Trump Tower in New York.\nSo we've got to figure out how we have an economy that really does produce growth and rewards companies that do the right thing. And that for me means we need to have a tax system that rewards investment in our country, investment in workers, investment in plant and equipment, investment in research and development, and give the good guys a chance to get ahead instead of being taken advantage of by Wall Street and others.\nWe are going to end the cowboy culture on Wall Street and what happens in too many boardrooms. We're going to defend the tough new rules on Wall Street that President Obama got passed, the Dodd-Frank rules. Trump wants to do away with those. He also wants to do away with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, something that was designed and created by my friend Senator Elizabeth Warren to protect consumers. He wants to do away with that. And yet he claims to be on the side of working people and the middle class.\nWell, we're going to crack down on corporate fraud, like we've seen at Wells Fargo. We're going to crack down to make sure that Wall Street can never wreck Main Street again. And we're going to do it in part by imposing some penalties on companies that try to pick up and leave America. If they try to leave, we're going to slap an exit tax on them and make them pay back every single penny they ever got in tax benefits from anybody in America.\nWe're also going to end the carried interest loophole. I've been trying to get that done for years. We're going to get it done. We've got a couple of different ways of doing it. I hope that Congress along with us, but if they don't, we're going to figure out a way to finally put an end to what is one of the most unfair parts of the whole tax code, hedge fund managers and others paying a lower tax rate, not for investing but just for moving money around. That's going to end. I want to reward the productive economy. I don't want to keep rewarding the financial economy. That is not the way we're going to grow new businesses, and create new opportunities and more jobs for Americans.\nNow, people in Ohio often ask about, 'Well, what are we going to do about trade?' Well, we're going to have smart and fair trade. That's what I love about your Senator, Sherrod Brown. He is one of the best advocates for the kind of trade deals we should have. Look. We've got to trade with the rest of the world. We're only 5 percent of the population of the world. We've got to trade with the other 95 percent. When I was Secretary of State, we really bore down on this, and we increased American exports 30 percent, and in particular, 50 percent to China, because we stood behind every American business. We helped them knock down every barrier so that they could get into those markets and sell.\nAnd I've gone toe-to-toe with the Chinese over trade. They have tried to slap unfair tariffs and prevent American companies from doing business without having to pay some kind of big fine or make some big deal. So we're going to stand up. I'm going to have a trade prosecutor who will report directly to me to make sure every trade deal we're already in is absolutely followed to the letter so nobody takes advantage of us.\nAnd I've always had three tests for trade deals: Does it create American jobs? Does it raise American incomes? is it good for our national security? And when it comes to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the TPP, it fails my tests. Once it was finally negotiated, I don't think it will do what I want it to do, so I oppose it. I oppose TPP now. I'll oppose it after the election. I'll oppose it as president. But I'm going to keep fighting to open markets so that we can get more jobs and rising incomes by exporting into those markets and doing business with the rest of the world.\nI also saw a sign or a t-shirt out here about Social Security. And that may not always be something that people on a great university campus think about, but I'll tell you what. I am never going to let anybody privatize Social Security. That is off the table forever.\nSo let's say yes to good jobs, but here's what else we need to say yes to. Let's say yes to good education from preschool all the way through college and university. I want every kid to be able to attend this great university to do well. And for a lot of kids, they're not prepared when they get to kindergarten and first grade. There's an achievement gap already. There's also a digital gap; we have five million homes, mostly poor homes, without access to the internet, so they're behind. I want this to be a true meritocracy. I'm tired of inequality. I want people to feel like they can get ahead if they work for it.\nSo I want to have universal pre-kindergarten so every child can be prepared to be successful. I want good schools and good teachers in every zip code so every child has the best possible public education. And I think we made a mistake when we took what used to be called vocational education out of high school. We need technical education for more young people. Not everybody needs to or wants to go to a four-year college, but everybody should have the opportunity to get the skills that he or she needs to get ahead and be successful. I want us to have our community colleges working with our high schools and our businesses. We have a lot of job openings for machinists and tool and die markers, for coders, for all kinds of skills.\nAnd then when it comes to college, I want everybody who goes to a public college or university to understand what I am proposing that is a joint proposal from Senator Sanders and myself. We both remember that college was affordable. And it isn't for a lot of people now, and a lot of states have disinvested in their great public colleges and universities. So here is our proposal.\nWe want anyone from a family that makes less than $125,000 a year to go to Ohio State University tuition-free. And for families over that line, we want you to go debt-free. So yes, you pay what you can afford, but you don't have to go into debt to go to Ohio State. And I'll tell you, the other big problem – how many of you already have student debt? Oh, wow. Practically every hand. Well, here's what we're going to do. We're going to make it possible for you to refinance that debt. If you can refinance your home mortgage, your car payment, or if Donald can refinance his airplane, you ought to be able to refinance your student debt.\nAnd then we want you to pay it back as a percentage of the income you make, and have a limit on that, 10 percent, so that – I feel personally about this because that's what I did after law school. My dad was a small businessman, and he really was a saver. He didn't even have a credit card. Didn't believe in that. So he saved the money for me to go to college. I had to work if I wanted to buy a book, but that was okay. That was the arrangement. And then I told him I wanted to go to law school. He said, 'You're on your own. I don't have any money for that.' So I worked, I got a small scholarship, and I took out loans. But boy, was I lucky, because I got into one of the earliest income repayment programs. In other words, when I got out of law school, I could go to work for the Children's Defense Fund and make, I don't know, $14,000 a year because I could pay it back as a percentage of my income, not on an interest rate of 8, 10, 12 percent like I see from young people across America.\nSo that's what I want, but I also want to make it possible, if you do public service or national service, to have a lot of your loan, and maybe all of it, forgiven because you're going to be paying back to our country. And I've got this idea about something I'm calling the National Service Reserve. It's kind of like if any of you have ever been in the military reserve. You get the training and you're kind of on call and you practice and train. And then if you're needed, you're called up. I want a civilian national reserve, and I want people of all ages in it. And we would train you so that if there's a natural disaster or some other problem that has to be dealt with, we could call you up to go do that. And it's a way of making sure that people are giving back all the time to this country because that's how we build solidarity. That's how we get to know each other better.\nSo I'm pretty excited about what we're going to do together. And I can't do any of this without your help. I really am asking you to do everything you can to make sure you're registered, to tell your friends and anybody else you can talk to make sure they're registered. As I said, go to iwillvote.com. You can find it out right there on that site. And we'd love to have you be involved in the campaign because I know that if we win in November, we can summon the positive spirit of our country back again. I think I have to do everything, everything in my power to bring people together, and I will.\nIt's really important to me that you know that I want to be your president whether you vote for me or not. Obviously, I hope you do, but I will be your president, and I will stand up for you, and I will work for you, and I will fight for you. So please, if you're not registered, get registered by tomorrow, and then you can start voting October 12th. And whatever issue, whatever issue you care about, imagine that that is on the ballot. Imagine if you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage, if you believe – if you believe that we finally should have paid family leave in this country like every other advanced economy, if you believe climate change is real and we could save our planet by creating a lot of jobs at the same time, if you believe diversity is America's strength, not a weakness, if you believe women should be able to make our own health care decisions and that LGBT Americans should be treated equally across America, and you should be able to live up to your potential, no matter who you are or where you come from, then start voting October the 12th!\nAnd I promise you this. Together we're going to prove that we can make the future what it should be for all of you; that there is a positive, optimistic, confident America out there; that America's best days are ahead of us, not the dark and divisive vision of my opponent, but one in keeping with what I see as I travel across America – the energy, the dynamism, the entrepreneurial spirit of all Americans, but particularly young Americans. So please, join this campaign. Be part of it for the next 29 days. And together we will prove that we can have the future that we want and that yes, love trumps hate! Thank you, Ohio State!\"", "timestamp": "2016-10-10", "title": "Remarks at Ohio State University in Columbus"}

The President also expressed that his thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of those who lost their lives from the storm, and for all those who have been affected.  The President continues to stress that the response to the storm is far from over and the danger continues from flooding for the coming days, and urges those in the potential path of the flooding to continue to listen to local officials.\nEarlier today, the President also received a briefing from Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Lisa Monaco on the impacts from Hurricane Matthew and ongoing federal response and recovery efforts. Recovery efforts are underway in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, and the response to record flooding continues in North Carolina, including thousands of water rescues supported by FEMA, Coast Guard, Army Corps of Engineers, and National Park Service responders. As of this morning, more than 1,500 FEMA staff including Disaster Survivor Assistance Teams (DSAT) and Incident Management Assistance Teams (IMAT) are deployed to impacted states in support of response and recovery efforts for Matthew. Additionally, FEMA is transporting prepositioned commodities to affected areas at the request of states. More than 5.2 million meals, 3.7 million liters of water, and 72,000 blankets were staged before the storm for state, tribal, and local officials to distribute to individuals should they need them.

{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "note": "Speech as delivered.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119156", "text": "\"Hello, Miami Dade College! It is so great to be here with all of you.\nAnd I want to thank everyone for gathering and in particular, I want to thank all of the elected officials. Thanks to Congressman Patrick Murphy who I hope is the next senator from Florida. Thanks to Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Thank you to Mayor Phillip Levine of Miami Beach. Thanks to Mayor Phillip Stoddard of South Miami. Thanks to all the others who were part of the program. As we were coming in, we heard lots of energy coming from this crowd, and I was told as I was coming out, there's an overflow, but they can hear us in the overflow, and we're so happy you're here as well! So thanks to the overflow crowd. But what I am most excited about is to be here with one of the world's most foremost leaders on climate change: Al Gore.\nAbout a decade ago, Al made a movie called 'An Inconvenient Truth.' Now, maybe some of you have seen it, but if you haven't, I hope you'll watch it tonight. It doesn't have a lot of special effects – but it does have a lot of drama.\nAnd here's the main message: climate change is real, it's urgent, and America can take the lead in the world in addressing it. Right? We here in America can develop new clean energy solutions. We can transform our economy. We can rally the world to cut carbon pollution. And above all, we can fulfill our moral obligation to protect our planet for our children and our grandchildren.\nNow, let me just say – so, so let's remember, let's remember what's at stake. I'm running against a guy who denies science, denies climate change, claims it's a hoax created by the Chinese. So this is something that Al Gore's been working on for a really long time. And I want you to know how far back he goes. It was in 1982 when he held the very first hearing on climate change in the House of Representatives with the world-famous climate scientist Jim Hansen. And then when Al became a senator, he continued to raise the alarm and look for solutions, and as vice president, he led America's efforts to negotiate the Kyoto Protocol to cut greenhouse gas emissions. You take all this together, those 30 years of leadership led Al Gore to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.\nI was very proud because he had been determined and persistent, and in the face of a lot of people – in public life, in business, in elsewhere who were trying to diminish the importance of the science – he never wavered. And in the years since, the climate challenge has only grown more stark. And I will tell you this, it is one of the most important issues at stake in this election.\nLook at it this way. Our next president will either step up our efforts to address climate change, to protect our planet, to protect our health, and to create good jobs that cannot be outsourced by growing our clean energy economy. Or in the alternative, we will be dragged backwards and our whole future will be put at risk.\nSo we've really got to get this right. And if you need additional convincing, just remember what happened this week. Hurricane Matthew killed at least 26 people in our country, more than a thousand as far as we know right now in Haiti. North Carolina is still dealing with serious flooding and will be at least for the rest of the week, if not longer. We all need to support each other as our communities put the pieces back together and begin the long road back from this disaster.\nThat's why I've encouraged everyone to give what you can afford to the Florida Disaster Fund or to Team Rubicon, the veterans organization working to respond to Hurricane Matthew, or to UNICEF, helping children and families on the ground in Haiti.\nNow, some will say, 'We've always had hurricanes. They've always been destructive.' And that's true. But Hurricane Matthew was likely more destructive because of climate change. Right now, the ocean is at or near record-high temperatures – and that contributed to the torrential rainfall and the flash flooding that we saw in the Carolinas. Sea levels have already risen about a foot – one foot – in much of the Southeast, which means that Matthew's storm surge was higher and the flooding was more severe.\nPlus, as you know, the impact of climate change goes beyond extreme events like hurricanes. It's become a daily reality here in Miami. You have streets in Miami Beach and in Shorecrest that are flooding at high tide. The ocean is bubbling up through the sewer system. Sometimes, people call 311 because they assume a water main must have broken when actually it is the sea rising around them.\nSo, if you need proof that climate change is real and that it's costly, there you go. So at this rate, at this rate, my friends, my friends, please. Let's focus on what's really important in this election and in your future and the future of our country, because this is what I want you to hear and understand. At the rate we are going, one in eight homes in Florida could be underwater by the end of the century, and when kids – like that adorable young boy over there on his dad's shoulders – are grandparents, we believe that's more than $400 billion worth of property in Florida at risk, and nationwide, it's as much as $882 billion in property at risk.\nBut there's also health consequences. Mosquitoes that carry diseases like the Zika virus and ticks that carry Lyme disease are expanding their ranges. And hotter summers and longer pollen seasons are making allergies and asthma worse, which is especially bad for our children. And look at what is happening in California, a brutal five-year drought. Wildfires have burned more than 9 million acres in our country last year.\nAnd it's also about national security. The Pentagon has identified climate change as a threat to our America's national security. The U.S. Atlantic Fleet is based in Norfolk, Virginia. It's the largest naval installation in the world. And because of rising sea level, the base is frequently flooded, even when it's sunny. So that's why the Pentagon is looking at how climate change will affect readiness and operations, not just in Norfolk, but at all of our military bases around the world.\nSo you would think if you look at the facts, if you listen to the science, that even the most committed climate skeptic would say, 'Ok, I agree, something's happening here. We need to take it seriously.'\nBut unfortunately, there are still plenty of people – in Washington, on the campaign trail – who won't face what's happening right in front of us.\nDonald Trump, is, quote, 'not a big believer' in climate change. As I said, he said it's a hoax created by the Chinese. And in our first debate two weeks ago, he tried to deny saying that. But that tweet is still there for everyone to see.\nAnd I would wish that Donald would actually listen to people here in Florida, like Miami Beach's Mayor Philip Levine and others who are doing incredible work to address these 'Sunny Day' Floods. Or maybe, he would listen to Miami Beach Commissioner John Elizabeth Alemбn. Or maybe he would listen to Miami Beach Commissioner, John Elizabeth Alemбn. John Elizabeth is a Republican, but she's supporting our campaign—because she knows America can't afford a candidate who doesn't accept climate science. Or maybe Donald would listen to our military leaders who say climate change threatens our national security, or what about the ranchers in Colorado, or the mayors in Arizona or the community leaders in Alaska who say, 'Our lives and jobs and families are being affected – please, let's come together as a country and do something about it.'\nWe cannot risk putting a climate denier in the White House. At all, that is absolutely unacceptable.\nWe need a president who believes in science and who has a plan to lead America in facing this threat, creating good jobs, and yes, saving our planet.\nSo here's what I want to do.\nFirst, we need to do a lot more on clean energy. The clean energy superpower of the 21st century is probably going to be either Germany, China, or us—and I want it to be us. And I want you to be part of making it us.\nAnd we need to accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy and create high paying jobs, building and installing more solar panels and wind turbines. Modernizing our electric grid. Retrofitting buildings. Building resilient, 21st century infrastructure, and we have to make sure no community is left out or left behind—not our cities or our small towns or our remote, rural areas.\nNow, you wouldn't know it if you only listened to my opponent talk about how terrible everything is. He has such a dark, divisive view of America, but that doesn't tell the story about what's really going on. It's actually pretty exciting. In red states and blue states, local leaders are stepping up. Rural electric co-ops are investing in community solar power and you see that across America – union workers in Michigan, union workers in Michigan are getting ready to build electric Chevys in a plant powered by clean energy. Iowa, Iowa is already getting a third of its electricity from wind. Wind turbines are going up in New England and on Lake Erie. Renewable energy is already the fastest-growing source of new jobs in America. I think that is so exciting – there are nearly 2 million people already working in energy efficiency.\nAnd in Spartanburg, South Carolina, a project called ReGenesis is taking an old landfill and turning it into a solar farm. That landfill was a blight and a health threat, just 250 feet away from a residential neighborhood. Now, that same land will generate enough clean, renewable electricity to power 500 homes.\nSo this is what we can do. And I think Washington should back up and support doing more of that. As president, I want us to have 500 million solar panels installed across America by the end of my first term. And let's generate enough renewable energy to power every home in America within the decade. Let's make our buildings and factories more energy efficient and cut our oil consumption by one-third.\nAnd we can get there by investing in cutting edge research, to keep developing cheaper and better clean energy technologies, investing in clean energy infrastructure and advanced manufacturing, putting big partnerships together between states, cities, and rural communities.\nWe can do all of this and create millions of good-paying jobs as we do. So I'm hoping that these good jobs will offer security and dignity while we produce the clean energy that will power the economy of the future. The clean energy solutions are being developed right here in America. We want them manufactured in America, installed in America, and putting people to work in America.\nAnd while we do that, let's make sure our communities are ready for the impacts of climate change that are coming right at us. We need to invest in resilient infrastructure. Now, sometimes that will mean building a seawall; other times, let's be more creative – like in New York Harbor, where we are replanting oyster beds to form natural barriers to storm surge. Sometimes we'll overhaul an outdated sewer system to deal with flooding from heavy downpours. In Philadelphia, they're trying something else: green roofs, porous pavements, curbside gardens to help absorb storm water.\nAnd here's something we don't talk enough about. Let's make sure our hospitals can stay open and operational in any kind of disaster. Because sadly, I saw what happened in New York during Hurricane Sandy, newborns who had been on respirators had to be evacuated down nine flights of stairs in one New York hospital, because the electricity went off. Nurses, I love nurses – heroic, courageous nurses were carrying those babies and manually squeezing bags of air to keep them breathing. Now, here in Miami, you know how important this is. You have retrofitted the Nicklaus Children's Hospital with a hurricane-resistant shell for exactly this reason. And every hospital in the country should follow your lead and build in more resilience.\nAnd then finally, we have got to lead the world to confront the climate challenge. If we don't do it, nobody will do it. We must confront the climate challenge. There's no doubt about that. And so, let's move on with the kind of leadership that the world as well as our country deserves.\nWhen I was Secretary of State, I worked with President Obama to make climate change a top diplomatic priority. We fought to get China and India and other major polluters to agree for the first time in history to be part of the solution. In fact, we had to crash a secret meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark – slip past the guards – it was all very cloak and dagger. But for a really important purpose, and because of that breakthrough, and a lot of patient, persistent work, and because of American leadership, 195 nations signed on to a global agreement last December. It's called the Paris Agreement. And I am not exaggerating when I say it is our last, best chance to solve the global, climate crisis.\nAnd what does Donald Trump want to do? He wants to cancel the Paris Agreement. He doesn't care what it would do to the planet. He doesn't care how much that would damage American leadership in the world. He doesn't care what it would do to the future we leave our kids and our grandkids.\nWell, he may not care – but we do. And that's why this election is so critically important because on the ballot, it is not just my name. It's every issue we care about it's our values as a country.\nClimate change needs to be a voting issue. We need to elect people up and down the ballot, at every level of government, who take it seriously and are willing to roll up their sleeves and get something done. Please, we cannot keep sending climate deniers and defeatists to Congress or to state houses—and certainly not to the White House.\nAnd if you care about climate, your Senate race is also really important, and I'll tell you why. It is unacceptable, it is an unacceptable response for Marco Rubio, when asked about climate change to say, 'I'm not a scientist.' Well, why doesn't he ask a scientist and then maybe then he'd understand why it is so important that he, representing Florida, be committed to climate change? That's why I hope that you'll elect Patrick Murphy to the United States Senate.\nLook, we need leaders who can get results. It's easy to stonewall. It's not enough to protest: we need creativity, we need hard work. And when it comes to climate change, we don't have a minute to waste.\nSo, I know it's easy to get cynical—especially about our politics. I get that. But this election matters more than any has in a really long time, and I believe that as strongly as I can, we've got to address this issue for our sakes, our children, our grandchildren. And it's so critically important when you think about how leadership can make a difference.\nAnd just look, if you will – look at the difference between your state, the Sunshine State, which has less solar energy than New Jersey has right now. And do you know why? Because you have a governor who has ordered the state government never to use the words 'climate change.' So my friends, this is a big deal in the election, and it is going to be a big deal for our country and our world. And there isn't anybody – there isn't anybody who knows more, has done more, has worked harder. I know he was in Miami just last year, training and educating people to be climate change activists. I can't wait to have Al Gore advising me when I am President of the United States. So please join me in welcoming our former vice president, a climate change leader and an all-around great guy, Al Gore.\"", "timestamp": "2016-10-11", "title": "Remarks at the Kendall Campus of Miami Dade College in Miami, Florida"}

Trump", "note": "As prepared for delivery.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119171", "text": "The Hillary Clinton documents released by WikiLeaks make more clear than ever just how much is at stake in this election. This election will determine whether we remain a free country, or we become a corrupt Banana Republic controlled by large donors and foreign governments.\nThe election of Hillary Clinton would lead to the destruction of our country.\nToday we learned the Department of Justice fed information to the Clinton campaign about the e-mail investigation, so that the campaign could be prepared to cover up her crimes. This is collusion and corruption of the highest order, and is one more reason why I will ask my Attorney General to appoint a special prosecutor. We have to investigate the investigation.\nHillary bleached and deleted 33,000 emails after a congressional subpoena – and then destroyed her phones with a hammer – all to cover-up her crimes. People have gone to jail for doing far less. She also lost as much as $6 billion taxpayer dollars.\nThese Wikileaks emails confirm what those of us here today have known all along: Hillary Clinton is the vessel for a corrupt global establishment that is raiding our country and surrendering our sovereignty. This criminal government cartel doesn't recognize borders, but believes in global governance, unlimited immigration, and rule by corporations.\n...\nEven Chelsea Clinton, the WikiLeaks emails show, expressed \"serious concerns\" about conflicts of interests at the Clinton Foundation and State Department.\nDuring a recent trip to Florida, I had a chance to spend some time with the incredible residents of Little Haiti. The Haitian community has contributed so much to this country. I also learned from them, firsthand, how much they despise the Clintons for what they did to the people of Haiti.\nNew emails revealed today by ABC News show that during the deadly earthquake in Haiti, which killed over 150,000 people, the Clintons couldn't stop cashing in. As people were dying in Haiti, Clinton insiders were separating out requests from \"Friends of Bill\" or \"William Jefferson Clinton VIPs\" so that their business interests or contracts would receive special treatment.\nPeople who were labeled \"Not Friends of Bill\" were placed on the sidelines.\nIn their biggest project, the Clintons used $400 million in aid and U.S. taxpayer funds to build what amounted to a sweatshop. And guess who set it up? Cheryl Mills, Hillary's Chief of Staff who helped destroy her emails, and then got an immunity deal from the FBI that included the destruction of her computer.\nThe company that benefitted from Mills' actions then invested in a company owned by Cheryl Mills.\nToday, as Haiti's death toll from Hurricane Matthew is on the rise, we should never forget how Bill and Hillary Clinton handled Haiti last time.\nTo all of our friends in Haiti, your day of justice is coming, and it arrives on November 8th.\nNot only have the Clintons ripped off Haiti, but the new emails show members of the Clinton team attacking Catholics. This is deeply offensive. It's just the latest evidence of the hatred that the Clinton Campaign has for everyday Americans. We've all read the reports and heard the stories about how disrespectfully she treats law enforcement, secret service, and others in uniform. She even smeared all of America's police officers as essentially racist.\nI'm proud of the fact that I have always treated the working people of this country with dignity and respect, especially our military and law enforcement personnel.\nThe WikiLeaks emails show that Hillary's staff even has to give her secret notes on when she needs to smile.\nThe emails also show, yet again, that the DNC rigged the Democratic election to give it to Hillary Clinton. The DNC Vice Chair was caught feeding information about Bernie Sanders' plans to the Clinton Campaign.\nTo all the Bernie voters out there: don't vote for a Wall Street sellout like Hillary Clinton. A vote for Hillary is a vote for more reckless foreign invasions, more Wall Street cheating, more terrible trade deals, and – as confirmed by Wikileaks – she also wants to cut Medicare and Social Security.\n...\nWikileaks also shows something I have been warning about for a very long time. The media is simply an extension of the Clinton Campaign. It's just one more way the system is rigged.\nReporters who work for these outlets – like the Washington Post, or the New York Times – may think of themselves as journalists, but they are actually just cogs in a corporate political machine.\nThe emails show the New York Times, Boston Globe, Univision and Jon Harwood of CNBC all doing favors for the Clintons, and smother the Clintons with praise. The NYT even gave Clinton veto power of her quotes in their stories. It's called corruption.\nThe emails also show that the Hillary was given the CNN townhall questions before her big debate against Bernie Sanders. Dona Brazile, the DNC Vice Chair, emailed: \"from time to time I get the questions in advance.\"\nThe media can't report on the establishment because the media is the establishment. And they're all teamed up against you, the American people.\n...\nOn November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.\nWe are going to replace our corrupt global establishment that has failed us on borders, on trade, on foreign policy, on the economy, and so much more. We are going to replace the failed leadership in Washington who have betrayed you, squandered our wealth, and sold our country.\nI am asking all Americans – Republicans, Independents and Democrats – to join us in our campaign to give our government back to the American people.\nI am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation – and I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\nYou're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like you've never seen before. We're going to make history together. You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote I've ever cast for anyone at any time.\nA vote for me is a vote for change, and a vote for me is really a vote for you. Once again, we are going to have a government of, by and for the people.\nWe will make America wealthy again.\nWe will make America strong again.\nWe will make America safe again.\nAnd we are going to make America great again.", "timestamp": "2016-10-11", "title": "Excerpts of Remarks at Aaron Bessant Park in Panama City, Florida"}

EARNEST: Hello everybody. I didn't realize we were having such a good time back here. I guess the fun is over, though, because I'm here.\nLet me do two announcements at the top and then we'll get to your questions. I think I have a sense of what a couple of them might be.\nLet me start by noting that today is International Day of the Girl. And as you know, the President and First Lady launched Let Girls Learn last March to help the millions of adolescent girls around the world who are not in school get the education that they deserve. To continue these efforts, the President's FY2017 budget requested more than $100 million in new funds for Let Girls Learn. And since the launch, together with the U.S. Department of State, USAID, the Peace Corps, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, and most recently, the Department of Labor and the Department of Agriculture, Let Girls Learn has committed more than a billion dollars in girls' education programming in more than 50 countries, and announced more than 110 private sector commitments to adolescent girls' education.\nLater today, the First Lady will participation in two capstone Let Girls Learn events. She will be at the Newseum for a livestreamed global conversation hosted by Glamour Magazine and its Girl Project, with girls in Peru, Tanzania, Jordan, the UK, and of course, in D.C. As a part of the program, they'll be discussing what they have faced and overcome in achieving an education.\nMrs. Obama, as well as Ambassador Rice, will host a White House screening for the new CNN Films documentary, \"We Will Rise,\" which was filmed on the First Lady's trip to Liberia and Morocco earlier this summer. The film features Meryl Streep, who will be at the White House event, and Freida Pinto. The film will be released on CNN, around the world, premiering in the United States tomorrow at 9:00 p.m. Forty-four of the girls who the First Lady met on that trip over the summer will be at both events over the course of the day today. So the First Lady obviously has got some important events today.\nThere's one other thing about the President's activities on the trip that I wanted to give you a heads-up on. Prior to the beginning of the town hall, the President will have an opportunity to do a short clutch with several of My Brother's Keeper initiative participants from across the country who are also participating in the town hall. So he'll get a chance to visit with them a little bit and talk to them about their experience in the My Brother's Keeper initiative in the community. And then they'll later participate in the town hall that the President is participating in.\nThis is an event that was organized by ESPN and their Undefeated platform. It'll be hosted by Stan Verrett, as you know, who is an ESPN anchor, and it will be premiering tonight at 10:00 p.m. on ESPN, across the country.\nQ: Pool access to the clutch beforehand?\nMR. EARNEST: There's not pool access to the clutch, which is why I wanted to give you a head-up on it. And I think there is a chance, although we don't know this -- there is a chance that some of the participants may be called on to ask questions at the town hall, in which case they would reference an interaction with the President. So I didn't want you guys to be all surprised about that.\nQ: Why is he holding a clutch and not a meeting?\nMR. EARNEST: Right, it's basically is not like a -- it's not a formal opportunity for them to sit down and meet with the President, but they'll have a brief opportunity to talk a little bit about their experience.\nI think that's all I have, so we can go to your questions now.\nQ: Now that the U.S. has come out and said that Russia was behind the recent hacking attempts, can you talk a little about what the next steps are in terms of the U.S. taking action against Russia for the hacking?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the intelligence community did announce in a statement on Friday afternoon that they have concluded that the Russian government directed the email compromises of persons and institutions in the United States, including political organizations. And the disclosure of those emails at sites like WikiLeaks, and DCLeaks, and Guccifer 2.0 is consistent with methods and motivations of Russian efforts.\nThe intelligence community has assessed that the theft of this information and its disclosure is in an attempt to interfere with the U.S. political system. These tactics are not new for Russia. We've seen them use -- deploy these tactics to try to destabilize democracies in other parts of the world. I think, in every case, those democracies are not as durable and resilient as the U.S. system of government and our political systems.\nWith regard to a response, we obviously will ensure that a U.S. response is proportional. It is unlikely that our response would be announced in advance. It's certainly possible that the President could choose response options that we never announce. The President has talked before about the significant capabilities that the U.S. government has to both defend our systems in the United States, but also carry out offensive operations in other countries. So there are a range of responses that are available to the President, and he will consider a response that's proportional.\nQ: Would that include sanctions or some sort of retaliatory activity against Russia?\nMR. EARNEST: I wouldn't be specific in terms of foreshadowing potential responses, but there are a range of options on the table, including the two that you have mentioned.\nQ: On Russia, Vladimir Putin just cancelled a trip planned to France later this month. French President Franзois Hollande answered by saying he was always ready to talk with Mr. Putin in order to advance peace. I was wondering whether the President sees it as -- is there value for him to interact directly with President Putin at this stage regarding Syria, be it over the phone or meeting him? Is there a value there?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me start by saying that when we talked about this situation a little bit last week in the briefing room, you heard me highlight a variety of examples that indicate how Russia is increasingly isolated from the rest of the international community because of the way they have handled the situation inside of Syria. And the most apt comparison is, when you look at President Putin's participation at the 2015 U.N. General Assembly, he came and gave a much ballyhooed speech, he had a bilateral meeting with President Obama, and he discussed the constructive role that Russia was prepared to play in resolving the situation inside of Syria, particularly with regard to confronting extremist elements inside of Syria.\nA year later, in 2016, we haven't seen dramatic changes in terms of the situation on the ground. We know that Russia's efforts have been primarily focused on shoring up the Assad regime. And they have not had a lot of success, thus far at least, in rolling back territory that had previously been held by opposition groups.\nWe have, over the course of the last year, made significant gains against extremist elements inside of Syria, but that's because of the work of the United States and our coalition partners, not because of the work that has been done by the Russians. Russia's efforts, to the extent that they are focused on extremists, have not been coordinated with the broader coalition. And, like I said, most of their efforts have been focused on shoring up the Assad regime a year later that has put Russia in a position in which they are isolated from the rest of the international community. President Putin didn't even come to attend the U.N. General Assembly, let alone attempt to speak.\nAnd I cite all of this because I think we've got another good example. President Putin was planning to come to France to dedicate a new church. But he cancelled those plans after learning that President Hollande was eager to engage in a conversation about what could be done to address the violence inside of Syria. That comes on the heels, of course, of a French-sponsored resolution at the U.N. Security Council being blocked by a Russian veto.\nSo Russia stands alone -- or at least they stand alone with countries like Iran, the Assad regime, and Venezuela -- in trying to justify their actions inside of Syria. The rest of the international community is gravely concerned about the tactics that they have used, including the targeting of civilians, the targeting of hospitals, and their support for an Assad regime that uses chlorine as a weapon, and other tactics like barrel bombs that are having a devastating impact on civilian populations inside of Syria. All of that has hurt President Putin's personal standing in the international community. It's also isolated Russia in a way that has not been beneficial to their economy or to a wide array of their national security interests. And again, I think the cancelling of his trip to France is further evidence of that.\nHad President Putin decided to follow through on his trip to France, and had President Hollande raised, both in public and in private, the international community's concerns with Russia's actions inside of Syria, we would have had no objection to that. But President Putin avoided that scenario by canceling his trip altogether. And it's an indication of the weakened position from which he's operating in.\nQ: Just from President Obama's perspective, does he believe this is not the right time for him to engage directly with Vladimir Putin on Syria?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, we would have no objection to a French conversation like that. As you know, Secretary Kerry continues to engage with his Russian counterpart bilaterally. There are also a range of conversations that are taking place in a variety of multilateral settings that involve the Russians, including at the U.N. Security Council and the International Syria Support Group that had a meeting in Europe last week. That's another multilateral effort that includes the United States, Russia, and other regional actors that have a direct interest in the situation in Syria.\nSo our multilateral engagement continues. What has changed with regard to our conversations with Russia is that we're no longer engaged in efforts to try to resuscitate a cessation of hostilities in exchange for U.S. military cooperation, because it was quite clear that Russia was either unable or unwilling to live up to their end of the bargain, to exercise influence with the Assad regime and reduce violence inside of Syria.\nQ: Can you address these reports today from WikiLeaks that suggest that Obama administration officials were tipping off or somehow coordinating with the Clinton campaign on this emails investigation? Is that a fair criticism? Are you confident and is the President confident that the administration and the White House is as removed from that as you should have been?\nMR. EARNEST: Let me say that I'm not going to comment directly on the stolen emails of a private citizen. That was true when I was asked about the stolen emails from General Powell. And that's going to be true with regard to questions about stolen emails from John Podesta.\nWhat I can say in general is that both the Attorney General and the FBI Director have made clear that the investigation of Secretary Clinton's use of a private email server was conducted without regard to partisan politics. Again, you can go and check the testimony and public statements of both Attorney General Lynch and FBI Director Comey. They indicated that there was no influence from political actors on the investigation. This is an investigation that was led by career prosecutors who followed the facts and exercised their own professional judgement in arriving at a conclusion. And that was done without regard to -- without any political interference.\nAnd I also know that at least Director Comey indicated that there was not even an attempt by the White House to influence that investigation. So I'd rely on the public statements from the individuals who were responsible to affirm the independence of that investigation.\nQ: But even if there wasn't any interference or any evidence of interference, would it be appropriate for someone in the administration to be communicating with a presidential campaign about the content of that investigation, whether it be status or anything else?\nMR. EARNEST: With regard to any communications by the Clinton campaign to the Department of Justice, I'll refer you to the Clinton campaign. And if there was a need for an official at the Department of Justice to communicate with the Clinton campaign, then I'd refer you to the Department of Justice about what information was appropriate to communicate, if any.\nObviously, it was Secretary Clinton who was under investigation by the Justice Department, so presumably there was some communication there to, for example, schedule her interview, which she agreed to. But for the scope of those interactions and for the propriety of them, I'd refer you to the Department of Justice.\nBut I'd be remiss if I didn't remind you that the two individuals who were responsible for conducting that investigation both said publicly and under oath that their investigation was conducted free of political interference. And that is consistent with the President's expectations about how this should be handled.\nQ: Can you just talk a little bit about what the President hopes to accomplish in his event for Secretary Clinton this evening in Greensboro? And who is talking to? Is this primarily targeted toward African American voters like that radio ad that was released yesterday?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, the President is enthusiastic about that campaign event that he has later today. The President is looking forward to addressing a crowd in Greensboro and making a strong, affirmative case for Secretary Clinton -- her values, her experience, and the agenda that she has for the country.\nThe President obviously campaigned vigorously in North Carolina, both in 2008 and in 2012. He was the first Democrat to win the state of North Carolina at the presidential level in at least a generation when he did so in 2008. As I recall, it was the most closely contested state in 2012. So this is a battleground state. The President is obviously gratified that there is public evidence to indicate that Secretary Clinton has a lead in this state. But she certainly is not taking that lead for granted, and the President has indicated he's prepared to do everything he can to support her. And he's going to make a strong case to the crowd in Greensboro.\nI would expect the crowd in Greensboro to be reflective of the broader community in Greensboro, which is, I anticipate it will be pretty diverse. And one of the reasons that Secretary Clinton is -- well, let me say it this way: One of the reasons that President Obama did well in 2008 and 2012 in this state is that it's difficult to win in North Carolina without assembling a genuinely diverse coalition of support across party lines, across racial lines, across gender lines. And that was critical to President Obama's success in 2008. And I think most independent observers would say that will be critical to Secretary Clinton's success here in 2016.\nQ: We haven't heard from you guys since the Trump tape came out on Friday. I guess two separate areas to go down. One is the President's reaction to the tape itself, whether he thinks Donald Trump was describing sexual assault. And then the other is sort of reaction among Republicans -- whether the White House believes that Republicans at this point have a duty to sort of disavow from him. What your reaction to the sort of friction between Speaker Ryan and the Donald Trump campaign is, and what you're kind of assessment of that is right now.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me start by saying that the President found the tape as repugnant as most Americans did. And I think there's been a pretty clear statement by people all along the ideological spectrum that those statements constituted sexual assault. I know you heard from the Vice President about that over the weekend, and that's an observation that we've heard from a wide variety of sources. That's why many people I believe have concluded that those statements are worthy of sharp condemnation.\nWith regard to the state of the Republican Party, I think you've heard my riff on this before. But for more than seven years, Republicans in Washington have prioritized opposition to President Obama above all else, above even advancing a conservative agenda that they claim to support. That's why it's not particularly surprising that the base of the Republican Party now has nominated somebody whose notoriety is derived primarily from his colorful opposition to President Obama and is promoting a variety of positions that aren't particularly conservative.\nSo I guess -- I think what my mom would say in this situation is, you reap what you sow. And for seven and a half years, Republicans in Washington have been sowing anti-Obama rhetoric to the exclusion of facts, to the exclusion of any sort of governing agenda, and even to the exclusion of conservative doctrine. And I think that's why Republican leaders in Washington find themselves in the situation that they're in right now. And it's not something from which they will quickly recover.\nQ: The President has talked at times about you trust Americans not to elect Donald Trump as President. He's also said something along the lines of, Democrats need to run scared and make sure they don't take it for granted. But does the White House, given the last two weeks or so, feel more confident right now about the state of the election and where this is headed, given some of the poll numbers as well?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the President, for more than a year, has shown confidence, but he's also resisted complacency. And that would explain why the President is doing a campaign event in Greensboro tonight. The President is energized by this campaign and by the opportunity to advocate for Secretary Clinton's election. And you'll hear him deliver a very forceful case in support of her vision, and values, and experience that she would bring to the job. And I think the President, in terms of visibly making this argument, is only going to ramp up his activity in the four weeks that remain until Election Day.\nQ: A federal appeals court has ruled that the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is unconstitutional, but he said that this could be remedied if the President is put in charge of the authority to fire somebody at will that's the head of the agency. What is the White House's reaction to that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we're still looking at the decision. It was only handed down a little bit before we boarded the plane here. Based on the initial reading of the ruling, it doesn't actually undermine the current activities of the CFPB. In fact, I understand that that actually was an option that was available to the judges who ruled in the case, but that was not an option that they chose to pursue. With regard to the next steps in the legal process, I refer you to the Department of Justice who will take a look at the ruling and evaluate the next steps in the legal process.\nSo obviously we're disappointed by the decision, but we continue to have confidence, as expressed by the judges, in the ability of the CFPB to do the important work of protecting consumers in Washington, D.C.\nQ: Josh, can I ask about -- President Erdogan today, heated remarks for Prime Minister Abadi of Iraq. He said Turkey would be involved in the Mosul offensive whether Iraq liked it or not. What's the U.S. reaction to that? Do you expect the Turks to be involved in that? And what kind of concerns, if any, do you have about both Iraqi sovereignty and the relationship with the Kurds who have been essential to our fight in Iraq?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I did not see President Erdogan's latest remarks. What I can tell you as a principle, though, is that the United States has made clear that the presence of the counter-ISIL coalition inside of Iraq is at the invitation of the Iraq central government, and all of the operations that are carried out against ISIL are under the command and control of the Iraqi central government, and that the contributions that are made, including by the United States and the rest of our coalition partners, are consistent with the orders and strategic decisions made by the Iraqi central government. This is a sovereign country. They are a sovereign territory. The counter-ISIL coalition is operating there at their invitation, and we're going to continue to coordinate with those forces that operate under the command and control of the Iraqi central government.\nOkay, all right. See you all in a little bit.\nEND 2:32 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2016-10-11", "title": "Press Gaggle by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}
{"author": "Michelle Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=120921", "text": "MRS. OBAMA: Hi, everyone.\nMS. LEIVE: Well, welcome. Thank you so much for joining us for this discussion today. I know this is a cause near and dear to both of your hearts, so I guess I want to ask -- start with the most basic question, which is why? Mrs. Obama, why this for you? Why this cause?\nMRS. OBAMA: Well, education is a very personal thing for me. As I tell girls whenever I meet them, I wouldn't be here, sitting here not just in this chair but in the life that I have, if it weren't for my education. I know that when you hear the phrase \"knowledge is power,\" it's true.\nThrough my education, I didn't just develop skills, I didn't just develop the ability to learn, but I developed confidence. I mean, going to Princeton from a predominantly working-class community, a public school where people told me that I couldn't do a whole range of things, and then going to one of the top schools in the world and being able to compete and to thrive -- that is an ultimate confidence booster. And it was clear to me that if I could get through Princeton at the top of my class, I could do anything in the world.\nSo making sure that girls around the world who are just as bright, just as able as me, have the same opportunities to take their education seriously, to have access, has become a mission that I take very seriously. So as I said, this is something that means a great deal. We can't afford not to educate girls and give women the power and the access that they need. So we're going to keep working hard.\nMS. LEIVE: All right.\nYara, why does it matter to you?\nMS. SHAHIDI: Well, as a senior -- I'm applying to colleges right now -- but as a senior, education has been so important in my life. And also just an actress it's opened so many doors because it's made me truly interested in the world around me. And I think my love of acting is the same reason I want to study sociology, because I'm interested in humans.\nMRS. OBAMA: I was a sociology major.\nMS. SHAHIDI: Oh, my goodness. Write my recommendation letter, please! (Laughter.)\nMRS. OBAMA: You got it. You got it. I got you covered, kid.\nMS. LEIVE: Seize your moment, girl. (Laughter.)\nMRS. OBAMA: See how you do that? You take the opportunity. Way to go, Yara. I can do that.\nMS. SHAHIDI: Education has played such a key role in, like you said, me having confidence and me having the ability to, I guess, vocalize what I wanted to say and give me the confidence to even be on this panel right now, because I had been freaking out -- I'm still freaking out that I'm sitting next to you.\nBut it's so important in the development of just being a kid to know that you have the knowledge to succeed in the world around you. Because it's more than just, oh, I memorized what the textbook said. But it really applies to every, like, daily life occurrences, and just how you get a job or how you have a career, or how you want to do whatever you want to do in life. And so it is important to make sure that everybody has access to that because it's been so critical in my growing.\nMS. LEIVE: Well, I want to go to one of our watch parties. One of the biggest obstacles that is facing girls right now is this still-pervasive idea -- and, Mrs. Obama, you've talked about it a lot -- that boys are more entitled to an education than girls are. It's changing, but it's changing slowly. So, in so many cultures, girls are really still expected to keep up the work of the home, and often to drop out if family obligations require that someone be there. I want to know how students feel about this.\nSo let's start at the Children's Museum in Amman, Jordan, where daytime TV host, Mais Nobani (ph), has joined a group of students. Tell us a little bit about what's on the girls' minds there. And, by the way, hi.\nMS. NOBANI: Hello. How are you all? First, I would like to say -- I would like to thank you. We would like to thank you, of course, me and the girls, for having us here, and to the U.S. Embassy, of course, for having us here with you to talk about the girls' education and also to talk to the First Lady, Michelle Obama. So thank you very much.\nWell, we've been talking a lot about the girls' education in Jordan, and we came up with some facts and statistics that we would really like to share with you. The first fact that might be interesting for you is that girls in Jordan, they out-perform boys in school and through university. And we are so proud to say that Jordanian society, they value education so much. So we are so proud of this. And another statistic that I would really like to share with you, it says that over the last 35 years, literacy rates for Jordanian women rose from 55 percent to 99 percent. And more women than men go to university. But we cannot deny that we have some gender stereotypes that still exist and persist.\nSo, I'm having her -- Jamana (ph) beside me, who would like to introduce herself first, and then she would like to ask about gender stereotypes in other countries.\nQ: Hi, everyone. So happy to be here. My name is Jamana Hadil (ph). I'm 15 years old and I'm in tenth grade. I was born in Amman. I love reading books. And my favorite is Demi Lovato. (Laughter.) Things here in Jordan are changing, and our generation is changing society. But there are some gender stereotypes still exists, like boys have more freedoms than girls, because girls' reputation is a very important thing here.\nWe have a question for the First Lady and Yara. You have met so many girls around the world who face cultural barriers. And our question is, how do we change perceptions on the value of girls? Thank you.\nMRS. OBAMA: That's an excellent question. And hello to all the girls in Jordan. Thank you for sharing those statistics. It's so good to see the growth and development. It's incredibly important that women are literate and educated, and it impacts the entire country and it impacts the family. So we're so happy to hear about the wonderful progress.\nBut barriers to access to education really vary from country to country. There is no one reason why girls aren't educated. It could be that there's a sheer difference in the values that families place in their sons over the daughters. Sometimes girls are married off very early, and they're expected to start having kids at a very young age. Some families believe that it's a better investment to have the girls stay at home and take care of household chores. It can really vary.\nThat's one of the reasons why with Let Girls Learn we focused on attacking these barriers from the ground up, really working through the Peace Corps. We have Peace Corps volunteers who are on the ground for several years getting to understand a community, working with local leaders, with parents themselves, working with the girls, and trying to figure out how to strategize at the local level to change perceptions. And this work is generational.\nI am optimistic that things have changed so much in Jordan, because the truth is, is that all the girls in that room, you all are the ones who are going to change the culture, because you're going to raise your girls with a different understanding of why education is important. And that's how change really happens. It happens in the family. It happens when fathers understand that a better investment than having your daughter milk the cow or to sweep a floor is to get them in school, and that increases their earning potential and it can have a tremendous impact on the financial security of that family. But it's going to be girls like you who are raising that next generation, who are going to start to change those stereotypes. And that's true for every girl around the world.\nSo we've got work to do. But with this improvement in literacy around the world, we're only going to see greater improvements and really critical changes in cultural norms and stereotypes.\nMS. SHAHIDI: Yes, well, to build off of that, I would have to say that my generation has inspired me so much because just like we can sit here right now and all talk to each other, and we're in different parts of the world, we're now so interconnected. And this entire generation, including all of my peers here and I'm sure everyone in that room, understands that importance of education. And just knowing that and supporting one another -- no matter how far away we are is so key. Because even to just know that there's somebody out there that's supporting you and wants you to succeed is important in your self-development and just knowing that you are supposed to be here. And you're supposed to be in the room where it happens, to quote \"Hamilton,\" my obsession. (Laughter.)\nBut also to -- quick story, and then it all makes sense. I was talking to my khale -- I'm half Iranian, and my khale, my great aunt was in town. And she was talking about her education. And she lived in Iran for most of her life and still goes back to visit. But she remembers just how crazy it was having to move to London at 17 to then go get a college degree. But she didn't go having already applied to a college. She moved to London at 17, and then had to go apply on her own and figure all these things out on her own. But when she did, she then created a midwife program and brought it back to Mashhad, Iran, where she's from. And just to see the impact that that made was so incredible on her community and on our community.\nAnd it really shows the importance of how one person can really make such a huge impact, and one person understanding the importance of education really changes the entire community. And it just goes from there.\nMS. LEIVE: In other words, Yara has your back. You guys are all part of an incredible sisterhood.\nI want to go to a group of girls in Peru. Peru and Jordan are nowhere near one another, and they have very different cultures with very different history. But they do face a lot of the same challenges. So I'd like to ask the students at the U.S. Embassy in Lima, Peru, to tell us a little bit about the way they're trying to get rid of some of these old-fashioned ideas that girls should not be educated.\nJouranlist Mavilla Huertes (ph) is with them. Mavilla?\nQ: Hi. I'm so excited for the opportunity to talk about our problems, our situation, about our life, dreams, girls. This morning we were talking about women and education, okay, but also about life, about change, about dreams.\nLet me see, 42 percent -- less than half -- of the girls in poor areas in Peru, far from the cities, finish high school. Why? Because they're families prefer boys are going to study. It's true now in 2016. That's the situation we are living.\nI'm with Maria Gracia (ph). Maria Gracia is a wonderful student from Chiclayo -- oh, my God, I'm so nervous.\nMRS. OBAMA: Don't be.\nQ: She has -- so interesting question for Yara.\nQ: Hello, everyone. My name is Maria Gracia, and I'm 18 years old. I enjoy swimming, cycling, and watching movies. I am currently studying economics, and I'm interested in diplomatic affairs. Last month I volunteered in the Asia Pacific Economic Operation Forum in the agriculture (inaudible) here in Peru. And it was a very enriching experience.\nMy dream is to make sure everyone in Peru has equal access to an education. So here in Peru, we have -- we face similar challenges as they do in Jordan. And for example, here many families think -- believe that young girls should stay home and take care of children or do housework. And even when girls and women find jobs, they get paid less than men. So I want to use my education to become a leader in Peru and help change the way people view the role of women and girls.\nSo my question is for Yara. Yara, how do you think girls should handle situations when people underestimate them or don't treat them as well because they're girls?\nMS. SHAHIDI: Well, that's a really good question. I would have to say first and foremost just being a teenager can be difficult in and of itself, and then given that there are certain limitations put onto female teenagers, or just being a girl, is unfair because we're all in the same boat of wanting to be educated and wanting to have opportunities based on our interests.\nI would have to say that when somebody underestimates you -- and I've been in that boat before -- it's more than -- what I realized about it was that it's more than trying to prove them wrong, but making sure that you prove yourself right, and make sure that you reaffirm your own beliefs and your own self-worth because overall that means more, and I feel like that gives you the drive. I think, while it's important to make sure that you have constructive conversations about why education is important to you to help change those minds, it's even more important to just continue with your dream. And I know that's easier said than done, and it sounds very theoretical, but know that there are people here, like I said before, supporting you. And that there are people that want you to be educated and when you want you to be educated, that's possibly the most powerful step.\nMS. LEIVE: Well, I don't know how often you get underestimated these days but it must have happened to you when you were young. How do you cope?\nMRS. OBAMA: It happened all the time, and that's one thing I want all these girls to know. When you look at me, you see me now as the First Lady, but there are still doubts. There are still people who question whether I would be a good First Lady, question whether I was strategic enough or whether my initiatives would have an impact. So all throughout my life, there are people who have underestimated me, as I'm sure they underestimate you.\nBut like Yara said, for me, I always use that as a challenge. The one way to get me to work my hardest was to doubt me. And I took that as, I will show you who I am. I remember my thesis advisor, who was a wonderful professor. And I know I was working on my senior thesis when I was at Princeton. And I had a great topic, and I was working pretty hard, but I wasn't working as hard as I could have. And I know I went to him for a letter of recommendation for law school. And he did one of the best things -- he was really honest. He said, you know, you're a good student but -- because I had gotten As in all his classes, by the way. But he said, are you the best thing I've seen coming out of the box? I'm not sure.\nAnd I didn't say a word. I went back to my dorm room, and for the next three months, I worked so hard on that thesis. I was in his office every day. We were on the floor working on questions. I just said -- instead of letting that deter me, I used it as a way to boost me to work harder. And he wrote me a letter of recommendation. I don't know what he said in that first letter. I accepted it. But later on, after a few months of working him, one day in the office, he looked up and he said, what are you doing after college? And I said, well, I'm applying to law school, you wrote me a letter of recommendation. And he was like, did I? (Laughter.) I said, yeah, you did. And it got quiet, and then he said, I think I'm going to write you another letter. And I said, okay. I got in. I don't know what that first letter said, but just by working harder and proving him wrong -- I didn't have to say a word. I didn't question his first opinion of me. I used it and I worked harder.\nThat's what these women and girls have to do. Sometimes we have to be better. Sometimes we have to work harder. Sometimes we have to work to combat those negative thoughts in our heads about who we are, and how we look, and what people think about us. So many of us, as women and girls, we are haunted by the voices of other people who tell us what we can't do. And it's something that you have to work on every single day. Every woman that you know is working on this. I am still working on it. And it takes being conscious of the fact that these voices are there, and they can hold you back. But you've got to push through them. Yara, are you jumping in on that one?\nMS. SHAHIDI: I guess what I'd have to say to add to that is, also understanding that the other voices in your head are also humans with flaws is important, and it's not these other perfect beings correcting you because you're an imperfect being. It's more so their opinion. And while opinions matter, at the same time, your own opinions are more important to your own development.\nI remember a teacher telling me that I was too direct in how I communicated. And it shook me to my core because I prided myself on this idea that I could communicate my thoughts with my teachers and that I could get my thoughts across perfectly. And then she was like, you know, people are going to think that you're being too fierce, too aggressive --\nMRS. OBAMA: Aggressive. That's the word that they've -- been used for me often. Too aggressive, too loud, too bossy.\nMS. SHAHIDI: Yeah. I think it challenged me, and what I realized is that it's okay to take up space. And that it's okay to take up the space around me unabashedly without the fear of being too loud or aggressive. That just means that I'm owning my space even more.\nMS. LIEVE: And you're talking about those words like \"aggressive\" and \"loud\" -- how do you reset that in your head? What do you reset it to?\nMRS. OBAMA: Well, aggressive is assertive. Loud is confidence. It's how you take those words. Maybe they were said to you, or about you, in a negative light, but you turn them around and you make them positive attributes. Because, let me tell you, to compete in school, in schools where boys are given the benefit of the doubt, you're going to have to be aggressive. And you've got to be confident. And there are times when you need to be loud and speak your mind. I've had to do that in every room of power that I've sat in, and I've had to learn that my voice has value. And if I don't use it, what's the point of me being in the room?\nAnd oftentimes what you find -- if you sit and listen, whether it's in a classroom or a boardroom or an office, you will hear men talk and talk and talk. And if you listen, many of them aren't saying anything. (Laughter.) They're just talking a lot. And once you realize that they're not saying anything more than what's going on in your head, then you start developing the courage to put your opinion right there on the table, right with them.\nSo I want girls around the world to understand that you're not alone when you hear these voices. These aren't new feelings. It's completely understandable. But it's you, and only you, that can drown those voices out. And another way to do that is to surround yourself by people who give you positive reinforcement. You have to learn how to, as we say here, ignore the haters. You got to keep them out of your life. You have to surround yourself by people who lift you up. And if it's one voice, keep that voice close to you.\nFor me, it was my parents -- my parents who didn't go to college, but they believed in me. They knew I was as smart as my brother. And those were the voices that I went home to and got refilled. My courage was reborn in my conversations with my parents. But if you don't have parents, find that friend, that neighbor, that mentor -- but you've got to feed yourself with positive energy, and work hard to keep the negative voices out of your life.\nMS. LEIVE: Yara, you look like you were about to jump in there when we were talking about the men at the table.\nMS. SHAHIDI: Well, one, I have to say, I have my chakra necklace on under this, just -- the importance of positive energy is so key. But also, I remember I was in speech and debate, and what was funny about it was that it was my first competition, and I was in there with my friend -- and I went to an all-girls Catholic school, so we were the only all-female team there.\nAnd the first person I was up against were two boys with really serious bowl cuts -- (laughter) -- and I remember going in, and I had lost all of the articles. And what was so interesting was, even though I had no articles to defend my argument, what they did was, even though we had a completely valid argument, was to say, but you're not reliable -- you're not a reliable debater. And basically they questioned whether or not I should even be in the room. And that really got to me.\nAnd I think when I finally analyzed that moment of why I lost, it was because they had the appearance of confidence, and I let them get to my confidence and break me down. So even though I knew that I was more than qualified and even though I knew that I had done so much research and that everything I said could be backed up, and it was a good source, they had gotten to the idea that, \"but you're a girl and you probably went on some random frilly site, and looked up these stats and they're not real.\" And then, keeping that in mind, I was even stronger in my next debate, where I was like, you're not going to get to me. And I now know that I could have a completely wack argument, but as long as I am saying it like this, you're going to believe me.\nMS. LEIVE: Yeah, that is a very persuasive tone of voice. Remember that in Peru. Thank you for that question.\nI want to move on to another topic. One of the biggest challenges that girls face globally is safety -- threats of war, kidnapping, rape, gangs, trafficking. And the physical difficulty of getting to school in environments like that can be so scary that many girls just simply decide they have no choice but to drop out. So we want to hear on that subject and others from students at the U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.\nSinger, rapper and VJ, Vanessa Mdee, is with girls in that country. Vanessa, hi. Can you tell us a little bit --\nMS. MDEE: Hi, how are you?\nMS. LEIVE: We're great here. Can you tell us a little bit about safety concerns in Tanzania, and how that changes life for girls and women there?\nMS. MDEE: Thank you, Cindi. Hey Michelle, you look great. Hi, Yara.\nMRS. OBAMA: Hey!\nMS. SHAHIDI: Hi!\nMS. MDEE: Okay. Thanks for joining us in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, East Africa. You're right -- a lot of young women and girls face very many safety concerns in this country. And it's unfortunate that they face, and they're most vulnerable, in their quest to better their lives. I'm seated with Nasra (ph) here, and she's going to give you more on this and also pose a question.\nQ: Hello. My name is Nasra Abdallah (ph) in Tanzania. I would like to start by thanking -- international and the U.S. Embassy for giving me this chance to talk with you, the First Lady of the world and the global students.\nMRS. OBAMA: I like that promotion. Thank you. (Laughter.)\nQ: I'm a student. (Inaudible.) I like reading novels and singing most of the time. My dream is to become a doctor. It is true that girls in Tanzania face a safety problem. First, it's due to the tradition of beliefs. Traditions really hinder the safety of the girls in Tanzania because there is this issue of female genital mutilation whereby the private body part of a girl is removed. Most of the girls die due to excessive bleeding in this activity. And others acquire diseases, such as HIV, because the tools used aren't sterilized. And the ones which are circumcised, most of them drop out of school, ready to be married, according to the tradition of -- so this really hinders the safety of the girls.\nAnd also, a long distance from home to school. This applies in all areas, rural and urban. Although in urban areas there are buses, but still there are some girls who walk. But along the way, there are gangsters, there are rebels. So most of the girls get raped. Others are raped and others are being attacked by thieves, whereby others get pregnant and drop out of school. So safety in Tanzania is still a huge problem for girls.\nAnother is early marriage, whereby parents marry girls in a very young age. At 12, you may find a girl already somebody's wife. Maybe (inaudible) wife in the age of 12. And this is due to the willingness of the parents for maybe, let's say, the bride price which is something they need. Or maybe it's to maintain family friendship -- just because my father is a friend of, let's say, Frank's father, so I'm supposed to get married to Frank so that they can maintain the friendship. So this is really hindering the safety of the girls in Tanzania.\nAnd also, I would like to pose a question to the Honorable First Lady of the world, Mrs. Obama. How do girls' safety in Africa and other countries inspire you to start Let Girls Learn? Thank you.\nMRS. OBAMA: Well, thank you. Thank you so much for sharing all of that information. It takes a level of courage and bravery to speak up and speak out, to talk about the challenges that are facing many girls in Africa and other parts of the world. And it's really stories like yours, stories like those that were the inspiration for me to start Let Girls Learn.\nHearing about people like Malala Yousafzai, who was shot in the head by terrorists who didn't believe that a girl should not only not get an education but speak out about the importance of girls getting educated; the girls in Nigeria that have been kidnapped for the sheer desire to get an education. There are stories like these all over the world, and they are heartbreaking.\nSo it was so important for me to hear these stories, to understand that we cannot tolerate millions and millions of girls being denied the access to improve themselves and the lives of their families by being essentially locked out of the education process. And that was really one of the primary reasons why we started Let Girls Learn.\nThe other thing I always try to point out to girls who lived in countries that do not have these issues, particularly in countries like the United States, where there are girls who drop out for less reasons, or they don't go to school, or they don't go to class, or they don't take their education seriously -- there are still millions of girls right here in this country and other parts of the world who take their education for granted, who look at the idea of access to free public education, which is what we have here in the United States, and they ignore it. They devalue it because they find other excuses, like my school isn't properly funded, or my teacher doesn't like me, or I just didn't feel well today.\nWe have our issues here in the United States. But I want kids here in the United States and in other parts of the world to understand that there are girls that are willing to give their life -- they are literally dying, trying to get the education that many of us take for granted.\nAnd if we really want to honor these girls, like Malala, and like the girls in Nigeria, and girls in Tanzania, who would give anything to get an education, then the very first thing we have to do is take our education seriously and not take it for granted, to be that voice. Because it's going to be up to the girls to get that education so they can be the fighters, and the champions, and the policymakers, and the next generation of world leaders who are going to make these changes.\nSo this is one of the reasons why we can't afford to ignore this issue, and we cannot afford to ever take our education for granted. Education is critical here in the United States and many parts of the world. And going to high school and going on to college is critical. And I want young girls to understand that, and to be as hungry for their education as these girls who would give anything to get theirs. We owe it to them to make that a reality. (Applause.)\nMS. LEIVE: Yara, do you connect with that, that idea that in this country we do tend to take for granted the fact that girls are entitled to an education, and a free one at that?\nMS. SHAHIDI: Definitely. I feel like we're definitely privileged in the fact that education -- it's a given that you will get an education. And so, so many times it's easy to say, I have so much chemistry homework, and, oh, my goodness, I'm taking four AP classes, what is my life, I don't have any time for myself -- versus understanding -- and I even had to take a moment to self-check, to understand, no, I'm allowed to take these AP classes and it's a privilege to take these AP classes, because then it gives me the ability to then go to the college of my choice and the ability to then choose the career of my choice.\nAnd it's a conversation that I have with my friends because it's so unfortunate that you have to risk your life for an education in places around the world -- and that's even a question, do I value my life and my education? The fact that you even have to think of those things is so insane. And so it's important, especially in areas in which education is a given, that we appreciate it and that we make sure that, with our education, we do the best to expand access and rights all around the world.\nMS. LIEVE: Well, thank you for that great question from Tanzania. I think we're all very impressed by your courage.\nI want to move on to another issue. We've talked a bit about gender stereotypes and some of the issues around safety. We touched before on confidence and self-esteem, and those are such important issues. As we all know, it's hard for anyone else to believe in you if you don't believe in yourself. So, luckily, we have some extremely confident students joining us from the UK -- girls from the Mulberry School and the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson School, both of which you visited, Mrs. Obama on your trips to London.\nMRS. OBAMA: Hi, ladies.\nMS. LEIVE: Ruth Wilson, the award-winning star of Showtime's, The Affair. I'm obsessed with that show -- we can talk about the plot later, Ruth. (Laughter.) Ruth is with those students right now.\nRuth, I know that you think self-esteem is an important and not just frivolous issue in this discussion. Why? Why does it matter to you?\nQ: Yeah, I was just talking to the girls earlier and I was saying that, as a kid, I was a major blusher. I mean I blushed all the time. When I was asked in school, I was asked questions, and I would go beetroot red. But I had, in my core, this very strong sense of self-belief. It was built from my family -- a very supportive family. It was built from having three older brothers that I needed to keep up with, and refused to be left behind. And it was built from an amazing education that allowed me and encouraged me to discover who I was and what I believed. And it also gave me these skills -- I needed to communicate my thoughts, my values, and my dreams.\nAnd I felt, as an actress and someone -- I kind of decided that core of self-belief, it gave me the courage to stand up and say to my mum and dad, at 21, I want to be an actor. It gave me the resilience to keep learning and keep growing and keep trying when I would get rejected at endless auditions and other things in my life. And it gave me the strength to stand up for things that I really believed in, both inside the industry and outside.\nAnd essentially, that sense of self-belief has enabled me to do the job that I've always dreamed of doing. So for me, self-confidence and self-empowerment is vital to having a voice in your life and in the job that you choose.\nAnd I'm sitting next to a deeply inspiring young woman, Ayesha (ph.) She is president of the Feminist Society at her school. And she's also just participated in Women of the World Festival, where she spoke out about inspiring young women. So I'm going to hand over to Aisha.\nQ: Good afternoon, Mrs. Obama. Thank you for letting us take part in this discussion. I'm Ayesha. I'm 17 years old, and I am a proud British feminist. So self-empowerment is very important. The world spends so much time telling us who we can't be and what we can't do. There is a need for strong self-belief, to push back against the pressures, and we need to realize all the potential that we have.\nI find empowerment in my education. My school is a place where I can explore who I am and develop my beliefs. I am chair of our school's Feminist Society, and I work with wonderful school staff to help design programs with guest speakers so that we can learn about what's possible from other successful women.\nI was at Mulberry when you came to visit, Mrs. Obama, and I was so moved by what you had to say to us. You told us about your start in life and how it was extremely similar to ours. You described how you had grown up in a neighborhood a lot like this one. We learned a lot that day, and, most importantly, we learned that girls who go to school in London have a duty to utilize the skills and opportunities that we are given, and make a stand for all the sisters around the world who are denied a right to education.\nWe face our own challenges going to school here, believe it or not, and Tower Hamlets is one of the boroughs that has a lot of deprivation in it. However we are fortunate enough to have access to a high-quality education and schools that nurture our confidence and creativity as well as our academic achievement.\nSixty-two million girls around the world are, unfortunately, denied an education. Mulberry and Elizabeth Garrett Anderson have been given a gift, and your visit, Mrs. Obama, inspired us to share that gift with girls across the world.\nAfter your visit, the student body worked very hard to work out how we could support Let Girls Learn. We came up with an idea. In April 2017, we will be a launching a girls leadership camp called Girls Leading. This is a residential event to bring together a community of girls from across the UK. Many will be from disadvantaged backgrounds. We will help them learn self-confidence and become effective leaders. At Girls Leading, campers will apply their leadership skills to support the work of Let Girls Learn in increasing the access to education for all girls around the world.\nMrs. Obama, is this what you had in mind when you came to visit Mulberry? (Laughter.)\nMRS. OBAMA: Oh, my goodness. That is. Yes, absolutely. You all have exceeded my expectations.\nAnd let me just say that my visits to both of your schools, oh, I love you all so much. I've been following everything you've done. You all touched my heart in a way that I can't imagine. Your stories, all of your stories, and my time with you was also a part of what helped to shape Let Girls Learn, and to help me envision this sort of worldwide community of strong women and girls helping each other, and doing things like developing leadership programs, and raising awareness about the plight of girls around the world who can't go to school, and being powerful voices and individuals in their own right, to be able to stand up in their schools and in their families and their communities, and have a voice and push an agenda forward.\nSo I am so, so proud of all of you amazing young women. And this is really part of the point of Let Girls Learn. We have the power as women and girls, right now, today, to change the circumstances for these millions of girls around the world. We all have a voice. We all have the ability to develop leadership opportunities, or find ways within our own lives and our own schools and our communities to have an impact on this issue.\nAnd if, at the very least, we take care to make sure that we're doing everything we can for ourselves as individuals -- to be strong, prepared, educated, outspoken, confident young women -- to continue to work on ourselves every day, and do it without apology, without embarrassment, to invest in ourselves as women, and to continue to do that throughout our lives.\nOlder women like us, sometimes we have to remind ourselves that it's okay to invest in us -- to invest in our health, to invest in our continued growth, to push ourselves beyond our comfort zones. We were not put on this Earth just to be good mothers or good wives; we were here to be good citizens and good individuals. And that takes investment. And I want girls to start practicing that at a very early age -- not being so selfless that they can't look out for themselves.\nSo, to all of you there, thank you. Thank you for being that inspiration for me. You should look at what you've done. Let Girls Learn has now raised millions of dollars; it's having an impact. And look at what we're doing here. We're having a worldwide conversation with young women around the globe. This was a vision -- and I'm so grateful to Cindy and to the Glamour team for making this happen.\nThis is just a taste of what we can do. Young girls, as you all said, we have access to social media. We've got Skype, we've have all of these tools. Use them. Use them to educate yourselves and to reach out to girls around the world. Don't just Snapchat what you're eating. (Laughter.) Use that tool to impart knowledge, to share wisdom, to just share your stories and spread the word. Because this conversation should lead to millions of conversations just like this happening around the world forever. This is the beginning of something huge.\nSo I know we can do it, and I know it's something that I'm going to spend the rest of my life working on. So I'm going to need a lot of soldiers out there like all of you -- (applause)\n-- to help me make this happen.\nMS. LEIVE: In other words, this issue does not go away for you in mid-January.\nMRS. OBAMA: Not even.\nMS. LEIVE: All right. All right. Glad to hear that.\nOn that topic of confidence, I want to hear what the girls here in D.C. are doing to make themselves feel confident and strong. What makes you girls feel like you? And if we can go to Rowan in the audience to kick up off there. What's your take on that?\nMS. BLANCHARD: Self-confidence I found through other girls; I found through sisterhood. Oftentimes, the things that we're sold -- there was a parallel recently of two magazines. One was a boys teen magazine and one was a girls teen magazine. And on the cover of the girls teen magazine it said, \"Wake Up Pretty.\" And on the cover of the boys teen magazine it said, \"Choose Your Own Adventure.\"\nSo I think it was important for me, and it's been important for me to find sisterhood and to find other girls who were encouraging me. And that's right here. That's being able to Skype these girls. It's what Mrs. Obama was saying about having these channels where we're able to reach out and have an audience, and able to influence them and to connect with people.\nAnd Paradise, here, is a perfect example of that. And she's going to talk about how her after-school program influenced her to stay in school and follow her dreams.\nQ: Hi, I'm Paradise. I'm from New York City. I'm here with the Lower Eastside Girls Club, which is a program for girls that teaches them things from exploring astronomy to building and programming Arduinos. This has taught me, my friends here, and so many other girls a lot about different careers they can have when they get older. So I'm very lucky to have a program like the Lower Eastside Girls Club, but not all girls have access to these kinds of opportunities such as being here today.\nSo my question for Yara is how did access to the arts and theater, like your acting, help you understand how important school is, and keep you grounded in your effort to get a degree?\nMS. SHAHIDI: Well, such a great question. But I would have to say that I got interested in arts and theater as a result of how much I loved to read. And for me, television and movies was the result or the -- my favorite book of mine coming to fruition and coming to life. And for me, it was reading Baldwin in class, and reading Sandra Cisneros in class, and reading Zora Neale Hurston, and seeing that they're these powerful women, they're these powerful women of color, and their stories are being appreciated by everybody in my class, and how universal that story was. And then I felt like it was then my job as the actor to then bring that story to life, and all sorts of stories to life.\nAnd for me, just being an actor has really given me the ability to -- or not ability, but the curiosity -- to fully understand other people's conditions and other people's lives. And from that, it gave me a general curiosity that school helped fill. And for me, being in history class and being able to write an essay on whether or not we should celebrate Columbus Day; or being in math class and understanding that, while I may not ever measure the tree based on the length of its shadow, I now understand critical thinking skills. (Laughter.) I just did that yesterday. (Laughter.)\nAnd I realized that I had to look at the bigger picture. So many times I can get caught up in the small things of when will I ever use this little detail? When will I ever have to learn about King Henry's cousin's wife's child? And it's really more about being able to analyze the world around you. And that's what acting taught me, too. It was an applicable version of everything that I was learning.\nAnd there's a Baldwin quote that I will very loosely paraphrase -- loosely, I repeat -- in which he says that the paradox of education is that once you get an education you begin to analyze the society that you're in and the society educating you. And what's so powerful about that is just this idea that when we educate ourselves we then turn around to make our society a better place, and we then realize that our system can be improved. And it is this continuous cycle of self-improvement. And while we may never reach the perfect education system, there is this hope and there is this essential part of our education system that basically says that everybody in this generation that will then graduate, or anybody who then tries to further their education turns around and says, how can I help the next generation and how can I make the system better.\nMRS. OBAMA: Wow. I'm going to write your letter of recommendation. (Laughter.) Got it. Got it. It's done. In fact, I think I'm just going to send this video to every school that you apply to. (Laughter.)\nMS. LEIVE: You talked about connecting with the characters in the books that you read. And that's about empathy and how art and education really open up our empathy.\nAnd I'm curious, Mrs. Obama, about books that you read whether you were growing up --\nMRS. OBAMA: Oh, yeah.\nMS. LEIVE: And what were the books that opened those doors for you?\nMRS. OBAMA: My absolute favorite novel of all time is Song of Solomon -- Toni Morrison. I've read that book three times. And I've tried to make my daughters read it over and over again. It's a phenomenal book. But every time you read it you just uncover something else, deeper, about each character, about the words that are used and the words that -- it was my first major experience in how words, beautifully written, can capture a person's imagination. It can pull them in. It can lock them in, in a way that is indescribable. So that, by far, is my favorite book.\nBut that's the beauty of education. And here's the thing. High schools sometimes can be a little tough because you are studying things that are not necessarily relevant to you -- right? Measuring the shadow of a tree, or whatever the heck you're doing. (Laughter.) I'm glad I'm not doing that anymore. (Laughter.) But the point is, is that you get through high school to get to college. And college is just this beautiful thing that I just wish every kid could have access to because that's really the place when you can dig deep into the things that you care so much about. You can spend hours reading and studying things that you are really curious about. And you don't have to do the shadow and the tree measurements if you don't want to. You can go deep.\nCollege is also this place where you're surrounded by people just like you, your age. You will never again have an opportunity to live independently -- if you get to live in a dorm -- and spend your time with other people of both genders who have the same interests as you. You don't get to do that as a grownup. You don't get to do that as a parent.\nEducation is a luxury that you should be working towards because it is a really cool thing. And I wish that everybody was as hungry for that privilege as they were trying to get on Snapcha,t or do whatever the heck you all do. Because education is really where great things happen. It's where your mind opens up. It's where you mature. It's like -- I think someone once put it, for them, college was like \"the training wheels to life.\" And it really is. It gives you the chance to make some mistakes and not totally fall flat on your face. You've got professors who care about you.\nSo I want to make college exciting. I want you to understand how exciting this can be. So you're just getting through high school to get to the really fun stuff, and you never want to make that mistake of dropping out or being discouraged in high school, letting somebody throw you off of your game where you don't get to that ultimate goal, the real prize, the freedom of college.\nBut there are millions of girls who don't even have that opportunity. And that's what we're talking about. For the girls who do, for the girls who live in developed countries where these opportunities are there, do no squander this. Make this your reality, make this your life's goal. There is nothing more important that you can do for yourself than getting your education. Take it from me. I wouldn't be here if it weren't for mine.\nMS. LEIVE: I'm seeing here that girls from Cambodia are tuning in. And they have a question for both Mrs. Obama and for Yara.\nSaporan (ph) writes: \"My name is Saporan. I live in Takeo Province in Cambodia, and I'm 17 years old. In many of our communities, parents don't see a daughter's education as a priority, especially when compared to their sons. They believe that domestic duties are more valuable for girls. How do you address that in your lives?\"\nSo this is a similar issue that we talked about before. But really the question is, do some of those same prejudices and stereotypes hold true even in this country? And how do you cope?\nMS. SHAHIDI: I feel like they most definitely hold true. And it's something funny that we run into all the time in television, in which you get these characters that basically can fill a gender stereotype of, like, yes, you'll be the side, peripheral teenager only on your phone, and you will never be engaged. (Laughter.) And you're just going to walk right through the room.\nMS. LEIVE: Why do I feel like you've read a lot of those scripts? (Laughter.)\nMS. SHAHIDI: Yes, I have. And these stereotypes hold true to all sorts of different pieces of our identity -- so as a teenager, as a girl, as a person of color. And what's so interesting about it is that I, even with my character Zoey, had to prove -- I have to start by saying this is a very privileged experimentation that I had here in figuring out how to expand my character and how she would be more representative of true human nature. And that was through throwing my phone in the middle of a scene, because I was going to be engaged in this conversation, especially given that in this episode somebody was choking on our counter. I was like, I don't think I'd be on my phone right now.\nAnd part of it is just by understanding and appreciating that we're all full humans. And while it may have -- I think being the practical person that I am and the person that's so obsessed with history, I always break it down to how our society has evolved, and how sometimes as soon as we became a hunting-gathering society, then there was this need for domestic work because all of a sudden it was like not everybody could do this work. So understand this work was so difficult that they had to find people to go do this work.\nAnd so it wasn't from this place of, well, I guess this is all you're worth, and you're only worth going into -- it's more than, oh, you belong in the house. It's basically understanding that we are so powerful and we are so special and important that we can do more than that and that we have evolved. We are an evolved society. And we have gone past those days. So rather than being the person in the house, I'm going to be the person that creates the technology to make all the housework easier.\nMS. LEIVE: Oh, that sounds great. Do that.\nWe have time for one last question from one of our watch parties. This is from the one that's happening at the Chattanooga School for the Arts and Sciences, right here in the U.S. Eleven-year-old Kendal (ph), who is watching with her sixth grade class, heard from the girls in Tanzania and wants to know if you could tell girls in the U.S. one thing about life in Tanzania, what would it be? What do you want American girls to know about Tanzania?\nSo, Tanzania, what would that one thing be?\nQ: Thank you for that question. Before we answer her question, I just want to point out that before we went live we were speaking on what you said about these systems, our education structures, and how we feel like sometimes we have an overload of work. And I couldn't answer that better that the goal is to get to college. So thank you for just answering that straight on. That's amazing.\nI've got Esther with me right now who is going to answer the question from Tennessee. So, Esther, take the mic.\nQ: Hey, hello, Michelle.\nMRS. OBAMA: Hi, sweetie. How are you?\nQ: I'm fine. Thank you for giving me this opportunity. I'm Esther from Ruba Girls High School (ph). I'm 18 years of age. And I'm a Tanzanian girl born in a family of five children.\nWell, before coming to Ruba Girls High School, I used to study Mabini High School (ph), which is a day school. I had to walk a very long distance to get to school. And when I woke up in the morning, it had to be very early in the morning so that I would get to school. Sometimes I had to face challenges on the way, such as the bus conductors were on strike and it was hard to get to the bus. And students were not well considered because we're paying less than the parents.\nOne thing I would like to tell the girls in the U.S. is that we need to stick to education because through education you get that bigger dream, the dream of being very big leaders in the world. For example, taking myself as an example, I'm the head girl in my school. I'm having the dream of being a very big leader in the future. So by becoming the head girl, I think that in the future I may become more than even the head girl.\nSo, girls, through this bigger dream, we can make it better than here. So I would like to tell the girls they should stick to education, and education is the only passport to their future, since the future belongs to those who prepare for it today.\nSo in Tanzania education, we face challenges, but you should never let this (inaudible.) We should face challenges and learn how to overcome those challenges, because what doesn't kill you, makes you stronger. Thank you. (Applause.)\nMRS. OBAMA: Well said.\nMS. LEIVE: So, Mrs. Obama, Yara, this was a thrill to have you with us today. I wonder if before we close, you can just leave us with one thought. You've got teenagers all around the world, teenage girls watching. If you can go back and tell your 16-year-old or 15-year-old self one thing -- I know that's ancient history for you, yes.\nMRS. OBAMA: -- like yesterday. (Laughter.)\nMS. LEIVE: Yes, if you could tell your 16-year-old self one thing, one piece of advice, what would it be?\nYara?\nMS. SHAHIDI: Well, one, that education is so much more than the grade. But it is about access to experiences and access to the ability to pursue your dream.\nAnd for me I would have to say that Yara, don't stress out about chemistry. You'll end up getting great grades in it anyway. And also that we have a lot of work to do, Yara. And it's more than just finishing this class, but making sure other people have the ability to finish the classes that they want to finish.\nMRS. OBAMA: My advice to girls is always this -- and this is what I tell my daughters every day -- do not be afraid to fail, because that oftentimes is the thing that keeps us as women and girls back, because we think we have to be right. We think we have to be perfect. We think that we can't stumble. And the only way you succeed in life, the only way you learn is by failing. It's not the failure; it's what you do after you fail. Do you let it each you up? Do you quit? Do you give up? Or do you let it bolster you? Does it serve as the challenge in your mind to do more, to take some risks, to step outside of your comfort zone?\nAnd the last thing that I do want to say to all girls is that be supportive of each other. I just can't say this enough. We have to be our best friends -- each other. That means we cannot be catty. We cannot compete and see one person's failure as our success. We can all rise together. We can all win.\nAnd we're sometimes taught in our societies that we have to compete and we have to hold each other back in order for one of us to succeed. That is not true. We need each other. And all over the world, we have to be a team of women and girls who love each other and value each other and cherish one another. Because if we don't cherish each other, no one else will.\nSo let's start there and start working together, and find a way that we're going to lift up some other girl in our lives. Maybe it's a little sister, a neighbor. But you can be a mentor today. So do that. Do that work now. Get in the habit of that.\nAll right? You all with me? You all have to be my soldiers in this, right? (Applause.)\nMS. SHAHIDI: If anyone ever needs a pep talk, find me on Twitter. I am so good at pep talks.\nMS. LEIVE: So you heard that. We're on a team and Mrs. Obama is on the team with us way past January.\nMRS. OBAMA: That's right. I'm going to be here. And I'm going to be looking for each and every -- I want to hear the stories of what you've done. I want you to tweet, text, whatever the heck you do. (Laughter.) I'll find a way to hear from you. But I want to hear about the stories that come from these conversations. So I'm looking forward to it.\nMS. LEIVE: Well, we need to get you off the stage to write Yara's college recommendation. That's important work. (Laughter.) They are really talking about this.\nThat is all the time we have. I want to thank the students around the world for participating in this global conversation honoring the International Day of the Girl.\nI also want to thank our phenomenal friends here in D.C., Rowan Blanchard, Yara Shahidi, and First Lady Michelle Obama. (Applause.) Or as she was called earlier in the program, First Lady of the World Michelle Obama. (Laughter.)\nRemember that you can always find out more about Let Girls Learn at letgirlslearn.gov and the Girl Project at Glamour.com.\nHere's to the power of girls not just today, but every day. Thank you.

We are very thrilled to have you all here today on the International Day of the Girl for the debut screening of \"We Will Rise.\" Oh, my goodness, I can't believe we are here. (Laughter.) It's a good thing.\nI want to thank a few people. Meryl, you can share this position. (Laughter.) If only I had known that eight years ago! (Laughter.) We could have shared this whole experience, you and me. (Laughter.) But Meryl, obviously, the great Meryl Streep has just devoted her not-a-lot-of time to this project. And she is a delightful -- she is delightful and is intelligent and is focused and engaged -- as you would imagine Meryl Streep to be. That's what I tell everybody. Meryl Streep is exactly as awesome as you would imagine Meryl Streep to be. (Applause.)\nOh, and Andra. Oh, gosh. Let's just -- (applause) -- Andra comes, hangs out all the time. We're always asking her to sing -- \"Can you sing again? Can you come back?\" And she's like, yes, of course. But almost every time -- every other time, I miss you singing. And I'm so glad -- you take my breath away, not just with your music and your voice, but with your spirit, which is as pure as your voice is. So, Andra, thank you for lending your talent to this project. (Applause.)\nAnd in addition to Meryl, I had a couple of other partners in crime in this project -- Freida, Freida Pinto, who could not be here today. But she was amazing. You'll see how hard she has worked on this project. Isha, of course. (Applause.) She is just terrific. (Applause.) She was trying to pass as the third Obama child -- (laughter) -- as she told me back there. And I was like, you are welcome any time. (Laughter.)\nTo Jeff, thank you. To the Doc Group, thank you all. Amy, thank you so much for this work. My dear friend, Virginia Moseley, who -- there she goes. We are all -- we're bemoaning the fact that our daughters are gone and away from us. So this is a good distraction, right? Don't you think, a good project? (Laughter.)\nBut to everyone else at CNN and elsewhere who helped make this remarkable documentary possible -- see Diane Warren there as well. I'm going to call you out because -- \"This is For My Girls,\" the writer of the song that we made popular in \"Carpool Karaoke.\" (Laughter.) And it was actually Diane's idea that we do \"Carpool Karaoke.\" She's like, you've got to do \"Carpool Karaoke.\" I'm like, really? (Laughter.) She's like, it's going to be a hit, I guarantee you. And I was like, I guess she was right. (Laughter.)\nBut this is really a dream come true for me, this documentary. And I'm so grateful to all of you for making this possible. I know it was a lot of hard work, a lot of passion, love and dedication. But I'm so grateful.\nAnd of course, I want to especially honor the girls we have, the young ladies here today. (Applause.) We have the young women from Liberia and Morocco who had the courage to share their stories and who are truly the stars of this film and this day. Having you all here, bringing you physically here, was always a part of this vision. So I'm grateful to everyone -- all the embassies, all of the supporters who have made it possible for you guys to be here, not just here to screen the movie, but you're going to get to see Washington. And you've done so many things, and I understand you're already bonding. And this is part of that girl-power network, this is how we rise up together. So maintain those connections as you go through this. (Applause.)\nBut having these girls -- that's what Let Girls Learn is about. It's about telling the stories of these girls and girls like them across the globe -- not just their challenges and their struggles, but their dreams and their aspirations -- which are big. Their unrelenting bravery and determination -- yes, I'm talking about you all -- the miles they have to walk each day just to get to school. The hours they spend each night studying, making their families proud. Their refusal to give up, even in the face of some overwhelming odds that would stifle many of us.\nBecause since we launched Let Girls Learn, time and again we have seen that whether it's a head of state, a corporate CEO, or a teenage girl here in the U.S., when people hear your stories -- the stories of girls who aren't in school -- they're moved, and they're outraged. And, better yet, they want to help. And that was certainly true for me.\nThese girls, and girls like them, are my inspiration. I carry their stories with me every single day. And it was a privilege to bring my mother and my daughters with me to Liberia and Morocco and -- for them to get to meet you. And that was our very last trip together during our time in the White House, so it was special for so many different reasons. Because while we represent three different generations, each of us -- my mom, my daughters, myself -- we saw ourselves in these young women that we met -– in their passion, and their intellect, and their resolve. And I hope that this movie about their lives will serve as a call to action. I hope that people around the world will be as inspired as I am to step up and to speak out on behalf of girls around the world who struggle to go to school.\nSo many of you in this room have already answered that call, and for that I am grateful -- making powerful commitments from your companies and your organizations, serving in agencies across the federal government that are driving our girls' education efforts. That's why you all are here. And I am so, so incredibly grateful to all of you for everything that you've done to give so many girls the opportunities they need to fulfill what we know are their boundless potential.\nSo I am excited about this moment, this time. I haven't seen the film at all. I've seen a clip here or there. I know Meryl has been checking it twice. (Laughter.) So I'm as excited as everyone to see this movie. So with that, I'm going to stop talking so that we can hear directly from some of these girls and learn about their amazing stories.\nSo it is now my pleasure and my honor to present to you: \"We Will Rise.\"", "timestamp": "2016-10-11", "title": "Remarks by the First Lady at a Screening of the CNN Documentary \"We Will Rise\""}
{"author": "Michelle Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=120953", "text": "First Lady Michelle Obama: This issue is personal for me\nFor me, education has never been simply a policy issue – it's personal. Neither of my parents and hardly anyone in the neighborhood where I grew up went to college. But thanks to a lot of hard work and plenty of financial aid, I had the opportunity to attend some of the finest universities in this country. That education opened so many doors and gave me the confidence to pursue my ambitions and have a voice in the world. For me, education was power.\nAnd a few years ago, when I had the honor of meeting Malala Yousafzai, who was shot in the head just for trying to go to school, this issue got really personal for me. I saw that the terrorists who nearly killed her were trying silence her voice, snuff out her ambitions, and take away her power.\nThat's why I decided to work on global girls' education as First Lady: because right now, there are tens of millions of girls like Malala in every corner of the globe who are not in school -- girls who are so bright, hardworking and hungry to learn. And that's really the mission of the Let Girls Learn initiative we launched last year – it's a global effort to give these girls the education they need to fulfill their potential and lift up their families, communities and countries.\nNow, as First Lady, I have no budget of my own for programs, and I have no authority to make or pass laws. That's why, when we first launched Let Girls Learn, many folks doubted that we could make a real impact on this global issue.\nBut over the past year and a half, we've established partnerships with some of the world's largest companies and organizations that are committing money, resources and expertise. We're collaborating with countries like Canada, Mexico and the Nordic countries on girls' education efforts. Countries like Japan, South Korea, and the UK have collectively pledged nearly $600 million. The United States is investing over a billion dollars through new and ongoing efforts and running Let Girls Learn programs in more than 50 countries. The World Bank Group will be investing $2.5 billion over the next five years. And through social media campaigns, Let Girls Learn has rallied people across America and across the globe to step up and be champions for girls worldwide.\nAll of this is happening because time and again, whether it's a head of state, a corporate CEO, or a 15-year-old girl here in the U.S., when people hear the stories of girls who aren't in school, they want to help.\nThat's why CNN's new film on global girls' education, \"We Will Rise,\" airing for the first time this week, is so critically important – because it tells these girls' stories.\nThis powerful film chronicles the lives of some of the girls I visited this past summer in Liberia and Morocco, two countries in Africa where many girls struggle to get an education. I was joined in my travels by the actors and activists Meryl Streep and Freida Pinto, who are also passionate about girls' education, as well as CNN anchor Isha Sesay.\nTogether, we sat down with girls in both countries to discuss the barriers they face and the dreams they hold for their futures. Like so many girls around the world, many of these girls come from families struggling with poverty. Some endure dangerous commutes to and from school each day. Others face cultural pressures to drop out, marry young and start having children of their own.\nBut these girls have big plans for their lives. They want to attend college and become doctors, teachers, engineers, entrepreneurs; and day after day, they do whatever it takes to get the education they need to fulfill their dreams. They get up before dawn, and spend hours harvesting crops, cooking for their families and tending to their younger siblings before heading to class. After school, they work as maids and in factories, and they study for hours late into the night.\nI hope you will be as moved by their stories as I was – and I hope you'll visit LetGirlsLearn.Gov to learn more about how you can take action to help girls like them worldwide go to school.\nUnlike so many girls around the world, we have a voice. That's why, particularly on this International Day of the Girl, I ask that you use yours to help these girls get the education they deserve. They're counting on us, and I have no intention of letting them down. I plan to keep working on their behalf, not just for the rest of my time as First Lady, but for the rest of my life. I hope you will join me.", "timestamp": "2016-10-11", "title": "Op-Ed Article by the First Lady on CNN.com"}

Hey, North Carolina! Oh, this is a good-looking crowd! Now, I think I've got to take off my jacket. This is a—we've got some work to do. How you all been? It's good to be in North Carolina.\nLet me begin by saying what an honor it was to have Judge Frye introduce me here today, the extraordinary work that he has done.\nAudience member. We love you!\nThe President. I love you back. I do. I love North Carolina. I do. I always used to say, in North Carolina, people are so nice. In North Carolina, even the folks who didn't vote for me are still nice to me. [Laughter] I mean I—just some good people in North Carolina.\nWe've also got a number of outstanding elected officials who are proud to work for you each and every day. Your Representatives in Congress: Alma Adams is here. G.K. Butterfield is in the house. David Price is here. And your next United States Senator, Deborah Ross, is here. And although he couldn't be here this evening, I just want to mention your outstanding candidate for Governor, Roy Cooper. He is a good man, and he deserves your support. He is outstanding.\nNow, those of you who have seats, feel free to sit down. If you don't have a seat, don't sit; you'll fall. [Laughter] But you don't have to. I'm just saying, your feet might get tired. I'm going to talk for a little bit.\nHurricane Matthew\nI want to begin by thanking everybody in North Carolina for looking out for one another these past few days. As all of you know, a lot of communities are dealing with terrible flooding. Lives have been lost. And so the entire country has been thinking about North Carolina. Thoughts and prayers are with folks who are still dealing with rivers that are overflowing, homes that are being flooded. We made sure that FEMA was on the ground early.\nAudience member. Thank you! Thank you!\nThe President. We've been making sure that the Governor, local and State officials all have what North Carolina needs to recover and rebuild.\nAnd it is a reminder of what we do here in America, which is, we have to look out for one another no matter what. But when it comes to making sure that people are safe and cared for, there are no politics. Everybody has to look out for one another.\n2016 Presidential and Congressional Elections\nNow, this will probably be one of the last times I get to visit as President.\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. It's okay. I'm going to come back more when I'm not President. Now I'm just allowed to come on business. I'm coming for fun in North Carolina next time I come. But our term is coming to an end. Michelle and I—our lease was only for 8 years. And we're already looking around making sure we haven't broken any china—[laughter]—or messed anything up, Bo and Sunny haven't ruined any of the carpets because we want to get our security deposit back. [Laughter] You've been through that, right? Sometimes, these landlords, they'll look. They'll be like, look, oh——\nAudience member. Bill Clinton's a rapist! Bill Clinton's a rapist! Bill Clinton's a rapist!\nThe President. Oh no!\n[At this point, two audience members wearing T-shirts with an anti-Clinton slogan walked in front of the podium and then exited the venue.]\nAudience members. Boo!\nAudience members. Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!\nThe President. You know, this is the great thing about politics in America. It just—it takes all kinds. [Laughter] Folks will just do all kinds of stuff. Now, where was I? See, those are some folks who were—they were auditioning for a reality show. [Laughter]\nAll right, all right. Hold on a second. Settle down, everybody. Settle down. Goodness gracious. I'm just trying to make a simple point here. [Laughter]\nI wanted to say thank you for all the support that you've given us over the years. And I remember campaigning here in Greensboro 8 years ago.\nIt was in the closing days of another hard-fought campaign. We were still mired in two wars, living through the early days of what would end up being the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes. We were tackling challenges like health care and climate change that we had been putting off for a long time, and we had just been kicking the can down the road for way, way too long.\nAnd when we look back 8 years later, we fought back from the recession. Our auto industry is setting new records: our businesses have turned job losses into 15 million new jobs; cut our unemployment rate in half; slashed our dependence on foreign oil; doubled our production of clean energy; incomes are rising; poverty is falling; uninsured rate at an alltime low; across America, you can marry whoever you love; brought our brave troops home to their families; delivered justice to Usama Bin Laden; shut down Iran's nuclear weapons program; opened a new chapter with the people of Cuba; brought nearly 200 nations together around a climate agreement that might save this beautiful planet for future generations; America viewed more positively around the world; setting the global agenda on the challenges of our times.\nWe—no wonder I've gone gray, because we've been busy. We've been busy. That's why I've got all this gray hair.\nAudience member. You look good, baby! You look good, baby!\nThe President. I've been busy. But Michelle says I still look good though. That's what she says. That's what she tells me. Now, my daughters, on the other hand, they—what did they say? They said, well, you're dad cute. [Laughter] You're, like, cute for a dad—[laughter]—which is—that's the best you're going to do. So that's all right.\nBut I am telling you, Greensboro, all that progress goes out the window if we don't make the right choice just 4 weeks from today. The closer we get, the clearer the choice becomes. It's a choice between—is somebody hollering again? Audience members. Yes!\nThe President. You know what. Here's the deal: Try to get your own rally! Try to get you own rally! You've got to get your own rally. [Laughter] See, if you can't get your own rally, don't come mess up somebody else's rally. We've got work to do here.\nWe've got a choice right now between somebody who is as qualified as has ever run for the office of President and somebody who, over and over again, has proven himself unfit to represent this country.\nLook, Democrats and Republicans, we've always had our differences. That's the nature of a democracy. There is nothing wrong with that. When I was running against John McCain, when I was running against Mitt Romney, we had serious disagreements on the economy and on foreign policy and on social issues. And those elections were close and contested. And we had debates. But the truth is, although, obviously, I believed that the agenda that we set was the better agenda for America, I never thought that those people were not honorable. I did not think that they would—if they were in the Oval Office that America would spin out of control. I didn't think that they couldn't represent us on the world stage. I just thought they represented a different political party and a different philosophy.\nBut look—and I'm being honest here—that is not the case with the current Republican nominee. He doesn't have the temperament or the judgment or the knowledge or, apparently, the desire to obtain the knowledge or the basic honesty that a President needs to have. And that was true even before we heard about his attitudes towards women.\nAudience members. Yes!\nThe President. Now, of course, it was true when we heard what he thought about minorities and what he thought about people of the Muslim faith and when he made fun of disabled persons or when he insulted Gold Star families. But you don't have to be a husband or a father——\nAudience member. Preach!\nThe President. ——to hear what we heard just a few days ago and say, that's not right. You just have to be a decent human being to say, that's not right. And if it makes you mad, if you say that's not somebody I want representing the United States of America, you can do something about it, North Carolina. Go to iwillvote.com, register to vote right away, and make your voice be heard.\nAudience members. That's right! That's right!\nAudience member. I will vote!\nThe President. Early voting starts next Thursday. And you can reject a dark and pessimistic vision of a country where we turn against each other——\nAudience member. You know it!\nThe President. ——and turn away from our role as leaders in the world. You can reject fear and resentment and blame and anger and hate and choose the America we know: an America that's full of courage and optimism and generosity and ingenuity.\nYou know what, we've got real challenges. Families are still struggling to pay the bills, for all the progress we've made. Young people are still worried about paying off student loans or starting a career. There—even with Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, there are still folks who don't have health care.\nAudience member. That's right!\nThe President. There are still kids who are worried about their safety. And everybody is frustrated with political gridlock, and people are worried about racial division. There are pockets of America that still haven't recovered from factory closures. There are still young people who wonder whether they'll have the same opportunities that we had. But I tell you, I've traveled to every State in this Union over these last 8 years, and I've talked to tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of people. And what I've seen consistently, and what I see right here in North Carolina, is what's right about America.\nAudience member. That's right!\nThe President. I see people working hard. And I see people starting businesses. And I see people teaching kids. And I see people serving our country. And I see folks who are inventing new products and services and doctors coming up with new cures. And I see young people all across this country of every color and every background and every faith who are full of energy and ideas and are not going to be held back by what is, because they want to seize what could be, what ought to be. And I see Americans of every background and every faith who believe that we are stronger together—young, old, Black, White, Latino, Asian, Native American, folks with disabilities, men and women—all pledging allegiance to that same proud flag.\nThat's the America I know. And there's only one candidate in this race who shares those beliefs and who has devoted her life to it—a mom and a grandma who will do anything to make sure our children thrive; a leader with real plans to blast down barriers and break through glass ceilings and widen the circle of opportunity for every single American. And that is the next President of the United States of America, Hillary Clinton! That's who needs to succeed me in this office.\nNow, if there's one thing I can tell you, Greensboro, it's—and I said this at the convention—nobody fully understands, including me, the demands of this job until you've actually sat behind the desk.\nI thought I knew, but once—when you're there, suddenly, it's like, oh! [Laughter] Oh, the buck stops here. [Laughter]\nAnd so, like, tweeting doesn't qualify you. [Laughter] Sound bites don't qualify you. Insults certainly don't qualify you. You—nobody can fully know what it's like to manage a global crisis or know the feeling of sending a young person into war. But I tell you, nobody has been closer to those decisions than Hillary.\nAudience member. That's right!\nThe President. As a First Lady, as a Senator, as my Secretary of State, she knows what it means. She knows what it takes. I've seen her intelligence and judgment and temperament and her discipline. I saw her in the Situation Room, where she argued for the bin Laden mission. I saw it in capitals around the world, where she was tirelessly pursuing diplomacy that led to new partnerships that opened up new democracies.\nShe understands that the decisions you make in this job mean life or death, affect soldiers and veterans and workers who need a good job or a raise or a decent retirement. She understands that it counts for families who are trying to climb into the middle class or stay in the middle class and kids who are looking for getting a decent education. And she listens to people, and she keeps her cool——\nAudience member. Yes, she does!\nThe President. ——and treats everybody with respect.\nAudience members. Yes!\nThe President. And no matter how daunting the odds or how many times she gets knocked down, she doesn't point fingers or complain that everything is rigged if it doesn't work out the way you want it to. She doesn't check her mike. [Laughter]\n[The President tapped the microphone several times.]\nShe just worries about getting up and working harder. And she doesn't quit. That's the Hillary I know. That's the Hillary I admire. That's why I believe that she is more qualified to be President of the United States of America.\nAnd she's got real plans to address the real concerns that she has heard on the campaign trail. You watch these debates, and everybody is all, like, well, you know—the commentators afterwards, they're all like, \"Well, she was really maybe explaining some stuff in great detail in contrast to the other candidate.\" That's because she actually knows what she's talking about, which is helpful when you're President of the United States, to know what you're talking about.\nCome on, people. Come on. [Laughter] This isn't an audition for, like, some show. [Laughter] This ain't a show. She's got specific ideas to invest in jobs, to help workers share in their company's profits, to put more young people and children and toddlers in preschool, to make sure that students get through college without taking on a ton of debt. She actually is sweating the details. She cares about this stuff.\nI remember 5 years ago, I asked every Cabinet Secretary to give me new ideas for ways to get our economy creating jobs faster because, at that point, Republicans were in charge of Congress; they weren't passing a lot of legislation. So we were trying to think creatively what we can do without Congress doing anything. And Hillary sent a 12-page, single-spaced memo, had footnotes. [Laughter] I was, like, Lord, let me—[laughter]. I had to do my homework.\nBut that's who she is. That's what she has spent her life doing: fighting for every child and every family. Not just popping off, but working to actually do stuff. Golly.\nAnd by the way, Deborah Ross will do the same thing when you elect her to be your next Senator. She is a worker. She's heard your stories. She's going to fight to make sure working families have a fair shot, that our kids have a world-class education, that seniors have the secure retirement they have earned. And unlike, her opponent, she's certainly not going to keep standing with Donald Trump. Now, let me just make a comment on this.\nAudience member. You go ahead!\nThe President. Let me—hey, can I say something. Okay. All right. Uh-oh, somebody is yelling at me again.\nAudience members. Boo!\n[An audience member walked toward the podium, yelling and pointing at the President. He was then escorted out by security personnel.] The President. All right. Thank you. Thank you. He was okay. He's okay. You know what. This is our democracy at work. This is great. Hey, hold up, hold up a second. I heard some people booing. What have I said before? Don't boo——\nAudience members. Vote!\nThe President. Don't boo——\nAudience members. Vote!\nThe President. Don't boo——\nAudience members. Vote!\nThe President. Okay. [Laughter] Because it doesn't really matter if some young man just runs across here and gets his 5 seconds of fame. What matters is who is voting.\nBut I'll get back to that later. I had another thing I want to talk about. Let me just say this. There is a—I do not believe that every Republican elected official thinks the way Donald Trump does. I think many of them do not. Hold on a second, let me make my point, now. [Laughter] It's good having a hype man or woman, but you've got to wait until I make my point before you hype it. [Laughter]\nSo the overwhelming majority of Republicans, they love their families, they love this country. They're good and decent people doing all kinds of good things. But what is true is——\nAudience member. Democrats, no! [Laughter]\nThe President. What is true is that over the last 8, 10, depending on however long you want to say, if you've been only about obstruction, if in order to score political points, you tell your voter base crazy stuff, like I wasn't born here—[laughter]—or that I'm a Muslim or that—well, it's just a long list. [Laughter] And you just repeat it over and over again. All right. And so that your only agenda is negative, and you just make up facts. So if 99 percent of scientists say the planet is getting warmer and this is something you should worry about, and then you bring a snowball into the Senate Chambers and say it was snowing outside, so you must be wrong, using that as evidence—[laughter]—to dispute scientists. That over time what happens is that you produce a nominee who is all about obstruction and insults and makes up his own facts.\nNow, I don't think that's how the majority of Republicans think, but this is the habits that you get into that create this kind of nominee. And now you find a situation in which the guy says stuff that nobody would find tolerable if they were applying for a job at 7-11. Or you—I mean, I don't know what job if you were kind of vetting somebody for a job, and then you heard what somebody said on tape about women——\nAudience member. Come on, President Obama! Tell it!\nThe President. ——set aside what they were saying about other stuff—that you would hire that person for that job. And the fact that now you've got people saying, well, we strongly disapprove, we really disagree, we find those comments disgusting, but we're still endorsing him, we still think he should be President—that doesn't make sense to me.\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. Now, I hear, then, some people saying, well, I'm a Christian, and so I'm all about forgiveness because nobody is perfect. Well, that is true. I am certainly not perfect. Nobody is perfect. And I, too, believe in forgiveness and redemption. But that doesn't mean I'm going to elect the person President. You know, if somebody does something terrible or shows themselves to be unqualified for office—[laughter]—I can forgive them, I suppose, if they're sincere about it. But I don't want them necessarily leading the country, right? So you can't have it both ways here. You can't repeatedly denounce what is said by someone, and then say, but I'm still going to endorse them to be the most powerful person on the planet and to put them in charge.\nAnd so I just wanted to make that point—[laughter]—because there are still a number of Republican elected officials, some of whom I know ,and I'm sure are embarrassed and say, wow, that was a really terrible thing he said, but they can't bring themselves to say I can't endorse this guy. And by the way, why did it take so long for some of them to finally do walk away?\nAudience member. That's right!\nThe President. I mean, we saw this coming. He's been saying really bad stuff for a while now. What did you think? He was just going to transform himself? [Laughter] I mean, I'm 55, and it's hard for me to change. I know at 70, it's going to be harder. [Laughter]\nAnyway, I wanted to make that point. Let me get back on script here. So this—so setting aside character issues and what he said, he calls himself the best business guy who ever lived. But we've got a lot of businessmen and women around the country who succeeded without hiding their tax returns. Warren Buffett is a pretty good businessman. He just put out his tax returns.\nI also don't know a lot of casino operators who manage to lose almost a billion dollars in a year. They say the house always wins. I don't know what happened. [Laughter] I don't know folks who use that failure, then, to avoid paying Federal income taxes for our troops and our vets and our roads and our schools. You don't brag about not paying your taxes. You don't say that makes you smart. No, that means you are not a responsible citizen, because those taxes are used to make sure that our veterans get the care they need or our roads get rebuilt or our students are able to get the support that they need to get an education.\nWhen I hear somebody say they were rooting for the housing crisis because, hey, that's called business or filed bankruptcy six times, which let him get out of paying for what he owed small businesses and their workers. When your concern isn't for the family facing the hardship of foreclosure or the small businesses and communities that depend on them, but rather how you might get over and make a buck off it, then, okay, you know what, maybe that's your kind of business, but that's not the spirit you bring to the highest office in the land. You shouldn't be President of the United States.\nAnd a guy who has spent 70 years on this Earth showing no regard for working people is not going to suddenly be the champion of working people.\nIf you want a leader who actually values hard work and values working Americans; if you want higher wages and better benefits and a fairer Tax Code and equal pay for equal work for women and stronger regulations on Wall Street, then you've got to vote for Hillary. And you've got to vote for Deborah. That's what I'm talking about.\nAnd if you're concerned about who's going to keep you or your family safe in a dangerous world, the choice is even clearer.\nAudience member. Amen! The President. Hillary has worked closely with our intelligence teams and our diplomats and our military. She'll see to it that our troops finish the job defeating ISIL. And she'll do it without resorting to torture or banning entire religions from our country. She's got the chops. She's got the temperament. She's got the knowledge to be the next Commander in Chief.\nAnd then, you've got the guy who insults POWs and attacks a Gold Star mom and calls our troops and our veterans weak. He doesn't know, apparently, the men and women in uniform who make us strong and then brags—cozies up to dictators, tells our allies we might not be on their side unless they pay up first.\nLook, he may not make good on his promises, but the United States of America has to make good on ours. And he might be up, I guess, at 3 a.m., but that's because he's tweeting insults at somebody who got under his skin instead of getting a decent night's sleep so he can be ready in the morning to do the job of being President of the United States.\nCome on! He is not fit to be Commander in Chief. And he's certainly not fit to lead the world's greatest democracy.\nLet me say this, and this has been remarked upon. And this is serious business. When in the middle of a debate you threaten to put your political opponent in jail, not—no trial, no indictment, no lawyers, no—just—[laughter]. When you welcome Russian meddling in our electoral process, then you're disregarding not just things like facts or evidence or a free press, but you're chipping away at basic values like tolerance and due process and mutual respect. And our democracy doesn't work that way.\nThere are other nations around the world who operate like that. Their political systems operate like that. And those nations break down. We have stood in contrast and in opposition to those kinds of ideas. And I, frankly, never thought I'd see the day when we had a major-party candidate who would be promoting those kinds of notions.\nLook, Greensboro, one thing I've learned these past 8 years is that progress is hard. It is a grind. You've got to battle it out. Even when we get victories like Obamacare, they're never perfect, and then you've got to keep on working to make them better. And when you take two steps forward on something like climate change, there are going to be folks who push back, and it's okay because that's what—that's the price of a democracy, is you don't get a hundred percent of what you want a hundred percent of the time.\nAudience member. That's right! That's right!\nThe President. Democracy is not easy, especially not in a big, diverse country like this. You've got to work at it. And there's only one candidate in this race who understands that democracy in a big, diverse country doesn't work if you constantly demonize each other, and I mean that literally, by the way. There—I was reading the other day, there's a guy on the radio who apparently Trump is on his show frequently. He said me and Hillary are demons, said we smell like sulfur. Ain't that something?\nAudience members. Boo!\n[The President sniffed his hand.]\nThe President. Now, I mean, come on, people. [Laughter] This—democracy does not work if you just say stuff like that, or—and apparently, there are people who believe that stuff, and they're listening to it constantly. And you can't have leaders who are promoting that, because what happens then is, we get so divided, and people are so angry at each other that nothing gets done.\nAnd Hillary understands that. She understands that on most big issues, it's not always simple black and white. Things getting done requires compromise even when you're a hundred-percent right, you think. She knows that for progress to happen, we have to listen to each other, and we have to see each other. We have to fight for our principles, but we have to also fight to find common ground.\nAudience members. Yes!\nThe President. And she believes that we can and should conduct ourselves better. And you know, that's not always flashy. It doesn't always attract headlines. And our politics doesn't always make that easy. We want progress right away, our way, and if somebody is getting in our way, then we start calling them names. And the press finds it attractive to promote conflict, and that's the flashy headline. But I promise, here's the thing, if we just—if we're willing to work at it, progress does happen.\nAudience members. Yes!\nThe President. And if you don't believe that, ask the 20 million more Americans who have health care today that didn't have it before. Ask the marine who proudly serves his country without having to hide the husband he loves. Ask the young people who got more Pell grants and help to get a college education. Change takes time, but change is possible.\nAnd here's the last thing, Greensboro. It doesn't just depend on one person, it depends on all of us. And I especially want to talk to the young people here for a minute. You've been through a lot in your young lives. You've grown up through war, and you've grown up through recession, and you've grown up through all kinds of incredible changes. I mean, it was just a little bit ago that there was no such thing as a smartphone, which I know seems insane to you. But it's true. We survived without them. [Laughter] So things have just been happening fast.\nBut what I've seen from young people is that you care about looking out for each other, not turning on each other. The young people I meet, they are more tolerant, and they are more sophisticated, and they are more interested in the world. And you want to be active and engaged in the work of creating a vibrant and innovative and inclusive and mobile society and a democracy that works. And when I meet young people, as strange as this seems, I see the values that my mom and my grandparents tried to instill in me: decent, honest, hard-working, civil, courteous, polite, \"yes, ma'am,\" \"no, ma'am,\" \"how can I help you, ma'am.\" I see those values in this next generation. Those values aren't old fashioned.\nWhen I see people who say they're conservative, well, you know what, my grandparents were kind of conservative. But to them, that meant that, like, you acted right. It meant you had good home training. It meant you didn't say crude things just to get attention. And I think most young people understand that. They understand those values that are timeless. They're not even Democrat or Republican; they're American values that bind us together as a country.\nAnd so, yeah, there are a lot of things about our politics that can sometimes seem cheap and trivial and frustrating. I know. I've seen it. But here's a chance to reject a divisive, mean-spirited politics that would just take us backwards. And you know there's nothing cheap or trivial about that, about making that statement: the chance to elect a woman who has spent her entire life trying to make this country better, that's real. That is true. And young people, you have a chance to do that. So don't fall for the easy cynicism that says my vote doesn't matter or all politicians are the same, because that's exactly what Hillary's opponent wants you to think so you don't vote.\nI promise you, your vote matters. Read up on your history. You just heard from Judge Frye. There was a time, right here in North Carolina, and just look, that judge, he looks good. I mean, he was right there before you, young people, and he couldn't vote. There was a time when folks had to guess the number of jelly beans in a jar, the number of bubbles on a bar of soap. It wasn't that long ago where folks were beaten to register voters in Mississippi. It wasn't that long ago that a man like Justice Frye, who had already graduated college, was denied the right to vote because he failed a so-called literacy test. That just happened. And the reason it changed was because young people said it's going to change. And folks risked everything so we could pull that lever. Freedom Riders came down so that people could have the right to vote.\nSo I—whatever the issue you care about, the choice could not be clearer. If you care about inequality, if you supported Bernie in the primaries, you've got a choice. You can vote for somebody whose economic policies are driven solely by greed and self-interest, or you can vote for somebody who is going to make sure our economy works for everybody, not just folks at the top, who will fight like heck to make sure minimum wage workers get a raise, and women get paid the same as men for doing the same job.\nIf you care about criminal justice reform, you can vote for somebody who has fought against civil rights and equality his entire career, or you can vote for somebody who started her career going undercover from school to school to make sure minority kids were getting an equal shot at a good education and who has not stopped fighting for justice and equality ever since.\nIf you care about the environment and climate change, you can vote for somebody who says it's a Chinese plot—[laughter]—and puts a climate denier in charge of hiring folks at the EPA, or you can vote for somebody who believes in science and will keep America a world leader in fighting to protect our planet.\nIf you care about immigration reform, you can vote for somebody who apparently only see immigrants as criminals and rapists to be rounded up or kicked out, or—even though, by the way, they've already paid more taxes probably than he has—or you can vote for a granddaughter of an immigrant who believes everybody deserves a chance to contribute to this country we love.\nIf you care about transparency, you can vote for a candidate who's released decades' worth of her tax returns or the only candidate in decades who refused to release any at all.\nOne candidate has a foundation that saved countless lives around the world. The other took money that people gave to his charity to buy a 6-foot-tall painting of himself. [Laughter] I'm not kidding.\nOne candidate traveled more countries than any Secretary of State before. The other is Donald Trump. [Laughter]\nSo when he asks you, what do you have to lose? The answer is, you've got everything to lose. All the progress we've made these last 8 years is on the ballot. Civility is on the ballot. Respect for women is on the ballot. Tolerance is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot. Equality is on the ballot. Democracy is on the ballot. If you want to send a message in this election, make it a resounding message. Turn back the forces of racism and misogyny, and send a message for progress. Send a message for facts. Send a message for reason. Send a message for hope. Send a message by voting for Hillary Clinton. Send a message for Deborah Ross. Send a message about who we are as the American people and make our kids proud.\nThank you, Greensboro. I love you. Let's get to work.", "timestamp": "2016-10-11", "title": "Remarks at a Campaign Rally for Democratic Presidential Nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton in Greensboro, North Carolina"}

{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "note": "Speech as delivered.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119157", "text": "\"Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Wow.\nAudience: Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!\nThank you so very, very much. Wow. I am so happy to be back here and to be here with all of you. I am thrilled. And I can't thank you enough.\nAnd it's a special privilege and pleasure to be introduced by my friend and such a great leader, someone who has served not only this state so well, but also our country. And so I want to thank -- once again, I want to thank former senator and former secretary, Ken Salazar.\nAnd I also want to thank somebody else who's here who is really special and is doing such a great job for all of you. And that is your senator, and I hope you will get out and send him back to Washington, Michael Bennet.\nI also want to recognize someone who's running a great race for congress, Gail Schwartz.\nI -- I was thinking -- I was thinking, the first time I came to this beautiful place and had a chance to meet people from here was in 1992.\nI was here for somebody else, namely my husband who was running for president.\nAnd I know there are a lot of really young people here, but was anybody here back in 1992?\nWell, Bill and I talk about Pueblo all the time. And it is always a treat for either one of us to come. And today, it's especially important because we are getting closer and closer and closer to the next election. And we're also very conscious of the fact that here in Colorado for the first time, you are all going to be able to vote by mail.\nAnd this Monday, October 17th, ballots will start being mailed to Colorado voters.\nNow, if you've already registered to vote, I hope you'll keep your eye open for the mail and fill out your ballot. Send it back as quick as you can. Don't wait to fill it out.\nDon't do what I do, put it on the kitchen counter and then you put something else on top of it and something else and pretty soon you're wondering, \"Where is that ballot? I know it cam here a few days ago.\" So please put it in the mail so we can get every early vote counted quickly and avoid a big backlog on election night.\nAnd maybe -- if you haven't registered to vote yet, please do it right now. And if you go to Iwillvote.com, you can do that on your phones -- you do that right now -- you can get registered. Pretty easy, huh?\nBecause we need everybody to vote in this election. And we need your friends and your family and everyone you can reach, because this is about something so important. I don't know that there's ever been a more serious or consequential election. And we can see that people feel that way, because across America, people are already voting in high numbers.\nA lot of states have what's called early vote, and the numbers are bigger than anybody thought. And bigger than they've been in the past.\nJust this morning in Ohio, people began lining up last night so they could be sure to vote. They couldn't wait to cast their ballots. And by the time we're done, we expect record numbers of people to vote in this presidential election.\nSo don't be left out because we need you. And oh by the way, if you've got friends in Utah or Arizona make sure they vote too. We are competing everywhere and the polls are tightening because I think Americans want to turn out as big a number as possible to reject the dark and divisive and hateful campaign that is being run by my opponent.\nAnd you know, your vote can make all the difference. I was in Florida yesterday with former Vice President Gore.\nAnd as he said yesterday, take it from him, every vote counts. So don't sit this one out. And I'm very proud of the campaign we've run. I'm proud of the campaign Bernie Sanders and I ran.\nIt was about -- it was about issues, not insults. We were setting forth a positive agenda that would help America. And help millions and millions of Americans get ahead and stay ahead.\nAnd to me, that is what we're supposed to be doing. We're supposed to bring people together. We're supposed to unify our country. We're supposed to solve our problems by working together.\nAnd I know it's been a long race, but as soon as our primary finished, Senator Sanders and I got together and came up with a plan to make college affordable and pay back student debt, provide more healthcare. And we have done our best to stay out of all the meanness.\nYou know, the other night -- did you see that last debate?\nWell, I was watching my opponent just go lower and lower and lower. And I was reminded of what my friend, and our first lady, Michelle Obama says.\nWhen they go low, we go high.\nAnd I want you to know I want to be -- I want to be the president for everyone. I am tired of the all the divisions and the barriers. I want to bring people together across our party lines, across any lines that divide us. And not just people who vote for me, I want to be the president, yes, for Democrats, but also Republicans and Independents.\nAnd I am very grateful for all of the Republicans who are supporting me. And I am very -- I'm very appreciative of all of the newspapers that are endorsing me, some of whom have never endorsed a Democrat before.\nSo we're going to keep running this campaign. I want to give you something to vote for, not just something to vote against.\nAnd during these next 28 days, we're going to crisscross our country. We're going to be talking about what we can do together. But Donald Trump is taking a very different tone.\nHis campaign -- his campaign said today that they're going to use a, quote, \"scorched Earth\" strategy for the remaining four weeks of this race. Now, that just shows how desperate they are. That's all they have left, pure negativity, pessimism.\nAnd we're not going to let Donald Trump get away with it, are we?\nI don't care what he says about me. I -- I -- I care about what he says about you. And I'll tell you what, I will stand up and defend every single person in this country from the insults and the disrespect that we hear from him.\nNow, the whole world has heard how Donald Trump treats women and what he thinks of women.\nAnd he is doubling-down on his excuse that it's just, quote, \"locker room talk.\"\nWell, you know what happened? It just kind of happened spontaneously. A lot of athletes and coaches started posting on Twitter and Instagram and Facebook. I mean, the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, the NFL, and more. They are coming together and they're saying, \"That doesn't happen in our locker rooms.\"\nBut of course, you know, it's not only women that he has disrespected. He's insulted practically everybody. He went after a distinguished federal judge, Judge Curiel, who was born in Indiana. And Trump said, \"Well, he couldn't be trusted because his parents were Mexican.\"\nHe has targeted immigrants, African Americans, Latinos. He's targeted POWs, people with disabilities, moslems, and so many others.\nAnd every time he does that I get somebody who is worried or scared, writing me a letter or talking to me. And especially children. It's really who Donald Trump is. But when you scare children, you know, like a little boy. His mother wrote to me. She had adopted him from Ethiopia when he was a toddler. There were a lot of children in Ethiopia that were no longer able to live with families. Their parents, their grandparents were not around. And a lot of Americans have adopted children in need like that and this little boy named Felix is now ten years old. He's only lived in the United States. And his mother wrote me and she said that after hearing Donald Trump, he turned to her and asked, 'Mommy, will he send me back to Ethiopia?'\nThat's the kind of fear and anxiety that I hear from immigrant families who are scared to death, especially the children, that Donald Trump is going to put together a big deportation force and go door to door, school to school, business to business, home to home.\nAnd it is hard to explain to children. And so I hope that if you know any children who are listening and watching and hearing some of what is said, you will reassure them. I want every boy and girl to know the American dream is big enough for you and there is a place in America for you.\nAnd that in this election, we will demonstrate that America is better than what Donald Trump says and represents.\nBut here's what I also want to know. We have a big difference about how best to get the economy going. You know, Trump wants to give trillions and trillions in tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires.\nYou know, that's called trickle down economics, but as with anything when it comes to Donald Trump, he wants to have the biggest tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations than we have ever, ever had. So I believe differently. We're going to invest in the middle class. We're going to invest in you, in your jobs, in your future.\nAudience: Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!\nWell, you know, you do have to feel a little sorry for them. They've had a really bad couple of weeks.\nBut you know, part of the difference in how we see the economy I think comes from our experiences. You know, Donald grew up the son of a millionaire. He got started in business by borrowing $14 million from his dad. So it's not a surprise he wants to keep giving back to the wealthy, because that's his own experience. I grew up differently. My father was a factory worker. Well, my grandfather was a factory worker. My father was a small businessman. I know how hard they worked and I am grateful for the middle class life that they gave us, and that's what I want to make sure everybody gets.\nThat's why I believe we've got to get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top, and we're going to focus on those issues. We're going to make it possible to have more good jobs in infrastructure. We need to fix our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports and our airports.\nAnd we need to make sure that the rich pay their fair share because here's what we've learned, Donald Trump hasn't paid a penny in federal income tax in years.\nNow this is all allegedly because of course we don't know for sure because he won't release his income taxes but it's allegedly because he lost $1 billion running casinos. Now I ask you, who loses $1 billion running casinos, right?\nDo you know how hard that is? But think about it, it means he's contributed zero. Zero for our military, zero for our vets, zero for education and health and he has the gall to go around disrespecting our military.\nHe calls the United States military a disaster.\nWell the only disaster is somebody who can get away with paying no taxes and have the gall to run for president and criticize all the rest of us who have done our part to support America.\nNow, you've all heard his slogan, Make America Great Again, right? Well that would have maybe some truth to it if he made anything in America and if he bought things that are made in America. There are so many examples but let me just give you one, which is close to your hearts, because Pueblo is one of the largest steel producing cities in America, right?\nSo you know how important it is to support our steel workers and our steel industry.\nNow, Trump is the guy who went around for a year talking about how he was on the side of workers and all the rest of it. No truth to it, but you know, he did say it over and over again and we've slowly but surely uncovered how little he's done to help anybody except Donald Trump.\nAnd he has bought Chinese steel for his buildings. Not American steel. He could be buying American steel, he should be buying American steel. If he wants to make America great again, start by America with American steel.\nI have a very different idea and in addition to jobs and infrastructure, which uses American steel, we're going to do more on advanced manufacturing, on technology and innovation, on clean energy jobs and we're going to make the economy fairer at the same time. And here's what I want the young people and their families to hear.\nSenator Sanders and I got together on a plan. We are going to make public college tuition free for working families and debt free for everyone else.\nIf you already have debt because you're trying to get your education, we're going to help you refinance it. It is wrong that you could refinance a home and refinance car but you can't refinance your student debt. And we're going to make it possible for you to pay it back as a percentage of your income.\nNow, based on this plan, we will save millions of people thousands of dollars, and you can go to hillaryclinton.com/calculator to see how much you and your family can save. Because we want to liberate young people and families from the burden of college debt.\nAnd we're also gonna make the economy fairer by raising the national minimum wage so people who work full-time won't be in poverty.\nAnd we're going to expand Social Security for those who need it the most - low income seniors and widowed women.\nAnd we are going to pass comprehensive immigration reform.\nI'm going to introduce reform. I can't wait to work with Senator Bennet, I can't wait to have a chance to make sure that we are working on immigration reform from the very beginning. We're gonna finally help dreamers achieve their dream of following their future and becoming American citizens.\nI also think it is past time, don't you, to guarantee equal pay for women's work?\nYou know I started talking about equal pay years and years and years ago because it's not only a woman's issue it's a family issue. If you have a wife or a daughter or a mother or a sister it's your issue. Right? You know that.\nSo Donald Trump always says, you know I'm playing the woman card. And my response is pretty simple. If being for equal pay and affordable childcare and paid family leave is playing the woman's card, then deal me in.\nYou see I am very excited, I am very excited about what we could do. You know I give President Obama a lot of credit. He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. I remember, because he called and asked me to come see him shortly after the election.\nAnd I didn't know why. He wanted me to be secretary of state but I didn't know that. But I got there and the first thing he says is, \"It's so much worse than they told us.\"\nAnd it was. You remember. It was terrible. Millions of people lost their jobs and homes were lost and it was just a horrible time. We have dug ourselves out of that ditch, thanks to everybody's hard work.\nAnd we can't ever go back there because believe me, trickle-down economics and refusing to regulate Wall Street and the mortgage market is what got us into that mess in the first place.\nAnd Donald Trump wants to get rid of the new rules on Wall Street. He wants to get rid of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which returns money to people who've been defrauded by big companies. Well I have a totally different view.\nWe're gonna keep those and then we're going to tell companies that try to move jobs out of our country that if they try to they're gonna have to pay an exit tax and return every penny, every penny, of tax benefit they've ever gotten.\nAnd I've been very clear about how we're gonna pay for what I want to do. It is going to be going after the wealthy, closing the loopholes on corporations.\nI can pledge to you, I will never raise middle class federal taxes. It is not right.\nAnd what I've been trying to do listening to people around the country is figure out what we can do to help you with what I call kitchen table issues. And we thank you very much.\nWhat - right now - thank you.\nYou know, I always feel so welcome when I come to Pueblo. I think I'll come here anytime it gets hard in the White House. What do you say?\nFinally I want to tell you that I want to make it easier for you to raise your kids. You know, there is nothing more important.\nI'm now a grandmother of two wonderful grandchildren, a little girl, a little boy. And there are too many hard-working families struggling with the cost of raising children.\nSo right now most families with kids get something called the child tax credit. It gives a middle-class family $1000 per child to help you defray the costs. I'm going to double - I'm going to double the child tax credit.\nThat's another $1,000 for young kids to pay for the things you need, whether it's child care, housing, prescription drugs, groceries, or anything else, it is just one example of the tax relief I want to give to working families and we're going to make sure that it gets to the people who need it most.\nWe're going to lift families out of poverty. In fact, the changes I am proposing we think will automatically help more people get out of poverty and we're going to look for other ways to help you.\nWhat I am interested in is your success, your futures, your possibilities, your dreams. I want to be a president who makes it possible for more people to feel like they are really moving and their kids are going to have better lives.\nThat is how I was raised. That's what I want for you and every single family, every single child in America!\nSo we have about four weeks ago. It's going to be - it's going to be a race to the finish line, my friends. And here is what I want to ask you.\nAs I said in the beginning, think about everything that is important to you, whether it is jobs and rising incomes, whether it is education, healthcare, whatever it might be. Whether it is protecting our rights.\nPeople who have fought so hard, whether it is immigration reform, whatever it might be, think about it because you know what?\nThose issues will be on the ballot. They may not be listed there, but you could not have two more different people running for president than me and Donald Trump.\nAnd I know that if people turn out, I know if people show up, we're going to win and we're going to be able to do everything I've talked about.\nAnd so it call comes to down whether or not you take that ballot you get in the mail, you fill it in, you send it back, you do everything you can to make sure that your vote will be counted.\nYou know, when I think about this election, I do think about my grandchildren a lot. Yeah, you, too, right?\nI'll tell you what, for those of you who aren't grandparents yet, it is an incredible experience. Right?\nAnd there is nothing I wouldn't do for them. As I like to say, face time was invented for grandparents, and you get to check in and see how they're doing. But more than that, what kind of lives are they going to have and what kind of country is going to be waiting for them?\nI know how important it is that families and communities and our country stand behind every child. Make sure every child has a good education, a good school, good teachers, and every zip code in America. Make sure every child -- every child has the healthcare that he or she needs. That's why I work to create the Children's Health Insurance Program, so we can take care of millions of children.\nThat's why every family deserves to have a good job with a good income to be able to be good providers for their kids.\nI got into this work so many years ago. I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund, right out of law school. And I spent my time trying to figure out how you even the odds for all kids. And the reason I did that is because of my own mother.\nI didn't know it when I was just a little girl, but I learned as I got older that my mother was abandoned and neglected by her parents and pretty much left on her own, and then at the age of eight, holding her little three-year-old sister's hand, she was put on a train by themselves to go to California to live with grandparents.\nIt turned out the grandparents didn't really want her either. So by the age of 14, she was working in a house as a maid and a babysitter. But here's what I want you to know. It sounds pretty harsh. It was difficult. It made a profound impression on her life. I think my mom, who lived to the wonderful age of 92, I don't think there was a day that went by that she didn't think about being abandoned and being sent away and being pretty much left on her own.\nBut, along the way, people were kind to her. People helped her. The first grade teacher who brought lunch for her every day, because my mother never had any -- the woman whose house she went to work in all those years ago knew my mother wanted to go to high school, so she said to her, Dorothy, if you get up early and you get your chores done, you can go to high school.\nNow, you'll have to come right back home. That might sound kind of unfortunate, but for my mom, it was a gift, because she really wanted to go to high school.\nAnd so my mother always cared about other people. And she taught me in every way she could that nobody is better than anybody else, right.\nAnd we need to show each other more kindness and support. And the last thing we need in our country are more bullies making people feel bad about themselves and pushing people away, we should be drawing people toward us.\nWe should be creating the kind of future we want for every one of our children. That's what I think about when I imagine, if I'm so fortunate enough to become president, I think about waking up -- waking up —\nI think about waking up in the White House every morning trying to figure out what can I do to help somebody else and who can I work with? How many families and communities across America will work with us to come up with ideas that give every single child the chance to live up to his or her God given potential?\nThat's what I think we are called to do. Whether you're a person of faith or not, the American dream is really premised on people coming together to lift each other up. Nobody, nobody makes it alone. Everybody has somebody who helps them along the way.\nSo let's pull together, Pueblo, let's get out and vote for the kind of positive future we want for ourselves and our children. God bless you, thank you.\"", "timestamp": "2016-10-12", "title": "Remarks at the Palace of Agriculture at the Colorado State Fairgrounds in Pueblo"}

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119554", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:08 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. I apologize for the late start today. I do not have any announcements at the top, so we can go straight to your questions.\nKevin, do you want to start?\nQ: Sure, Josh, thank you. Russia says its Foreign Minister will meet with Secretary Kerry to discuss efforts to find a peace deal in Syria. I'd like to ask, what's changed? You'd broken off bilateral diplomatic contact over the Syrian war earlier this month. What's going on?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, my understanding is that this is not a bilateral meeting. This is actually a meeting of several members of the International Syria Support Group. Secretary Kerry will be participating. This is a follow-up to the meeting that they had a week or two ago among a similar group of members at a lower level. And we have gone to great lengths to describe the continuing -- or the continued bilateral, diplomatic -- let me just start that sentence over. We have gone to great lengths to make clear the continued multilateral, diplomatic efforts that we're engaged in to try to reduce the violence inside of Syria. And we have pursued those diplomatic efforts through the United Nations. We have pursued those through the International Syria Support Group, and some of those members will be meeting next week.\nWhat I also understand is that after that meeting, Secretary Kerry will then travel to another location in Europe -- the city is escaping me -- where he will meet with some of our European allies to discuss the situation in Syria. So, again, this is just further illustration of the deep, multilateral engagement that we are pursuing through diplomacy to try to reduce the violence inside of Syria.\nAnd look, the reason that we broke off bilateral talks with the Russians was directly related to Russia's inability to keep their commitments. And the agreement that we had been trying to implement was one that would give Russia the opportunity to make good on their promise to use their influence with the Assad regime to reduce the violence against civilians in opposition-controlled territory, including in Aleppo. And in exchange for a reduction of that violence and the steady flow of humanitarian assistance, the United States would begin military cooperation with the Russians in applying pressure to extremists there.\nBut Russia was never able to, on a sustained basis, fulfill their end of the bargain, and so we never got to the point where the United States was cooperating militarily with the Russians. So that is no longer an agreement that we're trying to broker, but we are certainly working through a variety of diplomatic channels to try to reduce the violence inside of Syria, and that's necessarily going to include some Russian participation. But it no longer is in the context of trying to broker this agreement that would, at the end of it, hold out the prospect of U.S. military cooperation with Russia. That's something that Russia has lost -- frankly, lost the credibility to be able to try to agree to.\nSo let me just close by saying none of this has any impact on our continued, sustained, unrelenting campaign against ISIL leaders and extremists in Iraq and in Syria that we're pursuing through our counter-ISIL coalition, and that includes 67 members that's being led by the United States. That effort continues unabated. That effort has taken a toll on ISIL's leadership. That effort has taken a toll on the leadership of other extremist organizations that are operating there. And that is a testament to our men and women in uniform who are working closely with our allies and partners in the context of the counter-ISIL coalition to apply pressure to those extremist organizations and to take back territory that ISIL previously controlled in Iraq and in Syria.\nQ: So if Russian and U.S. officials are in the same room, and these are part of -- you said with other nations -- multilateral talks, how does that advance the peace prospects beyond bilateral talks?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there are other countries in the region that do have influence with groups that are a part of this conflict. So what we're looking for is a way that the international community can come together around a strategy for reducing the violence there. And we hoped we would be able to do something directly with the Russians to affect that outcome, but because Russia failed to live up to their terms of that agreement, that effort did not yield the kind of progress that we would like to see.\nSo we're pursuing other channels, and we're going to continue to work through the U.N., through the Security Council, through the U.N. Special Envoy, through the International Syria Support Group, through our counter-ISIL coalition, through our other engagements in Europe and our partners in the region to try to reduce the violence and bring the humanitarian assistance to the communities that need it the most.\nQ: In the wake of the funeral home strike in Yemen last week, is the Obama administration reviewing planned arms sales to Saudi Arabia with potentially a scaling back or cancellation of such sales?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, as you saw in the statement that was issued over the weekend, the United States is in the process of reviewing the assistance that we provide to the Saudis. Now, just to reiterate, the assistance that we provide is primarily logistical support. We do share some intelligence with them, but the United States does not do targeting for them. The Saudis and their partners use some of the intelligence that we have collected, but they make their own targeting decisions.\nWe were deeply concerned about this incident that claimed so many innocent lives. And we have routinely encouraged people on all sides of that conflict to be mindful of the potential consequences for civilians who are in harm's way. And the United States, when we're undertaking military operations, go to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties. And we want our allies and partners to do the same thing. So our security cooperation with Saudi Arabia is not a blank check, and we do have expectations about the conduct of our partners.\nThat all said, our partners in Saudi Arabia have a legitimate security concern with the violence inside of Yemen. Saudi Arabia has a rather long border with Yemen, and there have been incidents of cross-border violence, including the firing of mortars across that border into Saudi Arabia that does threaten Saudi citizens. So it's understandable that Saudi Arabia would want to confront this threat, but particularly when it comes to the defense of their territorial integrity. But there are expectations that we have as well.\nQ: Josh, does this strike jeopardize arms sales to Saudi Arabia? Is that something the administration is reviewing?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, as the statement indicated over the weekend, the administration is conducting a review of the security assistance that we do provide to the Saudis. I'm not going to stand here and make threats about potential outcomes, but there is a review and I think that is a pretty clear illustration that the security assistance that we do provide is not a blank check.\nJeff.\nQ: Josh, on Tuesday, climate activists broke through fences and cut locks and chains simultaneously in the states -- several states, and turned some major pipelines off. What concerns did this raise at the White House about security of U.S. pipelines? And what steps are being taken, if any, to improve that?\nMR. EARNEST: Jeff, I only recently became aware of these reports. I can tell you that both the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Transportation are investigating these reports and trying to get to the bottom of what exactly happened and what potential steps could be taken to ensure the safety and security of our energy infrastructure.\nSo for potential steps that can or should be taken, I'd refer you to them. Obviously, the President in a variety of contexts has talked about the importance of securing our infrastructure. And we certainly take that security quite seriously.\nQ: And I understand if you haven't seen much more of the reports. But doesn't it sort of raise the possibility that this could have been a lot worse had it been people with perhaps more nefarious intent?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess I'd refer to the experts at DHS who could give you a better security assessment about what sort of damage could have been caused by the reported breaches. But when it comes to the security of our infrastructure, particularly our energy infrastructure, that's something that the United States and this administration takes quite seriously.\nQ: On another topic, Turkey said today that it would keep troops in Iraq until Islamic State forces were cleared from Mosul. This is against the wishes of the Iraqi government. Obviously, this debate has been going on for some time.\nMR. EARNEST: It has.\nQ: How is the U.S. helping to resolve this issue? And how do you react to the latest statements from Turkey?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, you've heard me stand here on many occasions, unfortunately in the aftermath of terrorist incidents, expressing our solidarity with our NATO Ally Turkey about the need to defend their people and their territory. And the United States has demonstrated our commitment to their security in a variety of ways, primarily through our NATO Alliance. And so we understand the need, the imperative that the Turkish government has to protect their citizens from terrorism.\nAt the same time, since the very beginning of our counter-ISIL efforts, the United States has made clear that the presence of the United States military and other members of our Counter-ISIL Coalition is at the invitation of the Iraq central government. And all of our counter-ISIL efforts, including our military operations, are in support of operations that are being undertaken by Iraqi security forces who are operating under the command and control of the Iraqi central government.\nThe Iraqi central government has to protect their territorial integrity, as well. We deeply respect their sovereignty. And, in fact, that is one of the core elements of our strategy. We've talked at some length in here about how important it is for Iraqi security forces to be in the lead in terms of clearing ISIL out of Iraq and stabilizing the communities that they have fled.\nThere is no country or group of countries that can substitute for Iraq's performance there, because it will necessarily become -- or those gains will necessarily not be nearly as stable as gains that are made by Iraqi security forces under the command and control of an Iraqi central government that's committed to pursuing an inclusive governing agenda.\nWe've talked about how this political element of our military strategy is so important to a long-term solution to the situation here. So that principle is critically important. And again, it undergirds so much of our efforts against ISIL in this region of the world.\nSo the United States has certainly been in touch with both the Iraqi central government and our Turkish Ally about this issue. And we've made clear to them the benefits that both countries stand to enjoy from focusing on our counter-ISIL efforts and pursuing a strategy that is consistent with seeing those efforts succeed.\nMichelle.\nQ: In an interview today, the Russian foreign minister called the allegations of hacking the U.S. political websites and systems as ridiculous. But he also used the word \"flattering.\" He said it was flattering that the U.S. thinks that Russia did that. What do you think of that?\nMR. EARNEST: Michelle, I guess I don't have much to say beyond the assessment that was released by the United States intelligence community at the end of last week, that reported with high confidence that the recent disclosures of alleged hacked emails on sites like DCLeaks.com, and WikiLeaks, and by Guccifer 2.0 are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. And given the scope of those efforts, the intelligence community has concluded that they're almost certainly directed by senior Russian government officials. And the intent, per the analysis of the intelligence community, is that Russia was interested in destabilizing, or at least attempting to destabilize, the U.S. political system.\nWe've seen Russia try to pursue those tactics in other countries. But, frankly, those other countries don't have the kind of well-developed, durable democratic institutions that we have in this country.\nSo the American people can continue to be confident in the stability and durability of our election systems and of our democracy. The American people, again, can also be confident that the U.S. government will deploy significant resources to defend our electoral systems. And DHS has already been working effectively with more than 30 states to fortify their systems. There are a number of other local jurisdictions that they've engaged with as well, and we certainly want to encourage election officials that have not availed themselves of this expertise to do so to ensure that people can continue to have confidence in our election system. But certainly, we believe everybody can.\nQ: The Russians -- I mean, not just the behavior, but also some of the things that they've said surrounding this, warning the U.S., certain rhetoric that they have used -- it's prompted a lot of analysis calling this like another Cold War, or going beyond a Cold War. I know that this has come up countless times in the briefing, but how would you, today, describe the relationship with Russia?\nMR. EARNEST: Extraordinarily complicated, I think, is one way to do it. There are areas where the United States and Russia have been able to coordinate effectively. They include the effective removal and destruction of Bashar al-Assad's declared chemical weapons stockpile. That was something that the United States and Russia were able to work together to achieve just a year and a half or so ago. And that would not have happened had the United States and Russia not been able to effectively coordinate.\nRussia was a part of the efforts to confront Iran over their nuclear weapons program, and the success that we have had in implementing a diplomatic solution that prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon required constructive Russian engagement. So that, obviously, was one benefit of Russia and the United States preserving an ability to work together in pursuit of common interests.\nAnother less political example would be our space program. The U.S. astronauts and Russian cosmonauts obviously work very closely together on the International Space Station to pursue scientific breakthroughs and to advance the cause of human space flight. That's something that benefits both our countries. It's something that benefits the entire planet and would not be possible without effective U.S.-Russian cooperation.\nSo there are areas where we agree, work cooperatively, in a way that benefits both our countries. We tend to spend more time talking in here about those areas where we disagree, and that's entirely appropriate too. Those disagreements are vigorous. We're deeply concerned about the way that Russia backs the Assad regime and the way that Russia has refused to use their influence with the Assad regime to reduce violence against civilians inside of Syria. And there are also examples of the Russians themselves carrying out strikes against civilian targets in Syria. That's deeply, deeply concerning, it's immoral, and it runs directly against the kinds of values that we hold dear in this country.\nSo the kind of protests that we have lodged, both in public and in private, against those tactics have been vigorous. The United States has expressed deep concern about Russia's willingness to violate the territorial integrity of Ukraine. And the United States has been able to work effectively with our European partners to impose biting sanctions against the Russians as a result of those actions.\nWe also have expressed, on a number of occasions, our concerns with Russia's behavior in cyberspace. The intelligence assessment from the intelligence community that was released at the end of last week is just the latest example of that -- certainly not the first.\nSo those disagreements are vigorous. And we spend a lot of time talking about them, but it's important not to lose sight of those areas where we are able to work effectively together to advance our interests. And that's why it's going to be important that the next President have a good understanding of the situation that they are inheriting, both to ensure that the United States of America can be protected, that our values can be advanced, and that our common interests can be pursued.\nQ: But the Russian government actually trying to influence the U.S. election -- how can cooperation really continue after this point, even in some of those areas where it's been longstanding?\nMR. EARNEST: I guess, Michelle, given the nature of the kind of cooperation we have with the Russians now, our ability to work together where our interests align is beneficial to our country. Our ability to continue to implement the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon requires continued, constructive engagement with the Russians. And we've been able to pursue that. And IAEA inspections continue, and continue to assess the degree to which Iran is following through on their commitments.\nThe same thing goes for our space program. The United States and Russia rely on one another's capabilities to continue to advance that program. That's something the President just wrote about on your organization's website earlier this week, talking about how important it is for us to continue making investments in our space program. And our country benefits from those kinds of investments.\nSo that is not to minimize the concern we have about Russia's behavior in cyberspace. And again, I think the rhetoric that you have seen from the President and from other senior administration officials, as well as the analysis from the intelligence community, supports the seriousness with which we take these Russian steps that are a source of some concern.\nQ: It's been a year ago, virtually to the day, that Secretary Kerry was talking about multilateral talks about to start over Syria with the same countries that we're talking about now. And since then, tens of thousands of people have died in Syria. So why do you think that this round of multilateral talks with the same organizations, the same people will be any different than it's been?\nMR. EARNEST: Primarily, Michelle, because we don't believe that anybody benefits from that widespread innocent loss of life. The international community has an interest in trying to resolve that violence. That violence only fuels extremism and chaos that we have seen reverberate not just across the region but around the world in the form of terrorism and in the form of the most severe migration crisis that our planet has faced since World War II.\nSo there should be an opportunity for the international community to come together. The situation in Syria is extraordinarily complex. And when you have an actor as bad as Bashar al-Assad, it makes it difficult to find diplomatic solutions that can be imposed.\nThe other reason that we're pursuing these talks, Michelle, is that we have long acknowledged that there's no military solution to this challenge. There are plenty of things that we can do militarily that will take out extremists and enhance the national security of the United States, and the United States has been leading the way in those military efforts. But when it comes to addressing the root cause of violence inside of Syria, it's going to require a diplomatic solution that's been very difficult to find.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, can I come back to the allegations of Russian email hacking? This latest bunch that has been produced, the Podesta email hacks -- any administration assessment, and intelligence assessment? Is that part of the same Russian effort? And what do you guys make of the assertion by Podesta himself that there's been some coordination or at least a heads-up given to the Trump campaign by the Russians -- or by those who published the emails?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, the thing that I can tell you about the intelligence community analysis is that at least some of the disclosures in recent months, including documents that were released by Guccifer 2.0, DC Leaks and WikiLeaks, are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. And those efforts suggest that Russia is at least providing the information or is -- let me clarify that -- that the Russian government is directing the effort or at least providing the information responsible for the leaks. And that's a source of some concern because the intelligence community has concluded with high confidence that they're doing so to try to destabilize our democracy. And that's something that obviously the President takes quite seriously.\nSo with regard to the private emails of Mr. Podesta, I can't give you a firm intelligence community analysis because the leak of those emails was first reported shortly after this analysis was made public. But, in general, the kinds of disclosures that we've seen, including at WikiLeaks, of stolen emails from people who play an important role in our political process is consistent with Russian-directed efforts.\nWith regard to any sort of communications between WikiLeaks or these hackers and the Trump campaign, I can't speak to that. But I certainly can direct you to the intelligence community analysis about what's been happening with these stolen emails over the last several months.\nJustin.\nQ: I wanted to follow up on the interview that Michelle referenced. In it, Foreign Minister Lavrov didn't explicitly deny the hacking charges, but he did say the U.S. hadn't presented \"a single fact\" to prove that Russia was responsible. I know you're obviously limited to some extent about what you can say about the IC assessment, but do you guys have any evidence or any intention to provide evidence to kind of back up this accusation? And what would you say to, I guess, allies of Donald Trump who say the U.S. government is coming out with this at a politically motivated time themselves?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me start by saying that the analysis that we're discussing here is one that was released by our professionals in the intelligence community whose foremost focus is on the safety and security of the American people, not on the outcome of the election.\nThese professionals have concluded with high confidence, based on a thorough investigation, that they could make some of this information pubic to inform the American people and to allow election administrators at the state and local level all across the country to take the necessary steps to secure their system.\nSo the intelligence community and the rest of the government feels a responsibility to communicate as much information as possible. However, this is also an ongoing investigation at the Department of Justice and by the intelligence community. And that's why there are -- much of the evidence is not something that we can discuss publicly, in part because the investigation is ongoing and we wouldn't want to compromise the investigation; in part because we don't want to compromise sources and methods that may have revealed this information.\nThe United States intelligence community has extraordinary capabilities in cyberspace that allow them to reach these kinds of conclusions. And I also think it's fair to say, Justin, and I think a reasonable person would conclude, that there's no piece of evidence the United States government could produce that would prompt Sergey Lavrov to admit Russian complicity in these efforts.\nSo there are obvious limits on what we can discuss publicly. Even if those limits did exist, I'm not confident they would satisfy senior Russian officials who frequently talk about this.\nQ: Follow?\nMR. EARNEST: I'll come back to you, Bill.\nGo ahead, Justin.\nQ: Back in July, the President issued a cyber directive about how the U.S. government would react to \"significant cyber incidents.\" I'm wondering if this is qualified under that directive, and if so, if the government set up the coordination group and some of the other sort of consequences of that determination.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, that's a good question. Let me check with our national security team and see if we make public incidents that trigger this particular mechanism. It may be a position where we don't discuss what sort of incidents have crossed that threshold. But I'll see if I can collect some more information and share with you what we can.\nQ: And lastly, I just wanted to ask about undoubtedly the most exciting news of the month, which is that the U.S. and Canada failed to renew the softwood lumber trade deal.\nMR. EARNEST: You nailed it.\nQ: Yes, the President kind of laughed this off when --\nMR. EARNEST: Come on, guys, that's -- not even like a token joke, laughter at the joke? (Laughter.) Nailed the lumber? Come on, man.\nQ: Oh, I get it now.\nMR. EARNEST: There we go. (Laughter.) There we go. That was a little late. You guys need to -- an extra cup of coffee or something this morning.\nQ: The President was kind of joking about it when he was asked in his press conference in the Rose Garden with Justin Trudeau, and said that we'd get this settled. But it obviously hasn't -- a year after the deal first collapsed. And so there's two elements of this. One, I think there's suspicion among Canadians that the U.S. is slow-walking this for electoral reasons. And so I'm wondering if you can address that. The other is, how long these negotiations would drag out before the U.S. is ready to take some sort of action either with the WTO or in the courts to sort of go after Canadian subsidies on lumber.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as you know, because you've covered this case or this situation so closely, President Obama and Prime Minister Trudeau have had an opportunity to discuss this issue face to face on at least a couple of occasions over the course of the last year. When Prime Minister Trudeau visited the White House early this year, this was part of their bilateral discussion in the Oval Office. And when President Obama traveled to Canada this summer, there was an opportunity for the two leaders to sit down in the context of a bilateral meeting. And this was one item that featured prominently on the agenda.\nIn the context of both of those conversations, President Obama made clear the U.S. commitment to resolving our differences. And the fact that negotiations are continuing this week I think is an indication that the United States takes quite seriously the concerns that have been raised by the Canadians. And there is a genuine desire on the part of the administration to try to resolve those concerns in a way that protects U.S. interests, first and foremost, but also satisfies our close allies up north. So there is an ongoing effort to work through this, and my colleagues at the USTR are prepared to meet with their Canadian counterparts again, I think even later this week, to continue the work to try to resolve this situation.\nApril.\nQ: Josh, I've got a couple questions, and I want to start off with the email situation. Looking at this press release and the statement from the Department of Homeland Security, it says, \"The U.S. intelligence community is confident that the Russian government directed the recent compromise of emails from U.S. persons and institutions.\" And it goes on other things.\nWith that, you talked about the fact that there was a complicated relationship. Does that work in the dynamic of action to be taken against Russia as DHS is saying they're confident that the Russian government did this? What's the reason why we haven't heard about actions being taken against Russia?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I was asked about this a little bit yesterday. And, April, what I made clear is that in the realm of cyberspace, the rules of engagement are still being established.\nQ: But isn't it theft? Isn't it manipulation of government -- government materials, be it DNC, be it RNC, be it here at the White House?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I'll let the intelligence community speak to the scope of the materials that may have been compromised. What I'm trying to address in your question is sort of the broader policy implications. And this is one of the things that makes dealing with cyber threats so challenging, is the parameters of engagement are not as well established.\nAnd the U.S. is mindful, as we consider the approach that's necessary to protect the United States, of establishing a framework and establishing a precedent that is clearly in the best interest of the United States.\nSo we'll work through that. And as we do, the thing that the American people can be confident in is that the extraordinary capabilities that are retained by the United States that far exceed the capabilities that can be deployed by any other country will be used to protect our democracy and our system of conducting elections. So people can be confident in our ability to protect our system, in part because it's hard to hack. Our election system is very decentralized. We essentially have 50 different states, and in some cases, individual localities within those states that operate their own system of registering voters, of distributing ballots, and of counting them.\nThat makes it, in some cases, hard to implement reforms across the country because the systems are so different, but it also makes it hard to use one particular strategy to hack those systems because the systems are all so different. In some cases, the systems are pretty old. And, again, in some cases, that means casting a vote can be a little inconvenient. But, again, it also means that those systems can be harder to undermine through the Internet.\nSo that's why we believe that people can be confident in the integrity of the election system. We're also quite interested in working closely with elections administrators to help them take additional steps to further safeguard their systems. And I know that there are at least 33 states that have already been in touch with the Department of Homeland Security to discuss and evaluate any potential vulnerabilities to their system and take steps to remedy them. I know that there are about a dozen or so localities or individual -- or local elections administrators that have also been in touch with federal officials who have the expertise that can be provided to help them safeguard their systems.\nSo we certainly want to encourage elections administrators in other jurisdictions that haven't been in touch with the federal government to reach out and coordinate with the Department of Homeland Security to ensure that necessary steps are being taken to protect their system. But overall, we believe people should have a lot of confidence in the ability of the United States to conduct a free and fair election.\nQ: Is this about states, the White House, political parties, people on the Hill -- is this just about opening an email that could have a virus? Or is it more? Is it more intricate? Because I'm hearing for good cyber hygiene many people have been told do not open certain emails.\nMR. EARNEST: For the advice that DHS is providing to elections administrators, I'd refer you to them. I think in many cases it's more complicated than just opening email.\nQ: All right. And also, now on the campaign trail, when should we expect the First Lady and the President, both together or each one separately, to stand with Hillary Clinton?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as we've discussed here earlier, April, sometimes having them appear together is failing to capitalize on one of the most significant benefits of having the endorsement of the President and First Lady. For some surrogates who announced their endorsement of Secretary Clinton, if they're going to go give a public speech, sometimes it's hard for them to attract a crowd, let alone media attention. President Obama doesn't have that issue. President Obama went to Greensboro yesterday, and more than 7,000 people showed up to hear him speak. A large number of media organizations, especially in North Carolina, showed up to cover his speech. That is something that benefitted the Clinton campaign, without the candidate herself having to be involved.\nSo that's the real value of having somebody as high-profile as the President or the First Lady on the stump campaigning for you, is that you don't have to also go there in order to get attention -- you've got somebody else there who can make a forceful case in support of your candidacy. So I wouldn't rule out that there may be a future opportunity for the President to appear alongside his hoped-for successor. But right now, we're focused on -- the President is focused on doing as much as he can, on his own, to support her campaign and to help her get her message out.\nQ: And last question. How personal is it for this President and this First Lady, with all the issues that Donald Trump has been facing with women, all these accusations and the tapes and things -- how personal is it for both of them?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, you heard the President talk about it last night, and I think you could tell that he was speaking about some deeply and strongly held values, in talking about the comments and conduct of the Republican nominee. And I think you can ascribe those same strong feelings and deeply held values to the First Lady as well.\nBill.\nQ: So President Putin is quoted as saying today that \"hysterics have been whipped up to distract the attention of the American people from the essence of what the hackers have released. For some reason, nobody talks about this. They talk about who did it. Is it really that important?\"\nMR. EARNEST: I think it is important for people to know that the intelligence community of the United States has concluded that Russia is stealing emails and disclosing them in an attempt to destabilize our political system. That is an important piece of information.\nQ: He goes on to say that it's flattering that Russia is getting all this attention.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, he's -- (laughter) -- he's certainly allowed to draw his own conclusions about curating his public image. He apparently has some unique criteria for evaluating his public image.\nWhat we're focused on is making sure that the democratic institutions and our system of government is not threatened by actions that are taken by adversaries overseas. And the United States is prepared to defend our electoral system, and people can be confident that the United States has the capability to make good on that promise to protect our system.\nQ: So you're saying that Russia's an adversary?\nMR. EARNEST: Not for the first time, particularly when it comes to their activities in cyberspace. I think they make it pretty clear that that's -- that the actions that they take are adverse to the actions of the United States, particularly if you're trying to undermine our system of government, or at least destabilize it.\nQ: Do you find it odd that the President of Russia is actually sort of blowing smoke on this?\nMR. EARNEST: Not the first time that he has had some curious explanations for Russia's activities.\nAs we discussed yesterday, Russia is in a tough spot. They've only got one military base outside of the former Soviet bloc. And it's in a nation that is crumbling. And the Russian government has been forced to deploy extensive resources -- military and financial -- to try to protect that military base and try to protect, essentially, the puppet government that they've been supporting there for some time.\nAnd their efforts to do that have drawn the scorn of the international community and left Russia feeling isolated -- so isolated, in fact, that President Putin didn't feel comfortable showing up to dedicate a church in France. That's not the body language of somebody who is particularly comfortable with their public image. So it appears to me that he would have much more of a reason to distract from the current state of affairs than just about anybody else.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I want to follow up for just a second. I've heard the President use the expression \"proportional.\" I've heard Secretary Kerry use it as well. For the people that aren't awash in policy -- they don't live in Washington -- they might have trouble understanding what that might mean with respect to responding to the apparent Russian hacks. What does that mean?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, trying to further define that word I think would only engage in or prompt more public discussion of something that, frankly, we're not prepared to discuss publicly. As I mentioned yesterday, the kind of proportional response that the President would consider is not necessarily the kind of response that we would announce in advance, or maybe even announce ever.\nSo the President will consider a range of options in terms of determining what is appropriate or proportional. But what we surely will do is deploy all the necessary resources to protect our system, and to prevent the Russians from succeeding in their attempt to undermine our political system and undermine our political process.\nThe essence of U.S. and American democracy is that every eligible citizen should have an opportunity to cast a vote and to have that vote counted, and to have a say in how our country is led. And that's a principle that's enshrined in our Constitution, and it's a principle that this government will defend.\nQ: Let me ask you about Aleppo -- the Russians and others apparently continuing to assault the people there in the last 24 hours. What's your response to the devastation there -- in particular, dozens more killed?\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah. We continue to see the Assad regime, with the support of the Russian government, engage in depraved tactics that target civilians, attempting to bomb them into submission to collect military gains on the ground. It is immoral. It is heinous. It is something that tugs at the conscience of everybody who's paying attention. It is profoundly tragic. It has had an impact on a whole generation of Syrians, and its impact has reverberated across the region and even around the world, both in the form of terrorism, but also in the form of a migration crisis, the likes of which we've not seen since World War II.\nSo the consequences are significant. And that's why you can continue to see the United States engage diplomatically through the U.N., through the International Syria Support Group, through our allies in Europe and through our partners in the region to try to cobble together a diplomatic response that can reduce, if not end, the violence inside of Syria, allow for the provision of humanitarian assistance, and kick-start a political process that would lead to a government in Syria that reflects the will and ambition of the Syrian people.\nQ: You mentioned the U.N. I want to get your reaction to something. Vladimir Putin today said the resolution in the U.N. Security Council over the weekend calling for a ceasefire, which I'm sure you're aware of, was simply aimed at exacerbating the situation and whipping up anti-Russian hysteria -- anti-Russia hysteria. What's the White House reaction to that?\nMR. EARNEST: The only country on the Security Council that agreed with him on that is Venezuela. The rest of the world agreed with the United States that that U.N. Security Council resolution would send a forceful message about the need to end the violence inside of Syria. So, yet again, we've highlighted a situation in which Russia is standing alone and is the target of rebuke and scorn by the rest of the international community.\nSo, again -- and I recognize that President Putin says he's not particularly concerned about his public image, but maybe he should be.\nQ: Last one. There's been some conversation that Russia and Syria, in particular, are trying to finish off Aleppo now because there's a feeling that because the President is in the waning days, essentially -- waning months of his presidency, that he's less likely to be fully engaged there, that he is less likely to take a strong action against them in Aleppo. What's your reaction to such suggestions?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the President's approach to the situation has been remarkably consistent. And the President has been willing to use military force in the context of our Counter-ISIL Coalition against extremists, including ISIL in Iraq and in Syria. But from the beginning, the United States has sought to pursue a diplomatic solution based on our belief that there's no military solution to the chaos and violence that we see inside of Syria.\nAnd so our pursuit of this diplomacy continues unabated. That's the reason for Secretary Kerry's travel to Europe later this week. And those who underestimate the will and determination of the President of the United States to pursue our national interests do so at their own peril.\nRon.\nQ: Just a couple of quick ones. Does \"senior Russian government officials\" include Vladimir Putin?\nMR. EARNEST: I will allow everyone to draw their own conclusions and their own analysis of the analysis that was released by the U.S. intelligence community. I was not with them when they drafted the statement, but I'm sure that they drafted\n-- they played close attention to the words that were used in drafting the statement. So I'll let them say, if they want to say, whether or not the knowledge and complicity of senior government officials that they're referring to includes the president of that country.\nQ: What's the White House view? Obviously, you have a view of that.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, well, the White House view is that we're going to let the intelligence professionals speak to what they know, and if they're prepared to tell you more, then they can do so.\nQ: In the case of the 33 states and 12 other entities that have asked for help from DHS, can you describe -- was there damage that was done? Or are they trying to get ahead of a problem? Or, again, in layman's terms, I'm just trying to understand what the situation was there. Was there some harm done, or are they just trying to proactively get ahead of a situation?\nMR. EARNEST: They are primarily trying to get ahead of the situation and trying to coordinate with state and local officials to protect their systems. Obviously there's --\nQ: So no systems have been breached or harmed? There's been nothing --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'll let DHS or individual election administrators speak to the integrity of their system. But the steps that DHS has taken have included things like scans of the Internet-facing systems that are maintained by election agencies. They can conduct risk and vulnerability assessments to determine what sort of risk these individual systems may be facing and then help them take steps to remedy or reduce or mitigate those risks.\nThere's also been sharing of best practices. Obviously, DHS has now been in touch with 33 different states about measures that they've taken to shore up their systems. Some of the best practices that they've learned in shoring up those systems can be used in other states to shore up their systems. So that is the kind of thing that experts at DHS have been involved with. But all of that work has been done at the invitation of, and in close cooperation with, state and local officials who are responsible for administering their elections.\nThe one thing I want to just hasten to add here is that this is not a situation where the federal government is prepared to take over the administration of these systems. That's not the aim of DHS. That certainly is not the expertise that they have. The expertise that they can provide is to offer technical assistance and specific advice to individual administrators who do have this responsibility so they can make sure that these elections are undertaken in a way that preserves people's confidence in the system.\nQ: Just one on that. You used the word -- or the intelligence experts do -- \"destabilize\" the U.S. political system -- not a word like \"influence.\" So is what's been happening, does there seem to be a clear purpose or a clear objective? Or is it just random, just to cause chaos? The point being, is there some attempt to really influence the election in one direction or another, or is this just sort of random, hey, we're going to gum up the works and make people feel like it's not -- like they don't have confidence in the system?\nMR. EARNEST: For a better explanation of that, again, I'd refer you to the intelligence community. They're the ones that are looking at the evidence firsthand. They've got the technical wherewithal to draw those kinds of conclusions.\nQ: So the White House hasn't drawn these conclusions. This is certainly, hugely important thing that is on everyone's mind 20-some-odd days.\nMR. EARNEST: It is, and that's frankly why we're relying on our intelligence experts to share as much evidence and information as they can about what exactly is happening. And we have certainly supported them in their effort to make this information public so that the American public can be informed about what's happening, but also so election administrators and others can take the appropriate steps to safeguard their systems. That's why we're sharing this information, and that's what we have tried to describe to people.\nQ: And lastly, there was a plane crash in Connecticut, and the pilot -- or the one survivor says it was intentional. How concerned is the White House about this being a possible act of terrorism?\nMR. EARNEST: What I know now is that the FBI has indicated that they're going to join the investigation into what exactly happened. So it's too early for me to issue any pronouncements about what may have contributed to that crash, but investigators at the FBI are certainly going to take a close look at all of the potential causes to determine what exactly happened.\nQ: There's a lot of reasons why a plane could crash intentionally. So there's nothing initially that indicates terrorism one way or the other?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know what the FBI has learned thus far. So we'll let them conduct their investigation and see if they can share with us a little bit more about what may have been going on there.\nAndrew.\nQ: I wanted to follow up on the Russia questions. Does the President still think that Russia is just a regional power, given the hacking of the U.S. election, the war in Syria, the kind of prevarications at the U.N.?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware that the President's assessment has changed, and I don't think there's anything that we have seen from the Russians that would lead to a reappraisal of their standing in the international community. If anything, Russia has been further marginalized because of their tactics in Ukraine and in Syria and in cyberspace. The rest of the international community has rebuked Russia for their targeting of civilians inside of Syria. The rest of the international community has imposed sanctions against Russia because of their flagrant violation of Ukrainian sovereignty.\nMany democracies in the West have expressed deep concerns with Russian attempts to meddle and influence, if not undermine, the basic functioning of their democracy. So in each case, you have the international community expressing grave concerns with Russia's conduct. That, I think, is telling in describing the kinds of limitations that Russia has encountered as they pursue much broader ambitions.\nQ: I guess the West or the international community finds Russia's behavior irritating. It doesn't mean they're not powerful.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the United States derives a lot of our power and influence and authority around the world by being able to skillfully and effectively cooperate with other countries in pursuit of shared objectives. That's the way that the United States has advanced our interests around the world. When the United States was just -- let's just do one example. When the United States became deeply concerned about the Iranian attempt to obtain a nuclear weapon, President Obama encountered a situation where the nation of Iran was united in pursuit of that goal and the international community was fractured in trying to figure out how to confront it.\nSo President Obama did what countries with significant influence around the world do, which is he marshaled the world to confront Iran in a way that benefitted the United States. Now, it also happened to benefit other countries around the world. That's why the United States was able to demonstrate that kind of leadership. And the world would not have come together to confront Iran in the way that the world did had the President and the United States not shown such leadership.\nA similar analogy could be drawn around the international agreement to cut carbon pollution. That is the kind of agreement that benefits the world. But it also benefits the United States and our economy in a variety of ways that we've discussed here at some length.\nThose are two examples where the United States played the kind of leading role with the international community that, frankly, Russia would be unable to do.\nNow, part of Russia's reduced influence is derived from the fact that their economy is smaller than Spain's. Some of it is derived from the fact that Russia has a rather sordid record when it comes to basic universal human rights. But, Andrew, some of it also has to do with the fact that Russia has found itself marginalized in the international community because of their actions in Syria, and Ukraine, and in cyberspace. And that's just a fact.\nAnd I recognize that's inconsistent with some of the ambitions that are articulated by leaders in the Russian government, but it's true. And I guess the other telling example, then I'll stop -- the other telling example is that Russia for more than a year has sought U.S. cooperation against extremists inside of Syria. They've been unable to get it, in large part because they aren't able to keep their promises.\nWhen the United States sought cooperation with other countries to go after ISIL and other extremists inside of Syria, we formed a coalition of 66 nations. Russia has a coalition with Iran and the Assad regime and maybe Venezuela, based on their vote at the U.N. Security Council resolution. I don't really know what that gets you. It certainly gets you diminished influence and a much smaller coalition than is exercised by a country like the United States that is able to work effectively with countries around the world in pursuit of shared goals in a way that enhances the national security interests of the United States.\nQ: I have a more concrete question. It's been reported that investigators, U.S. investigators, believe Russia targeted a contractor in Florida's electoral system, potentially exposing voter data. I was wondering if you have any information about that.\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't seen that report, but we can follow up with you on it. Okay?\nStephanie.\nQ: Thank you. No one -- pretty much anyone, can get their emails hacked. There are so many people out there are willing to publish them. Does the White House have any policies about email, about email behavior for people in and around the administration? Basically, what is the administration's advice for email for all of us?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, obviously when it comes to government employees, our expectation is that you're going to use your government system for government work. And the resources of the United States government are then deployed to protect those email systems. Much of the material that's been released in recent days has been personal email accounts that are maintained by individuals on broader networks that are not -- that don't have the same kinds of government defenses in place.\nThere are common-sense things that people can do like not clicking on links that are contained in emails sent from unknown users. There are other steps that people can take in terms of two-factor authentication that make it harder for people to gain unauthorized access to your account.\nThose are the kinds of common-sense steps that people -- that experts recommend everyone should consider as they send and receive email.\nQ: Since negotiations for the ceasefire ended with Russia -- we talked a lot about that today -- but John Kerry calling for a war crimes investigation. What is -- in simplest terms, what is the -- what is Plan B for the U.S.?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I would point out that there have been other movements at the U.N. to work through the Security Council to ensure that the Assad regime and Russia are held accountable for some of their actions -- I should say, I believe it's just the Assad regime -- but basically said there have been actions through the U.N. taken to hold the Assad regime accountable for potential war crimes. Russia has vetoed that effort and used their veto on the Security Council to prevent the referral of information, for example, to the International Criminal Court.\nSo the United States is deeply concerned about the situation in Syria. And the willingness of the Assad regime to target hospitals, to pursue a strategy that, at its root, is nothing more than bombing civilians into submission, is immoral and something that, as Secretary Kerry said, potentially a war crime. And the United States believes in accountability, and we'll pursue that accountability through the avenues that are available to us.\nChris.\nQ: Josh, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals yesterday agreed to reconsider whether the prohibition on gender discrimination in federal civil rights law applies to lesbian, gay, and bisexual people. I've asked you whether President Obama believes it does before, but you didn't have an answer. In the aftermath of the 7th Circuit decision to litigate this issue over the course of the Obama administration, will President Obama affirm Title VII bars sexual orientation discrimination in the workforce?\nMR. EARNEST: Chris, I have to admit, I have not been briefed on that specific ruling so let me take a look at it and we'll get back to you, okay?\nQ: Given President Obama's efforts to advance LGBT rights in his administration, why wouldn't his people naturally say that anti-gay discrimination is barred under current law?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I don't know how the law works with regard to this particular legal question, so let me see if we can get somebody who is more keenly aware of the legal issues here to get back to you.\nQ: All arguments in this case are set for November 30th. Would you anticipate having any answer before that?\nMR. EARNEST: I'll look into it and see if we can.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, when the President does campaign rallies like the one yesterday in Greensboro, is there a White House policy governing the display of the presidential seal on the lectern at political events like that?\nMR. EARNEST: What is typically, though not always, the case is the seal is not displayed. There have been certain situations where it has been displayed, but usually at those events it's not.\nQ: Well, of the three rallies he has done so far -- Charlotte, Philadelphia and yesterday -- it's been displayed twice. What criteria is used to decide when to use it and when not?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't spoken to our advance team about the decision that was made yesterday with regard to the seal. I think what you've illustrated is that there's not a hard and fast policy with regard to the display of the seal. But I think everybody knows who is talking when the President is giving a speech at those rallies.\nQ: What about at fundraisers?\nMR. EARNEST: I think it's the same, which is that it's usually --\nQ: Sometimes, and sometimes not?\nMR. EARNEST: I think I would describe it as usually not displayed at fundraisers, but we can double-check on that for you.\nQ: Please.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay.\nQ: On the three radio interviews he's doing today, are those \"Get Out the Vote\" interviews?\nMR. EARNEST: Those are -- you may have noted that they're in specific locations. Do you have the information? There's one in Cleveland and two in Miami. I know in Florida the President was using the occasion of those interviews to encourage people to register to vote. There was a ruling from a federal judge that -- Chris, that was one ruling that I actually was briefed on -- (laughter) -- which is a judge in Florida did extend the deadline for voter registration by five or six days to give people who may have been affected by Hurricane Matthew the opportunity to register to vote in Florida. And what the President has long said is that we believe that we should be looking for ways to make it easier for eligible citizens and eligible voters to register and cast a vote. So that obviously was a decision that the President welcomed.\nSo the President went on the radio to make sure that people were aware of the decision and to encourage them to take advantage of the newfound opportunity that they have to use the next five days or six days to get registered to vote.\nQ: And one last one. The calendar shows that tomorrow begins the last 100 days of his presidency. Is he aware of that? Does somebody keep track of -- is there a countdown calendar in the West Wing? (Laughter.) And does he have any special plans or hopes or objectives for these last 100 days?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I'm not aware that he knows that tomorrow will be -- sort of kick off the clock for 100 days left. But after this exchange, I suspect he will be informed.\nLook, I think the President is approaching the final 100 days the way that he approached the previous seven and a half years or so, which is seeking to make the most of every remaining opportunity to use the power of this office to advance the interests of this country, to fight for middle-class families, and to keep our country safe. And the President -- part of that is advocating for a successor who is committed to those values and those principles. Part of that is capitalizing on whatever materializes in the lame duck session of Congress to continue to move this agenda forward. Part of that is devoting the time and attention to detail that's required to ensure a smooth transition to the next President, regardless of who it is.\nSo those are all priorities for the next 100 days, and I know the President is looking forward to making the most of every moment that's remaining, and then, as you mentioned yesterday, getting the chance to catch up on some sleep.\nQ: He mentioned that twice. Is he sleep-deprived? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: We've had this conversation before. (Laughter.) I think the President is certainly looking forward to sleeping a little longer than usual after he leaves the White House.\nDave.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Speaking of the Greensboro rally yesterday, there were some demonstrators who appeared to be pro-Trump supporters -- or at least anti-Bill Clinton people who got pretty close to the stage from the looks of it. Did that cause any concern here at the White House?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any concern that was expressed. I know that there was obviously ample security there, both from the Secret Service but also from local law enforcement. And I'm not aware of any particular heightened concern about the event yesterday.\nQ: And the President seemed a little looser at that rally in his comments, or maybe a little -- maybe I'm reading into it, but a little less concerned about the outcome of the election. He was making some farcical comments. He seemed a little more --\nMR. EARNEST: Did it seem like the shackles were off? (Laughter.)\nQ: It did. (Laughter.) And I'm wondering, does he feel like, basically, it's all over but the voting?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I think the passion, particularly in the closing portion of the President's remarks, I think indicates that the President is feeling confident about the election, but he's determined to make sure that people don't get complacent about the outcome of the election. That is his focus. And the stakes are far too high for people to be complacent, particularly people who have been such strong and loyal supporters of President Obama for the last eight years. Those individuals have so much at stake in terms of seeing what they fought for, for the last eight years, not torn down by a Republican candidate that's promising to do just that. So that's the essence of the President's case.\nSo the President feels good about the broader trends. But the stakes are so high, we can't take a single vote for granted. And the President certainly is not taking any votes for granted, and that's why he's going to spend a good portion of the next couple of days campaigning for his successor. The First Lady will be in New Hampshire tomorrow. And over the last three weeks that remain until Election Day, I think you can expect to see both of them continuing to work hard and make a forceful case in support of a successor that shares his values.\nQ: One question. I want to follow up on Syria. Back in 2014, when the President was with his advisors devising a plan for fighting ISIS in Syria, can you say, did he benefit from the advice of former Secretary Clinton?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware that there were extensive consultations between President Obama and the former Secretary of State in 2014 on this issue.\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as you know, Dave, they've had an opportunity to meet for lunch and to have some conversations since she left her role as the Secretary of State. Most of those conversations are not focused on work, but I can't rule out that part of their lunchtime conversation may have been about the difficult choices that the President is facing in Syria.\nBut there's no sort of protracted or regular dialogue to tell you about in terms of the advice that he received from his former Secretary of State. He's got a robust national security team that's in place that's focused on these issues every day that he gets advice from. And quite frankly, Secretary Clinton had other things that she was focusing on, in terms of starting up her presidential campaign.\nQ: I know you're not addressing the Podesta emails specifically, but the reason I ask is there's an email in there where she lays out a nine-point plan specifically for the White House, the administration to defeat ISIS in Syria.\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I can't speak to the authenticity of that email. Again, I wouldn't rule out that there may have been an exchange of views, but no sort of sustained dialogue on these issues between the President and Secretary Clinton after she left office.\nJane, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. On North Korea -- North Korean human rights abuse. There are over 29,000 North Korean defectors currently living in South Korea away from North Korea's Kim Jong-un. How do you think of North Korean defectors continue to come into U.S. or South Korea?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me first start by addressing the humanitarian situation in North Korea is deeply, deeply troubling. We got a government in North Korea that seeks to enrich itself, even in the face of some of the toughest sanctions regimes in the world, at the expense of the civilian population. They've got millions of people in North Korea who face daily, austere poverty, all while the government officials continue to enjoy the luxury of a wealthy lifestyle.\nSo that raises some pretty serious moral questions. It also indicates a failing at the responsibility that any government has to look out for the best interests of their citizens. And that would explain the flow of defectors that we have seen. I can't speak to any specific policy changes that are being contemplated by the United States with regard to defectors from North Korea. And I'd refer you to the South Korean government for a discussion of the way those individuals are treated when they arrive in South Korea.\nQ: Do you think North Korea's Kim Jong-un must go to ICC, International Criminal Court?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware if the United States has taken a formal position on this issue, but obviously the flagrant violation of human rights inside of North Korea is something that is of deep concern, not just in the United States but any other country and any other person around the world that prioritizes the protection of universal human rights.\nOkay. Thanks, everybody.\nEND 2:22 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2016-10-12", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122581", "text": "This week in Rotterdam, the United States will join the Netherlands and other participants in the 55-country Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA), as well as non-governmental organizations, foundations, and private sector stakeholders, as they take collective action to address epidemic threats. The GHSA is a signature global health and national security priority for President Obama. It was launched in 2014 – before the first cases of Ebola in West Africa came to light – due to leadership of the United States and partners from every region of the world. In only three years, the GHSA has sparked historic commitments and kindled new momentum to establish global capacity to address devastating outbreaks – whether naturally occurring, deliberate, or accidental. Equally important, the GHSA involves all sectors of government and engages leaders from around the world – the level of commitment required to prevent, detect, and respond to biological threats that cross borders in an increasingly globalized world. The GHSA has also ignited innovative and historic common targets and tools so that all countries can better share information, know where they stand, measure progress using the same metrics, and work collectively to fill remaining gaps.\nUnder President Obama's leadership, the commitment of the United States to advance the GHSA is second to none. When the GHSA was launched, only approximately 30 percent of all countries were able to report that they had the necessary capacities in place to address public health emergencies. Since the launch of the GHSA in 2014, 17 at-risk countries are receiving $1 billion in United States assistance to address epidemic threats, 31 countries and the Caribbean Community are developing 5-year plans with common targets and milestones to measure outcomes, the G-7 Leaders have made a collective commitment to assist 76 countries and regions, 18 countries – including the United States – will have undergone a World Health Organization (WHO) Joint External Evaluation (JEE) by the end of this week, and over 30 additional countries are scheduled to do so.\nAdditionally, even as we respond with urgency to today's outbreaks, we must be smart enough to think ahead, and bold enough to invest in future solutions. One of the ways we are doing that is by sourcing innovations through USAID's Combatting Zika and Future Threats Grand Challenge. This week, USAID announced a second set of awards to combat future threats. From issuing new technology to deliver critical medical supplies in remote areas to the use of big data to prevent future disease outbreaks, innovators across the globe are responding with solutions to tackle the outbreaks of today and strengthen our position in the fight against the outbreaks of tomorrow.\nBut much remains to be done, and all countries must play a major role in their own preparedness and in assisting those that cannot become prepared on their own. Accordingly, the GHSA is becoming increasingly relevant as the United States fights Zika at home and abroad and as it partners with other countries to combat antimicrobial resistance, rebuild health systems in West Africa, and remain vigilant against the threat of bioterrorism. We call on all countries and partners to work together across all sectors and at the highest levels of government to achieve the vision of the GHSA: a world safe and secure from infectious disease threats.\nUnited States Commitments and Next Steps to Advance the GHSA\nThe United States is committed to achieving all of the GHSA targets at home, assisting other countries to achieve these goals and working cooperatively with governments, international organizations, and non-governmental stakeholders to enhance global capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to biological threats, whether naturally occurring, deliberate, or accidental. This includes implementation of the International Health Regulations (IHR) and other relevant global health security frameworks such as the Performance of Veterinary Services Pathway of the World Organization for Animal Health.\nU.S. commitment to partner with 31 countries and the Caribbean Community to achieve the GHSA targets\nThe United States has made bilateral commitments to partner with 31 countries and the Caribbean Community to achieve the targets of the GHSA, including the development of five-year national Roadmaps. In July 2015, the U.S. government  announced its intent to invest more than $1 billion in resources to expand the GHSA to prevent, detect, and respond to future infectious disease outbreaks in 17 partner countries. To date, all of these countries have completed assessments of GHSA target capacities and have designed five-year Roadmaps that reflect input from multiple sectors, including health, agriculture, livestock, development partners, and non-governmental stakeholders. In addition, most of the Roadmaps have been published on GHSAgenda.org, demonstrating country commitment to transparency and the achievement of GHSA targets. In addition, the United States is partnering with 13 additional countries, as well as the Caribbean region, to design Roadmaps and forge the partnerships needed to achieve the GHSA targets.\nU.S. commitment to external assessments\nThe United States supports the JEE and its targets. In 2016, the United States underwent and published a  Joint External Evaluation (JEE) for IHR implementation. Further, the United States is actively providing technical and financial resources to implement JEE assessments in countries around the world. In 2014, during the GHSA Summit at the White House, five countries volunteered to undergo a pilot external assessment. In 2015, Finland, the United States, and other GHSA partners developed and tested 11 GHSA targets and a GHSA assessment tool, which was finalized during the September 2015  GHSA High Level Meeting in Seoul. Building on the GHSA assessment tool, the WHO released the JEE tool in early 2016. The tool contains the GHSA targets as well as other measures of national capability to implement the IHR.\nLeveraging U.S. Leadership toward global preparedness\nDuring the 2016 G-7 Leaders' Summit at Ise Shima, G-7 Leaders reinforced support for a coordinated approach to help 76 countries and regions build the capability to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats. Specifically, the G-7 will offer to assist partners in developing national plans and will measure progress according to the targets of the JEE tool, which includes each of the targets of the GHSA.\nPreventing Future Outbreaks from Becoming Epidemics: Since its launch in 2014, the GHSA has brought together partners and sectors from over 50 countries and international organizations around the world to enhance global capacities to prevent, detect, and rapidly respond to infectious disease threats by achieving measurable targets. The GHSA Steering Group includes 10 countries, chaired in 2015 by Finland, in 2016 by Indonesia, and in 2017 by the Republic of Korea. The GHSA Steering Group currently includes: Canada, Chile, Finland, India, Indonesia, Italy, Kenya, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Republic of Korea, and the United States.\nThe GHSA invests in needed capacity – infrastructure, equipment, and skilled personnel across sectors – and enhances coordination and commitment for countries, international organizations, and civil society to work together to achieve the following specific targets: Countering antimicrobial resistance; preventing the emergence and spread of zoonotic disease; advancing a whole-of-government national biosafety and biosecurity system in every country; improving immunization; establishing a national laboratory system; strengthening real-time biosurveillance; advancing timely and accurate disease reporting; establishing a trained global health security workforce; establishing emergency operations centers; linking public health, law and multi-sectoral rapid response; and enhancing medical countermeasures and personnel deployment.\nAs the Ebola outbreak in West Africa reached epidemic levels in September 2014, the White House hosted a high-level meeting with 44 countries to announce over 100 commitments to strengthen capabilities under the GHSA. In 2015, the Republic of Korea hosted the second high-level event to bring together countries and organizations participating in the GHSA to highlight new commitments and progress. This week in Rotterdam, the Netherlands is hosting the third GHSA high-level event to highlight and implement country commitments. These high-level meetings, and the commitments formed and implemented through them, help to achieve a world safe and secure from infectious disease threats.", "timestamp": "2016-10-12", "title": "Fact Sheet: United States Leadership to Advance the Global Health Security Agenda: 55 countries show concrete commitment to prevent, detect, and respond"}

[applause]\nI'll tell you the same thing, however, the only people that will be shown on television won't be the 15,000 people, it'll be this group right over here. [applause]\nSo, the good news is, you have better seats, or standing room only, but you have better, but they're going to be more famous, right? They're going to be more famous. [applause]\nLook, we want to have the cameras circle around and show this crowd, will you do that cameras? [applause]\nGo ahead cameras. [applause]\nThey never do it. They never do it, so we won't waste our time, it's just the dishonest media. Look. [applause]\nWe love being here, I love being with you. I love this state, as you know, I'm here all the time. [applause]\nIn 27 days, we're going to win Florida [applause]\nand we're going to win back the White House. [applause]\nAnd that's what's happening folks, that's what's happening. [applause]\nWe're going to bring back our jobs, we're going to end illegal immigration, we're going to renegotiate our totally disastrous I mean these deals, aye yai yai the trade deals the worst. We're going to renegotiate those trade deals, reduce surging crime. You saw what happened the other day, murders in the United States, the highest level in 45 years. You don't hear that from the press. [booing]\nWe're going to cut taxes big league. Crooked Hillary is going to raise taxes. We're going to cut taxes and regulations. We're going to reduce the costs of education. By the way, we're going end the Common Core, and we're bringing our education local. [applause]\nWe're going to lift the restrictions on American Energy and deliver real change for our great American people; it's time. [applause]\nAnd when it comes to international government, to massive trade deals, and to America's borders, we're going to defend the freedom and sovereignty of the United States of America like never before. [applause]\nAnd we are going to once again put America first. [applause]\nThe deadline for voter register who is not registered? Is there anybody in here not registered? If you're not registered, get the hell out of here, OK? [applause]\nThere's a nice looking young guy hey listen, leave right now and go and register. [applause]\nThey just extended it for a little while, so right after you, raise your right hand. Do you promise you're going to register after this? If you like what I say, OK, if you like what I say. [applause]\nSeriously, I'm curious, who is not registered in this room? OK, all young people. Believe me, the young people like me better than Bernie, I'm telling you. [applause]\nBecause with me, when you graduate from college, you're going to come out and you're going to have a vast array of jobs. OK, right? [applause]\nSo go out and register, and we're going to have an awfully big I'll tell you what, honestly, we're going to have a big four years, eight years, we're going to have a big, great future for our country. [applause]\nAlso, you can request an absentee ballot and you can vote by mail, if necessary. So, register, request a ballot.\nThank you. I love you. I love you, too.\nThe Hillary Clinton documents have you been seeing this, what's going on? Released by WikiLeaks make more clear than ever just how much is at stake in November and how unattractive and dishonest our country has become.\nThe election of Hillary Clinton would lead, in my opinion, to the almost total destruction of our country as we know it. She would be the most dishonest and the most corrupt person ever elected to high office. And I don't think it would be close.\nThe WikiLeaks e-mails show the Department of Justice fed information, did you see this? to the Clinton campaign.\nSo think of this. The Department of Justice, you remember that whole deal with Wild Bill getting on the back of an airplane, just happened to be in Arizona.\nHe was gonna play golf. It was 110 degrees.\nBut he gets on the back of the airplane to meet with the Attorney General to talk about his golf game and to talk about his grandkids. He was there for 39 minutes. [booing]\nI think most of us know what happened. [booing]\nSo fed information, Department of Justice fed information think of this to the Clinton campaign about the e-mail investigation so that the campaign could be prepared to cover up her crimes. Now, did you ever hear [booing]\nDid you ever hear anything like this? [booing]\nAnd, and by the way, these dishonest people, mainstream media, they don't talk about this. They don't talk about this. Now, if I sneeze if Donald Trump sneezes today, it's a major story. [applause]\nHere you have Department of Justice coming to see them to brief them prior to their interview. Folks, this is out of control.\nAnd the FBI unbelievable people. You have incredible people in the FBI. I would be willing to be that they are so ashamed of what's happened at the upper level.\nI would be willing to bet that they don't even sleep at night.\nThese are great people. These are great Americans. And they can't believe what's going on.\nThis corruption and collision is just one more reason why I will ask my Attorney General to appoint a special prosecutor. [applause]\nOur country has never been so low. In addition to a special prosecutor to look into what happened and all of the corruption, and all of the we'll say so called crime.\nBut look, when somebody deletes 33,000 e-mails after getting a subpoena. But we have to also remember this remember this. This is maybe in a sense even more important.\nWe have to investigate the investigation. [applause]\nWe have to investigate the investigation. [applause]\nWe've never had a case like this. And even Congress, you know, is sort of they've never had this before, because there's no event like this that ever took place.\nNormally, Congress you know she lied to Congress. She lied to the FBI. And remember, he said she was negligent. She was all the things you needed to be, but she lied to Congress, she lied to the FBI, she lied to everybody she even lied in the debates about the gold standard, right.\nRemember, she said, I never said gold standard. And remember when I said line in the sand? She said, I wasn't secretary of state. I said, I think you were, but let's see even the press said she was secretary of state, so she lied about that.\nBut think of this. Think of this. There's never been a time like this in our country. And Congress, in all fairness and I'm so disappointed in them. I am so disappointed in Congress. I am so disappointed. [applause]\nAnd I mean both sides. I'm not talking Republican Dem I'm talking everybody. To allow a thing like this to go this is crime at the highest level. She shouldn't be allowed to run for president. You know that. [applause]\nOther people's lives have been ruined, destroyed, for doing a tiny fraction of what she did. You saw the man with the book, he had to give back all the royalties and went through hell. You saw the man with the picture of the submarine, his mother goes around, she's devastated, devastated. Took pictures of a submarine. And you take a look at this.\nSo we have to investigate the investigation, and Congress but I speak to Congressmen. They don't know what to do. Because normally, they vote and they hand it over to the FBI and the Justice Department. But the FBI and the Justice Department won't do anything, so they don't know what to do. [booing]\nNow, they do make laws. Maybe they have to make up a law for a case like this. But they take these criminal acts, in my opinion, criminal acts, hand them over to the FBI, the FBI actually acknowledge that even, frankly, could have gone that speech could have been 10 times longer.\nBut all of these things yes, she did this, yes, she did this, yes, she did that, yes, she did that, but we're not going to do anything, right but what do you do when you hand them over to the FBI and the Justice Department and that's the end of it? We have never been in a position like this.\nI'm so embarrassed by what's taken place, and I'm very, very disappointed in Congress because our people, our politicians I don't know, do they make a deal where everybody protects each other in Washington? Maybe that's it. I really believe it. I really believe it. I almost say, listen, we're going to leave you alone, but when it's our turn, you have to leave them alone. Do they make deals like this?\nThis is the most heinous, the most serious thing that I've ever seen involving justice in the United States in the history of the United States. We have a person that has committed crimes that is now running for the presidency, and she has the Justice Department, where she essentially told the AG in the speech or a talk that she'd appoint her AG again. And this is the person that's supposed to be ruling?\nFolks, whether I win, lose, or draw, I'm ashamed of what's happened to our country and so are you. [applause]\nHillary Clinton bleached and deleted 33,000 e-mails. And did you see, two days ago, boxes of e-mails and other things were missing? They were missing.\nSo she deleted 33,000 e-mails and bleached them. By the way, nobody bleaches; nobody I have people that are sophisticated in this world. They never even heard of it. They called it acid wash, meaning you can never retrieve them, although I have a feeling that the NSA has them. They don't want them. They don't want to get them. I have a feeling. [applause]\nSo then she did this after, not before. Before would be bad. She did this after getting a congressional subpoena.\nNow, if your friend is suing you in a regular lawsuit, and you do that, you go to jail. Here's the United States Congress subpoenas her e-mails and other things, and she deletes the e-mails, saying there are 33,000 e-mails remember? for the wedding and for yoga classes 33,000 e-mails. [applause]\nAnd then and then after all of that, now they're missing two boxes of perhaps the most important of the group.\nAnd what about her law firm? You know what? She's using a phenomenal law firm. I know the firm. Phenomenal law firm. They're the ones that did all this stuff. Remember, they said we made a ruling they were work-related. You can't do that. If they're work- related, what you do is you show them you show them and you get them. It's a law firm nobody ever mentions. The law firm is unbelievable. It's very powerful. OK?\nObviously, they've done a great job. But that law firm should be implicated in this crime. OK? [applause]\nThey're the ones they got rid of all this stuff. The law firm got rid of all this stuff. And they should be implicated because they have committed a crime. They are not supposed to say, \"Oh, we got rid of most of it.\" That law firm that I know very well, as I said total professionals, total insiders they got rid of 33,000 and much more than that. It is one of the great miscarriages of justice.\nSo then she destroyed her phones, some with a hammer, to cover up her crimes. Now, how many of you people have gotten rid of cell phones and you start whacking them with a hammer? Has any please raise your hand? Please. One. What business are you in?\nI see two hands. We have 15,000. Two hands. Anybody else? It is so disgraceful. It's so embarrassing. And by the way, we're going to go over some of the WikiLeaks stuff. The press hardly reports it. They hardly report it. She did a big number of Catholics, horrible number on Catholics. She did a horrible number on evangelicals through her people.\nAnd they hardly report it. While she was secretary of state, she lost or disappeared almost $6 billion. Does anyone know that? No. How do you lose $6 billion? Even Chelsea Clinton in the WikiLeaks emails expressed, quote, \"serious concerns about conflicts of interest at the Clinton Foundation and the State Department.\"\nAmericans have had it with the years and decades of Clinton corruption. It's corruption Whitewater, cattle. [applause]\nNever is with these people. Remember years ago most of you are too young to remember. Remember the cattle? She bought some cattle and she had the greatest return, like almost in the history of cattle deals? And some of these professional cattlemen and cattle women they say, boy, she's really good at this stuff. They'd been doing it all their lives, they had never had a return like that. It's corruption, folks. It's corruption.\nThey understood that, by the way. They're smart, they got it very quickly.\nThis will finally be the year the American people say, enough is enough. During a recent trip to Florida, I had a chance to spend some time with the incredible residents of Little Haiti, and you see what's going on in Haiti, it's a horrible thing. And you see what's going on with Clinton, it's a horrible thing. These are not fans of Clinton. That, I can tell you.\nThey despise the Clintons for what they did to the Haitian people. New e-mails revealed by ABC News just yesterday show that during the deadly earthquake in Haiti, which killed over 150,000 people, the Clintons couldn't stop cashing in. They kept cashing in.\nAs people were dying in Haiti, Clinton insiders were separating out requests from friends of Bill or William Jefferson Clinton VIPs so that their business interests or contracts would receive very special treatment, while those who were not special friends would be put permanently on the sidelines.\nAnd remember this. Hillary's brother, running a gold mine, put on the gold Tony, you saw Tony. Tony. Anybody want to hire Tony? He's put on the board of a big gold mine company, having to do with Haiti. It's so bad.\nLook, we're in a rigged system, folks. This is a rigged, rigged system. You saw so many of the things. I'll tell you, this WikiLeaks stuff is unbelievable. It tells you the inner heart you got to read it. And you got to maybe get it, because they're not putting it out. They want to put it out, but they can't do that, because without the media and without the press, Hillary Clinton would be nothing. She'd be nothing. Zero. [applause]\nAnd by the way, did everybody see the debate the other day, yes? [applause]\nSo they had nine online polls. Some of them had us 90 to 10, 80 to 20. \"Time Magazine\" had like a massive look, \"Time Magazine\" is no friend of mine except they put me on the cover so much. Not because they like me, because they like selling magazines.\nBut \"Time Magazine\" it was total destruction. And then the next morning, she walks in and says, did everybody see the debate? People go, yes, yes. Did we beat her or what? I look so forward[applause]\nI do. I look so forward to the next one in Las Vegas.\nAs Haiti's death toll from Hurricane Matthew is on the rise, we should never forget how Bill and Hillary Clinton handled Haiti the last time. To all our friends in Little Haiti they're great people. I mean, I spent a long time these are people that are incredible. They have the warmest feeling, the warmest heart. But to all of our friends in Little Haiti, your day of justice is coming, believe me. [applause]\nAnd it arrives on November 8. November 8, get out and vote.\nThe new e-mails also show members of the Clinton team viciously attacking Catholics and Evangelicals. They attacked Catholics and evangelicals. [booing]\nViciously. [booing]\nAnd that won't be tolerated but it won't be tolerated by the voters. Tell you what anybody of religion I really think you have to vote for Donald Trump to be honest with you. I really do believe it. [applause]\nAnd in all of the primaries you saw that. I wasn't expected to win with evangelicals but once we got started and once they heard my message as opposed to other people's messages we really we won big with evangelicals. They're incredible people. [applause]\nRemember the Johnson Amendment. We're gonna get rid of that Johnson Amendment. Just remember that. [applause]\nThese emails are just the latest evidence of the hatred that the Clinton campaign has for everyday faithful Americans. True. The Wikileaks email show that Hillary Clinton's staff, even has to give her secret notes on when she needs to smile. Smile Hillary. Smile. [applause]\nHey folks, we have to get back to work. Our country's in trouble. We can't play games anymore. Smile. You believe it? Smile. [applause]\nAnd how about where it said to the public you say this, but to the others that give you the money you say that. I'll tell you. It's so revealing somebody's going to do a great book on that, because the press just did not little tiny stories, big, big things. Getting answers for debates and questions for debates, before the debate takes place. How about that?\nI'll tell you what. Can you imagine me, if any of this stuff pertained to me? Front page headlines all over the world, Donald Trump oh well, we've been there and we seem to be doing really well.\nHillary Clinton, commonly referred to as Crooked Hillary, thinks that you all of you are deplorable and totally irredeemable. [applause]\nI actually think irredeemable is worse, I don't know. I'm the only one. Deplorable and irredeemable. Irredeemable meaning, meaning you can never, ever come back. I call you hard-working American patriots, and together we are going to save this country and we are going to make America great again. [applause]\nAnd it's hot as hell in here but I don't care. [applause]\nCall it Florida, right? Florida. [applause]\nEmails also show that the DNC vice-chair was feeding information so much information to the candidate. Oh man, I want that why can't the Republicans do that? Why can't Reince feed me information prior to a debate. I'm so angry at the Republicans I want to be fed information like Hillary gets. [applause]\nAnd we still beat her badly, right? So I mean what's the big deal? But I want information. The Republicans are not doing their job. They should be able to get me all of the questions prior to the debate.\nThis all comes after a secret tape that shows Hillary Clinton calling Bernie voters now look Bernie I feel sorry for Bernie.\nHe made a deal with the devil and he blew his reputation. But she called Bernie voters basement dwellers.\nSo all of the Bernie votes out there, join our movement, like all of these young people. We're going to fix our trade deals and get special interests out of government.\nAnd by the way, by the time this ends, I'll have over a hundred million dollars of my money in this thing, right, which means that's $100 million of people that don't have to give me money and say, Donald, will you do this, will you do that, will you do that? [applause]\nThat's a lot of money. [applause]\nAnd I asked her the other night, I said, you know, I will have over a hundred million and that's a lot of money. If I lose, I'm going to be so angry at Florida. [laughter]\nI'll still love you, I think. Maybe not. [applause]\nYou know, one of the pundits said, and you've heard me say this maybe, but they said, Mr. Trump, it doesn't matter whether you win or lose. You have done the single greatest job. nobody's ever done a thing like this before. No matter where we go it's like this. But... [applause]\nThey said it's the single Bill O'Reilly said it, but many peoples said, it's the single greatest political phenomena they've ever seen. I said, wait a minute, you're wrong.\nIf I don't win on November 8th, I will consider this the single greatest waste of time, energy and money of anything I've ever done, because we're not going to be able to reduce your taxes, we're not going to be able to save your Second Amendment, appoint Supreme Court judges, take care of you vets, fix up your depleted, very depleted the greatest people on earth but our military is so depleted.\nWe're going to take care of a lot of things, including getting the drugs out. A vote for Hillary is a vote for more reckless foreign invasions. What a mess did she do does she go down as the all-time worst?\nMore Wall Street cheating, more terrible trade deals. And as WikiLeaks showed, she wants to cut your Medicare and Social Security benefits. You didn't see that. [booing]\nSee? And I'm not going to. The press doesn't report that she wants to cut your Social Security. And she wants to cut Medicare and one of the big advantages of me having a rather large microphone, meaning a lot of people are listening, is that I can talk about WikiLeaks and look it's on al the television networks live. We're live. [applause]\nAmazing. [applause]\nI think they are just turning them all off now. Watch. You go home, they'll say, why did it end so abruptly?\nA vote for Trump is a vote for America first and it's a vote to protect Medicare and Social Security and lower your taxes. [applause]\nBig, big tax decrease. We're going to lower your taxes. WikiLeaks also shows something I've been warning about for a very, very long time. The media is simply an extension of the Clinton Campaign. [booing]\nIt's one of the biggest ways that our system is rigged. And I was the first one to use that term when I was running in the primaries when I won Louisiana and I got fewer delegates than people that I beat easily.\nAnd my people said, oh no, that's the way the system I say, well then the system's wrong! How do you win a state and you get less delegates?\nAnd I said, this system is rigged! And it was, but we figured out how to win, right? That's what you need. [applause]\nWon in a landslide. I got more votes than anybody in the history of the Republican Party in the primaries system [applause]\nBy far. Wasn't even close. [applause]\nReporters who work for these outlets like the Washington Post or the New York Times may think of themselves as journalists, but they're actually cogs for a corrupt political machine. That's the Clinton machine. The e-mail show the New York Times, the Boston Globe, Univision who I sued I sued Univision, and I was very happy with what they did. [booing]\nAnd this lightweight, you know John Hardwood, this lightweight. This guy who came out, he was shaking. He was so nervous.\nHe asked me the first question, \"Mr. Trump, could you answer this question?\" What a lightweight. They shoulda fired him for what he did.\nJohn Harwood. I hate to make him famous but 'cause nobody ever heard of him before, but a total lightweight of CNBC all doing favors for the Clintons.\nAnd reporters smothering the Clintons with praise. The New York Times even gave Clinton a call to give her a veto power over her quotes in a story that was already written. Nobody ever called me and said, \"Hi, Mr. Trump. We wrote a story. Would you read the story and please give us a little feedback. Would you like us to take anything out?\"\nThis system is so rigged. Now, this is all down in the e-mails. She had veto power over what she said.\nI'll tell you what. I want to have that, too. I want to have veto power.\nI used to get such good publicity, folks. Now, I mean it's like it's incredible. I used to get my life was so simple.\nMy life was so simple. I had a beautiful, simple life. It was going.\nI built an unbelievable company. And then I decide to do this, and my life became slightly more complex.\nYou know, we have people in this audience right now that 18 years ago had one great job, they were making more money 18 years ago than they're making now. And now they have two and sometimes three jobs. In other words, they're older and they're working harder, and they're making less.\nNot a good not a good assemblage of facts. Here's the only good news. I'm also older and working harder than I've ever worked before.\nOK? That I can tell you. [applause]\nIncluding being in this wonderful area at 114 degrees temperature. [applause]\nWhich is great 'cause you go home and you lose weight. I mean why you can't be. You go home, you say, \"I feel great. I lost a lot of weight.\"\nBy the way, let Hillary Clinton stand up here for an hour and talk the way I talk, and let's see how long she lasts folks. [applause]\nOh, what a joke what a total joke. Our country's in such trouble. That's why I'm I it's just so ridiculous.\nThe corporate media can't report on the establishment because the corporate media is the establishment, such a big part of it. We're going to break up the special interest monopoly, and we're going to win this country back for the American people. We're gonna do it, too. [applause]\nThe e-mails also reveal that Hillary Clinton believes in global governments, unlimited immigration unlimited, much more than Obama. From the Middle East, come right in. Come right in.\n550 percent more than President Obama, who is grossly incompetent. He doesn't know what the hell he's doing. [applause]\nAnd why is he campaigning? We just had a horrible jobs report. We have no growth. You saw GDP at one percent we have no growth. We have a horrible jobs report. China is ripping us off. Japan is ripping us off with the cars. Mexico has a unbelievable deal with us, both on the border I mean, look at our trade deficit with Mexico. And China, and Vietnam, and everybody.\nLast year, our country had a trade deficit of almost $800 billion. $800 billion. [booing]\nWho the hell negotiates these deals? I mean, can you believe it? So I say, why the hell is Obama allowed to campaign for Hillary Clinton? He's always campaigning, and he's doing his little thing, you know, having a good time. He ought to be out in the White House. He's not there long. He ought to be there working and fixing some of these horrible trade deals and bringing jobs back to our country, not campaigning for a crooked person, for a totally dishonest and crooked person. [applause]\nSpeaking in secret to a foreign bank, Hillary Clinton said, my dream is a hemispheric common market that's not good for your jobs with totally open trade and open borders. 600 million people could pour into the United States. You'll have nothing left.\nTell you, if that happens, I know the real estate here, I love the real estate here sell fast. Behind closed doors, when she thought no one was listening, she pledged to dissolve the borders of the United States of America. This all came out. She said she wants to dissolve the borders. And here I am saying, we want strong borders. We don't want drugs coming in. We don't want crime coming in. I don't know, maybe I'm wasting my time. Am I wasting my time? I don't think so. [applause]\nShe doesn't want to have any borders. Total amnesty tell you what, folks. This is the last time you'll ever have a chance to save our country. It's not going to happen. You won't be able to. The numbers will be too great. Already, the Republican nominee has a massive disadvantage, and especially when you have the leaders not putting their weight behind the people. They're not putting their weight behind the people[booing]\nInstead of calling me and saying, congratulations, you did a great job. You absolutely destroyed her in the debate, like everybody said you know, Pat Buchanan wrote the big article today, you saw it—I'm not bragging, I'm just saying—maybe a little bit, but here—he said it was the single greatest debate performance in the history of presidential politics. [applause]\nSo wouldn't you think that Paul Ryan would call and say, good going? In front of just about the largest audience for a second night debate in the history of the country. So you know, you'd think that they'd say, great going, Don. Let's go, let's beat this crook. She's a crook. Let's beat her. We got to stop it. No, he doesn't do that.\nThere's a whole deal going on there. I mean, you know, there's a whole deal going on and we're going to figure it out. I always figure things out. But there's a whole sinister deal going on.\nCrooked Hillary wants to end forever the American independence that our founders gave us. Our great founders are spinning in their graves. Our founders are spinning in their graves like Douglas MacArthur, like George Patton, like our generals. They're spinning in their grave and by the way, General Flynn and all the generals - over 200 admirals and generals have endorsed Donald Trump.\nTwo hundred. Over 200. [applause]\nTwenty-one congressional Medal of Honor recipients have endorsed Donald Trump. I'll tell you, you know what I like? Very smart, tough people like me. I like that. The smart, tough people, they like Trump.\nAmerican soldiers have fought and died to win and keep America's freedom and now Hillary Clinton wants to surrender that freedom to open borders, open trade, and world government. And I do believe in free trade but I believe more in smart trade.\nWe're going to make great deals with other countries. We're going to bring jobs back. We're going to bring jobs back. [applause]\nI'm not running to be president of the world. I'm running to be president of the United States of America. [applause]\nOh, I wish those cameras would turn so some time our friends back in New York and back in Pennsylvania and back in Ohio and all these different states, they could see the crowds but they do hear it. You know, when you hear the noise, they say they never show the crowd but you hear the crowd. You can't imitate that noise. [applause]\nWe will never surrender the freedom and sovereignty of the United States. It's going to be America first, America first, America first. [applause]\nAnd yesterday, Hillary had Al Gore - climate change. Now, I want - just so you know - do you know that I've won numerous environmental awards? I'm a believer in the environment. It's got to be within reason. I'm a believer. Here's what I want, though. I want immaculately clean water and I want immaculately clean air. That's what I want. That's called climate change. That's called environmental protection [applause]\nBut Hillary had this deal. Very, very lightly attended and I watched on television as they said this is the largest crowd that she's had. You know what she's got? Like a tiny little fraction. Now, they're not going to say look at the crowd with crooked Hillary yesterday. She had Al Gore get up, this poor guy. [booing]\nI don't know what the hell happened to him. What happened to him? She had Al Gore get up, because don't forget, Obama thinks that climate change is the single biggest and most dangerous problem for the world today. [booing]\nNot nuclear weapons in the hands of maniacs or in the hands of countries that hate us. No, no that's no problem. Climate change is our problem. I'll tell you how this going, how we're doing folks. If we don't win this election, I don't know what I'm going to do. [applause]\nI don't know. No, no can you imagine? Here's a guy where we have ISIS that he essentially founded, if you look. Remember I said, founded and he's going to get the medal for having—and I kiddingly. But it's really not that kiddingly but then they put it on Mo Bisely, he found and I says, let me tell you something. When they pulled out of Iraq the way they—we should have never been in Iraq and I was against it and they know it.\nBut we should have never been in Iraq. But when we were, the way he pulled out, he announced when he's leaving, he pulled out everybody instead of leaving, groups behind. And they created a vacuum and ISIS was formed. Now think of this because the biggest thing that came out of the debate in my opinion, and it really came out of the first debate, which if I didn't have fixed microphone or a broken microphone, nobody's been able to tell me, but I watched.\nCouldn't talk very good because my mike didn't work. But I watched and I said you know, it's interesting. Hillary said she's going to do this and this and this but she's been there for 30 years, she never did it. [applause]\nAnd I said to her in the second debate, I said let me ask you a question. Let me—and by the way, you know that so-called Commission on Presidential Debates, the head guy used to work for Bill Clinton. Did you know that? I just found that out. The head guy worked for Bill Clinton. What a rigged deal this is. But here's the story. I have no respect for that group by the way, I have none. It sounds good. Presidential commission, give me a break. [applause]\nThat's why I was so happy what we did to annihilate the enemy the other day. So happy. [applause]\nBecause we're dealing against a very dishonest system. But Hillary, so important, wants to have a radical, and this is very radical, immigration. She wants to radicalize immigration where you have people pouring in. Remember this, the border patrol agents, 16,500 gave me their endorsement. Last week, ICE, ICE, these are great people, you don't hear great things because they're not allowed to do their job.\nThese are people that frankly, would work a lot less. I mean their job's easier if Hillary wins because basically all they have to do is stand there and watch people walk in front of them. ICE, these are great people. Tough people, smart people. First time in their history they endorse me, they've got to work harder, and they endorse me. [applause]\nAnd one of the things they told me that I thought was terrible is that she refused when she was secretary of state to make foreign countries take back their criminal aliens. In other words, we have somebody in from a foreign country illegally. The person kills somebody, hurts somebody, robs a store, robs a bank, does all sorts—sells drugs all over the place, poisons our youth. And we want to send them back to the country from which they came and they bring them back and the country says, we're not taking them.\nBecause they're smart. They don't want them. So they bring them back into the United States and put him into our society. I guarantee you, and you can mark my words, and there's a lot of tape running, that won't happen once when Donald Trump is president; not once, guarantee you that. [applause]\nOne convicted criminal alien, she allowed to go free—totally free; killed a young girl named Casey Chadwick; beautiful young girl. The corrupt establishment in Washington wants to surrender America's borders, even as they send our troops overseas to protect the borders of other countries. She'll protect those borders, but not our borders.\nCasey Chadwick was a great example, and he was let free, and she should be alive today. Jamiel Shaw has a son—had a son, a great young man, killed violently. And I don't know if you know, but killed violently by an illegal immigrant, shot three times in the face for no reason; somebody that wasn't supposed to be here.\nAnd you have—you have case after case after case. We're not going to have it anymore. We're not going to be the stupid people anymore. We're not going to be the stupid, weak people anymore. [applause]\nA Trump administration will secure, control, defend and protect the borders of the United States, as sure as you are standing here today. [applause]\nWe will 100 percent build the wall, 100 percent. [applause]\nAre you ready? Are you ready? [applause]\nAnd who is going to pay for the wall?\nAudience: \"Mexico\"\n100 percent. They just don't know it yet. They don't know it yet, but 100 percent. They'll pay for the wall.\nHey, look, we're going to have a great relationship with Mexico and China and all of these countries that are ripping us off and now have no respect. They're going to make less and they're going to like us more. Funny how that works, but it's true. Mexico is making a fortune with trade. They're taking our jobs. So many things. They are going to respect us finally.\nWe will stop the drugs from pouring into our country. Florida has seen a 470 percent increase in heroin deaths. Think of that—think if you have a child—470 percent increase in heroin deaths since 2007. Think of that. Think of your kids and your grandkids.\nWe're going to stop it. And most of it's coming across the southern border. And let me tell you, when we allow ICE and when we allow the Border Patrol agents and when we give them that big beautiful wall with a door in it so people can come in, but they have to come in legally; we want them to come in, but they have to come in legally. [applause]\nWe will stop the drugs from poisoning our youth and others. [applause]\nBut I have a message for the drug dealers, for the gang members and the criminal cartels: Your days are numbered, believe me; your days are numbered. [applause]\nHillary also wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees. We don't know anything about them. [booing]\nThis, even though she admitted in private according to WikiLeaks, just out, that she knows terrorists are trying to infiltrate—she knows it—they're trying to infiltrate our refugee program. So she said it just yesterday that she knows they're trying to come in through that method, and yet she wants 550 percent more than even Obama's staggeringly high numbers, thousands and thousands.\nWe can't let it happen. And we all have a heart, and we'll build safe havens and we'll have the Gulf States pay because they're not doing their share. Believe me, they're not. They have plenty of money, they'll pay. We can't pay. We owe $20 trillion. 20 trillion, doubled during Obama years. Doubled. He doubled the debt during his years.\nIn fact, the terrorists have already infiltrated our country. There are now 1,000 open ISIS investigations in our 50 states. A record. Attack after attack, including the recent terror strikes in New Jersey, New York, Minnesota, as well as the mall shooting in Washington, were made possible by our extremely open immigration system that's meant only to protect fools, and we're not fools. [booing]\nSo let me state this clearly as I can. I am going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. [applause]\nShe won't even use the word. She won't even use the term. Our incompetent president—I call him our campaign president—our incompetent president won't use the term radical Islamic terrorism. He won't use it. He tries to explain it. He spends hours trying to explain why. If you don't identify your problem, folks, you're never going to get rid of it. It's only getting worse.\nAnd remember, I said it before, we've started off when he became president with no ISIS. Nobody head the term ISIS, which he calls ISIL, right. You know why he does that? Because he likes disturbing all of you. He calls ISIL. But we started off, we had no ISIS. And now, 7 1/2 years later, they're in, they think, 32 countries.\nAnd she's going to get rid of them? I can tell you this. They are hoping and they are praying—they are hoping and praying that Hillary Clinton becomes president of the United States, because they'll take over not only that part of the world. They'll take over this country, they'll take over this part of the world, believe me. They are hoping.\nAnd by the way, she likes to say, they want me—I will be their worst nightmare. I'm going to be their worst nightmare. [applause]\nAnd she lied during the debate. Remember when I said the red line in the sand, right? She said, I wasn't secretary of state then, all flustered, all crazy. She was there when they drew the line. I walked out, they said, you know, she was there. Oh, well, she sort of said she wasn't. She was there.\nIt turned out to be a lie. And even the media said that they hated - she lied about that. She lied about many things.\nShe put Iran on the path to nuclear weapons. You know, this horrible Iran deal where they gave $400 million in cash, but it turned out to be $1.7 billion in cash. You couldn't fit that in the back of this arena, that's how much money it is.\nShe gave - they gave that much money to the terrorists, to our enemies. And by the way, our enemies aren't even nice to us. Now they're emboldened.\nYou see the little boats going around our beautiful ships doing all sorts of little things to drive our people crazy. Folks, they're not gonna do that stuff when I'm president, I guarantee ya. [applause]\nYou see the way they captured our ten sailors 'cause they were a little bit in the wrong waters. And instead of saying nicely, \"Hey, listen. You gotta be over there a little bit\", they humiliated the sailors, humiliated their families, and humiliated our country, right.\nAnd the only reason they let 'em go is that our payments of $150 billion started the next day. So stupid they're not.\nAnd when they fly - they - they flew right alongside of our - our planes the other. You saw that? Their jet fighters.\nRight, you saw that? And when Putin is buzzing - you know Hillary's tough with Russia.\nYou ever notice anything that goes wrong, they blame Russia. Russia did it. They have no idea. We're being hacked because we have people that don't know what they're doing.\nThey have people. But they always blame Russia and then they say, \"Donald Trump is friends with Putin.\"\nI don't know Putin, folks. I promise. I don't know Putin.\nWhat the hell do I have to do with Putin? These people are professional con people. They're con.\nAnd this country can't have it. This country can't have it. And - and by the way, Russia, which is buzzing our ships, right.\nYou know, tough Hillary, tough Obama, they're buzzing. You saw that two weeks ago, buzzing, planes going by. They took over - yeah, they took over.\nYou look at Ukraine. They took over during - that was Crimea. They took that over during Obama's reign.\nYou know, tough Obama. He's so tough. He's so tough.\nSo, look, we need competence and we need it fast. Hillary Clinton who turned Libya into a nightmare.\nHow about Libya? How about Benghazi? How about - how about Benghazi where Ambassador Stevens sent 600 different messages to Hillary Clinton, and she didn't even respond.\nThe only one she spoke to was that sleaze Sidney Blumenthal, her friend who Obama told her you cannot deal with, and she did behind Obama's back. [booing]\nA Trump Administration will stop the reckless interventions, and instead focus on defeating and totally destroying ISIS. We're also going to build up our cyber defenses. Cyber's a big thing.\nAnd keep our power grid and our vital infrastructure modern and safe. And the word \"keep\" is an incorrect word because we have to rebuild it. It's a mess. Show Less Text\nIt's so old, it's falling apart. And we're going to use cyber offense to disrupt the enemy where we need to and keep them from recruiting online.\nISIS is taking our children, and taking our kids out of our country because they're using the internet better than we know how to use it. And we're the ones that came up with it.\nAt the same time, we're going to completely rebuild our very depleted military. We're going to take care of our people. [applause]\nAnd that includes building state-of-the-art systems of all kind. When it comes to keeping America safe, I believe in three very important words: peace through strength. We don't want to use the military. [applause]\nBut it's got to be there. [applause]\nAnd just in closing, to be strong, our country has to be rich again. We're a debtor nation. We're poor. I'm going to make America rich again. [applause]\nMy enemy—our enemies are unbelievable. They love what's happening to our country. They love it. Our energy proposals won't lock the $50 trillion in energy reserves right here in America under our feet.\nThis means new jobs in Florida and many, many other communities. Pennsylvania, Ohio, we're going to take care of our miners, we're going to take care of our steelworkers, we're going to take care of natural gas. We're going to have clean coal. We're going to also have all forms of advanced energy.\nWe also have to repeal and replace it. We will do this and it's so important because it's driving everybody and small businesses and big businesses and our country out of business. Repeal and replace Obamacare. [applause]\nBill Clinton, in a rare moment of truth-telling, said last week Obamacare was a crazy system where people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half. What kind of a system is this?\nOh, did he suffer that evening. He went home aye yai yai, poor Bill. He suffered. You see, the next he came back and he said he was only kidding. He was only kidding. It's a disaster.\nObamacare - you know, your rates are going up 68 percent. In Texas they had 71 percent. In other communities they're going to go 95 percent and 100 percent, and next year is going to be worse. We have no choice but to absolutely repeal, replace Obamacare we're going to come up with a much better plan for much less money. [applause]\nAs you know also, most counties in the state will only have one insurer to choose from. Obama does that because that way they have a monopoly so they can charge you whatever the hell they want.\nThis is our chance to stop the abusive and horrible and—and something that doesn't work, Obamacare, and save American healthcare, but you have to get out and vote.\nAt the center of our economic revival, we'll be fixing our terrible trade deals. When I announced, seems like a long time now, June 16th coming down with Melania at the escalator, remember, in Trump Tower, was an amazing - that was an amazing thing and we announced that it was a big part.\nAnd then I came out and I said Florida and our countries, we have all of these lost jobs. All of our lost manufacturing. We're going to get it back. We're bringing our jobs back.\nWhen countries come in and think they're going to steal our companies and our companies are going to go out and fire all of their employees in Florida, in Ohio, in Pennsylvania, in all of these countries. All of these—everyone. We are not going to allow it to happen. We are not going to allow it.\nWe are going to tell it, you are going to have consequences. The states are not going to put up with it anymore. Our federal government is going to help.\nWe've built other countries at our expense. We have. So, if they come in like they did in Indiana - where Mike Pence, by the way, is doing a great job. [applause]\nAnd they take - in the case, they take - Mexico takes care of your air conditioner, and they fire their 1,400 people who were so great to me.\nAnd they think they're going to make air conditioners in their beautiful new plant in Mexico, and sell them across the border and make lots of money, and we have all the employment. Not going to happen. We're going to put a 35 percent tax on and they're staying in the United States [applause]\nAnd if they don't, we're going to make plenty of money. [applause]\nWe are going to rebuild our country. Our country is going to be a country where you can be proud of again. We're going to use American steel, we're going to use American labor, we are going to come first in all deals.\nWe're not going to make the trade deal where we come in fifth and sixth and seventh and other countries laugh at our stupidity. We are going to build great companies. We are going to expand companies that are now doing poorly. We are going to make our country very rich again.\nWe are going to make our country very safe again. [applause]\nWe are going to make America strong again. And we are going to make America great again. God bless you, everybody. God bless you. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2016-10-12", "title": "Remarks at the Southeastern Livestock Pavilion in Ocala, Florida"}

Make sure you request your absentee ballot to vote by mail. And remind your friends and family to do the same.\nWe are now 26 days away from the most important election of our lifetimes.\nAnd we've only begun to fight.\nIf we win, we will create a booming and thriving economy for young Americans. We will create safe communities, lower taxes, leaner government, affordable childcare and healthcare, and a government that is honest and decent and fair.\nWe are the campaign of change.\nWe will deliver jobs, opportunity and justice for future generations.\nI've wanted this race to be about the issues. But the Clinton Campaign has refused to discuss the issues. They only place they want to go is the gutter.\nSo they have slandered and libeled me with false accusations – but we will not let these lies distract us from our campaign.\nIn an earlier speech today, I addressed the fact that I was falsely accused. It is disgraceful that you can have front page articles in the New York Times inventing false claims, without any evidence, any witnesses, anything at all.\nI want to talk about the policies affecting our lives, and your future.\nRight now, our government has been taken hostage by global special interests that will stop at nothing to drain every last ounce of wealth from this country for their personal benefit.\nThe greatest weapon wielded by the Clinton Machine is the media. The WikiLeaks emails show that the Clinton Machine and the Corporate Media are one in the same – they collaborate and conspire together.\nThis Washington establishment will stop at nothing to stop all of us.\nThese are the people who have given us decades of endless wars producing only death and bloodshed, but no victory.\nThese are the same people who have flung our doors open to Radical Islam, putting us on the same path to France of multigenerational struggles with violence and extremism embedded in our communities.\nThese are the people who've allowed violent international cartels to invade our country and prey on our most vulnerable citizens. Victims like Marilyn Pharis, raped by an illegal immigrant with a lengthy criminal record and beaten to death with a hammer.\nThese are the people who've let drugs pour into our country and poising our children.\nThese are the people who emptied the jobs out of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and North Carolina and shipped them to other countries.\nThe political powers trying to stop us are the people who've stripped the jobs form our inner cities, trapped millions of African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans in impoverished, crime-besieged neighborhoods, and left 70 million American women and child in poverty or near the brink of poverty.\nAt the center of this assault on American prosperity is the Clinton Machine. They don't work for you, they don't work for America, the work only for themselves and their donors – including foreign government and foreign actors.\nHillary Clinton is a criminal who destroyed 33,000 emails after a Congressional Subpoena.\nShe ignored hundreds of requests for security in Benghazi, causing the deaths of four brave Americans – and then she lied to the faces of the grieving parents about the reason for the attack.\nShe defended a man who violently and viciously raped a 12 year-old girl by horribly smearing and blaming the victim – and the she laughed about getting the rapist off the hook.\nSpeaking in secret to a foreign bank, Hillary pledged her support for \"open borders.\" That means tens of millions of new foreign workers to compete against you for your jobs, your wages, your futures – she's selling out the future of young American, of all backgrounds, to enrich her donors.\nWe won't let it happen.\nHillary and her special interest allies want to keep children in our inner cities trapped in failing schools.\nUnder a Trump Administration, disadvantaged children will be able to attend the public, private, charter or magnet school of their choice.\nUnder President Obama and Hillary Clinton, the national debt has almost doubled.\n$20 trillion-dollar national debt is a weight around the future of every young person in this country. It would require $120,000 from every millennial in the country to pay off.\nThe new debt added under Obama and Clinton would have been enough to pay off all the outstanding student loans in the United States 6 times over.\nYet, not one penny of that new debt has gone to lowering your tuition.\nThe share of 16-to-28-year-olds not in the labor force has increased to 45 percent during the Obama administration.\nIn a Trump Administration, we will work every day to make America great again for millennials.\nFirst, we will Lower the Cost of College and Solve the Student Loan Crisis.\nTuition at public four-year institutions was 40% higher in the last school year than it was ten years ago.\nIn all, Americans owe $1.3 trillion on their student loans--more than auto loans, credit card debt, or home equity loans nationwide.\nStudents should not be asked to pay more on their loans than they can afford, and the debt should not be an albatross around their necks for the rest of their lives.\nThat is why under my student loan program, we would cap repayment to an affordable portion of a borrower's income--12.5%. And if borrowers work hard and make their full payments for 15 years, we will let them get on with their lives.\nThat's the nature of the deal we give many public employees today.\nEvery American deserves the same deal, so we will equalize treatment so everyone can start saving for their families and retirement by the time they are 15 years out of college.\nIn addition, I will take steps to push colleges to cut the skyrocketing cost of tuition. If the federal government is going to subsidize student loans, it has a right to expect that colleges work hard to control costs and invest their resources in their students.\nIf colleges refuse to take this responsibility seriously, they will be held accountable--including by reconsidering whether those with huge endowments deserve to keep those endowments tax-exempt.\nSome schools are paying more to hedge funds and private equity managers than they are spending on tuition assistance--while taxpayers are guaranteeing hundreds of billions of dollars of student loans to pay for rising tuition.\nWe want universities to spend their endowments on their students, not themselves. They need to use that money to cut the college debt and college tuition.\nMuch of the skyrocketing cost of college education is due to the tremendous bloat in college administrators and bureaucrats. According to the Department of Education, the number of college administrators is up more than 60 percent since 1993--ten times the increase in tenured faculty positions.\nFederal regulations are responsible for much of this administrative bloat. Vanderbilt University estimated that it spends $150 million per year---11 percent of the university's budget--to comply with government regulations.\nAs president, I will immediately take steps to drive down college costs by reducing the unnecessary costs of compliance with federal regulations so that colleges can pass on the savings to students in the form of lower tuition.\nI will also make it a priority to protect students' rights to free speech on campus. In the past few decades, political correctness has transformed our institutions of higher education from ones that fostered spirited debate, to a place of extreme censorship where students are silenced.\nWe will end the political correctness, and foster free and respectful dialogue.\nWe also have to recognize that traditional four-year degree programs are not the only path to a good job and a good career. We should support schools that allow people to learn skills and practice a trade so young people can have access to the education that's right for them. And we must hold all schools equally accountable for their performance.\nI will make sure that students have the information they need about all of their options before starting school, and for repaying their student loans upon leaving school.\nThere is a lot of room for improvement in this regard. Currently, students navigate 16 complex repayment plans, 8 forgiveness programs, and 32 deferment and forbearance options—each of these programs has their own nuances and qualifications. I will simplify this confusing maze into a single Income-Based Repayment Program, similar to those that have proved so popular in recent years.\nWe also have to make sure that those who have graduated college and those who are soon to graduate can find a good job to start a good career when they do.\nMany mothers across this country are worried their kids won't find jobs, and they are right to be worried. One of the biggest threats is outsourcing – jobs for college-educated kids are being sent to other countries. At the same time, companies are importing low-wage workers on H-1B visas to take jobs from young college-trained Americans.\nWe will protect these jobs for Americans.\nMy economic plan – including tax, trade regulatory, and energy reforms – will create 25 million new jobs and allow the private sector to grow at 4 percent per year.\nThis includes reforms to protect and expand the sharing economy--startups like Uber--that have managed to provide great services to consumers, and create lots of jobs in the process.\nFinally, and most importantly, the foundation for a new prosperity will be a rededication to the constitutional rule of law.\nA vote for me is a vote for change, and a vote for me is really a vote for you.\nTogether, we are going to make America great again.", "timestamp": "2016-10-13", "title": "Remarks at the Renaissance Hotel in Columbus, Ohio"}

As an example, just one single trade deal they'd like to pass, involves trillions of dollars controlled by many countries, corporations and lobbyists.\nFor those who control the levers of power in Washington, and for the global special interests they partner with, our campaign represents an existential threat.\nThis is not simply another 4-year election. This is a crossroads in the history of our civilization that will determine whether or not We The People reclaim control over our government.\nThe political establishment that is trying everything to stop us, is the same group responsible for our disastrous trade deals, massive illegal immigration, and economic and foreign policies that have bled this country dry. The political establishment has brought about the destruction of our factories and our jobs, as they flee to Mexico, China and other countries throughout the world. Our just-announced jobs numbers are anemic, and our gross domestic product, or GDP, is barely above one percent. Workers in the United States, were making less than they were almost 20 years ago – and yet they are working harder.\nIt's a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth, and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities.\nJust look at what this corrupt establishment has done to our cities like Detroit and Flint, Michigan – and rural towns in Pennsylvania, Ohio, North Carolina and across our country. They have stripped these towns bare, and raided the wealth for themselves and taken away their jobs.\nThe Clinton Machine is at the center of this power structure. We've seen this firsthand in the WikiLeaks documents in which Hillary Clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers.\nAnd, likewise, the emails show that the Clinton Machine is so closely and irrevocably tied to media organizations that she is given the questions and answers in advance of her debates. Clinton is also given approval and veto power over quotes written about her in the New York Times. And the emails show the reporters collaborate and conspire directly with the Clinton Campaign on helping her win the election.\nWith their control over our government at stake, with trillions of dollars on the line, the Clinton Machine is determined to achieve the destruction of our campaign, which has now become a movement the likes of which our country has never seen before – and we won't let them do that.\nThe most powerful weapon deployed by the Clintons is the corporate media. Let's be clear on one thing: the corporate media in our country is no longer involved in journalism. They are a political special interest, no different than any lobbyist or other financial entity with an agenda. And their agenda is to elect the Clintons at any cost, at any price, no matter how many lives they destroy.\nFor them, it is a war – and for them, nothing is out of bounds.\nThis is a struggle for the survival of our nation. This election will determine whether we are a free nation, or whether we have only the illusion of Democracy but are in fact controlled by a small handful of global special interests rigging the system.\nThis is not just conspiracy but reality, and you and I know it.\nThe establishment and their media enablers wield control over this nation through means that are well known. Anyone who challenges their control is deemed a sexist, a racist, a xenophobe and morally deformed. They will attack you, they will slander you, they will seek to destroy your career and reputation. And they will lie, lie and lie even more.\nThe Clintons are criminals. This is well-documented, and the establishment that protects them has engaged in a massive cover-up of widespread criminal activity at the State Department and Clinton Foundation in order to keep the Clintons in power. Never in history have we seen such a cover-up as this, one that includes the destruction of 33,000 emails, 13 phones, laptops, missing boxes of evidence, and on and on.\nPeople who are capable of such crimes against our nation are capable of anything.\nAnd so now we address the slander and libels that was just last night thrown at me by the Clinton Machine, the New York Times, and other media outlets, as part of a concerted, coordinated and vicious attack.\nIt is not coincidence that these attacks come at the exact same moment, and all together at the same time, as the WikiLeaks documents expose the massive international corruption of the Clinton Machine – including 2,000 more emails this morning\nThese claims about me of inappropriate conduct with women are totally and absolutely false – and the Clinton Machine knows it is. It's all fabricated. It's pure fiction and outright lies. These events never happened. The claims are preposterous, ludicrous and defy truth, common sense and logic.\nWe already have substantial evidence to dispute these lies, and it will be made public in the appropriate way and at the appropriate time. These lies come from outlets whose past stories, and past claims, have already been discredited. The media outlets did not even attempt to confirm the most basic facts, because even a simple investigation would have shown these are false smears.\nWhat's happening to me is no different than what happened to other innocent people, like the story written in Rolling Stone Magazine – and that magazine should be put out of business.\nSix months ago, the New York Times wrote a massive story attacking me, and the central witness they used said the story was false, that she was quoted inaccurately. She said I was a great guy, and never made those remarks.\nWe demanded a retraction, but they refused to print it – just like they refused to print the comments from another source who praised me in her book, or the words of another wonderful woman who said nice things.\nThat story was a fraud and an embarrassment to the New York Times. It will be part of the lawsuit we are preparing against them. Now today, the same two discredited writers, who should have been fired from the times, tell a totally fabricated and false story that supposedly took place on an airplane more than 30 years ago – another ridiculous tale, no witnesses, no nothing.\nAlso, a writer from people magazine who wrote a story on Melania and myself on our first anniversary. The story was lovely but last night we hear, after 12 years, a new claim that I made inappropriate advances. I ask a very simple question, why wasn't it part of the story that appeared 12 years ago? I was one of the biggest stars on television, and it would have been one of the biggest stories of the year. Take a look at her words. It would have been the headline. No, it only appears 26 days before the election.\nThis invented account has already been debunked by eyewitness testimony – the very witness identified by the author has said the story is entirely false.\nThis weekend, the New York Times published a full-page hit piece with another claim from an individual who has been totally discredited based on the emails and letters she has sent to our office over the years. But the New York Times refused to use the evidence we presented them. Others have likewise were presented with this story, but after seeing the evidence we provided, refused to print it.\nThis is part of a concerted effort, led by the New York Times, which is fighting desperately for its relevance and survival, and which probably won't even be around in a few years based on its financial outlook, has become more and more vicious and vile.\nI will not allow the Clinton Machine to turn this campaign into a discussion of their slanders and lies, but will remain focused on the issues facing the American people.\nBut let me state this as clearly as I can. These attacks are orchestrated by the Clintons and their media allies. They are false and slanderous in every respect. We are now less than a month from the most important election of our lifetime – indeed one the most important elections in modern history – and the polls show us in a dead heat. And the new Rasmussen poll shows us 2 points ahead.\nSo now, the Clinton Machine, has put forward a small handful of people out of the tens of thousands I have met, worked with and employed – in order to make wild and false allegations that fail to meet even the most basic test of common sense. Again, this is nothing more than an attempt to destroy our movement and for the Clintons to keep their corrupt control over this government.\nWhen I declared my candidacy, I knew what bad shape our country was in. I had seen firsthand the corruption and the sickness that has taken over our politics. I knew they would throw every lie they could at me, and my family, and my loved ones.\nI knew they would stop at nothing to try to stop me.\nBut I take all of these slings and arrows for you. I take them for our movement, so that we can have our country back.\nOur great civilization, here in America and across the civilized world, has come upon a moment of reckoning.\nWe've seen it in the United Kingdom, where they voted to liberate themselves from global government and global trade deals and global immigration deals that have destroyed their sovereignty.\nBut the central base of world political power is here in America, and it is our corrupt political establishment that is the greatest power behind the efforts at radical globalization and the disenfranchisement of working people.\nTheir financial resources are unlimited. Their political resources are unlimited. Their media resources are unlimited. And, most importantly, the depths of their immorality is unlimited.\nOur political establishment has no soul.\nI knew these false attacks would come. I knew this day would arrive. And I knew the American people would rise above it and vote for the future they deserve.\nThe only thing that can stop the Corrupt Clinton Machine is you. The only force strong enough to save this country is you. The only people brave enough to vote out this corrupt establishment is you, the American People.\nThey control the Department of Justice, and they even clandestinely meet with the Attorney General of the United States – in the back of her airplane, while on the runway – for 39 minutes – to most likely discuss her reappointment in a Clinton Administration just prior to the Attorney General making a decision over whether or not to prosecute Hillary Clinton.\nLikewise, they have corrupted the Director of the FBI to the point at which stories are already saying the great men and women who work for the FBI are embarrassed and ashamed to what he's done to one of our great institutions. Hillary Clinton is guilty of all of the things that Director Comey stated at his press conference and Congressional hearings, and far more – and yet he let her off the hook, while others lives are being destroyed for far less.\nThis is a conspiracy against you, the American people.\nThis is our moment of reckoning as a society and as a civilization.\nI didn't need to do this. I built a great company, and I had a wonderful life. I could have enjoyed the benefits of years of successful business for myself and my family, instead of going through this absolute horror show of lies, deceptions and malicious attacks. I'm doing it because this country has given me so much, and I feel strongly it was my turn to give back.\nSome people warned me this campaign would be a journey to hell. But they are wrong, it will be a journey to heaven because we will help so many people.\nIn my former life, I was an insider as much as anybody else – and I know what's like to be an insider. Now I am being punished for leaving their special club and revealing to you their great scam. Because I used to be part of the club, I'm the only one who can fix it. I'm doing this for the people, and this movement is just right – and we will take back this country for you and Make America Great Again.\nThe corrupt establishment knows that we are an existential threat to their criminal enterprise. They know, that if we win, their power is gone and returned to you. The clouds hanging over our government can be lifted, and replaced with a bright future – but it all depends on whether we let the New York Times decide our future, or whether we let the American people decide our future.\nIf this Clinton Campaign of Destruction is allowed to work, then no other highly successful person – which is what our country needs – will ever again run for this office.\nI will not lie to you. These false attacks hurt. To be lied about, to be slandered, to be smeared so publicly and before your family, is painful.\nWhat the Clinton Machine is doing to me, and my family, is egregious beyond words. It is reprehensible beyond description.\nBut I also know, it's not about me – it's about all of you. It's about all of us, together, as a country.\nIt's about the Veterans who need medical care, the mothers who've lost children to terrorism and crime, it's about the inner cities and the border towns who desperately need our help, it's about the millions of jobless Americans. This election is about the people being crushed by Obamacare, and it's about defeating ISIS and appointing Supreme Court Justices who will defend our Constitution.\nThis election is also about the African-American and Hispanic communities whose communities have been plunged into crime, poverty and failing schools by the policies of Hillary Clinton. They've robbed these citizens of their future, and I will give them their hope, jobs and opportunities back. I will deliver.\nThis election is about every man, woman and child in our country who deserves to live in safety, prosperity and peace.\nWe will rise above the lies, the smears, and the ludicrous slanders from ludicrous reporters.\nWe will vote for the country we want.\nWe will vote for the future we want.\nWe will vote for the politics we want.\nWe will vote to put this corrupt government cartel out of business. We will remove from our politics the special interests who have betrayed our workers, our borders, our freedoms, and our sovereign rights as a nation. We will end the politics of profit, we will end the rule of special interests, we will put a stop to the raiding of our country – and the disenfranchisement of our people.\nOur Independence Day is at hand, and it arrives, finally, on November 8th. Join me in taking back our country, and creating a bright and glorious new dawn for our people.", "timestamp": "2016-10-13", "title": "Remarks at the South Florida Fair Expo Center in West Palm Beach, Florida"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119569", "text": "Aboard Air Force One\nEn Route Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\n12:46 P.M. EDT\nMR. SCHULTZ: Good afternoon. Welcome aboard Air Force One as we head to the White House Frontiers Conference in Pittsburgh, a city that has harnessed innovation to redefine itself as a center for technology, health care and education. From the beginning of this administration, the President has been committed to science and innovation, making the largest single investment in basic research in our history, recruiting tech talent to work in the federal government, launching 21st century moonshots for cancer, brain research, and solar energy, expanding broadband, and unleashing the potential of precision medicine.\nBut today's conference is not about the progress we've already made. The President convened the White House Frontiers Conference to focus on the work that remains, to gather some of the world's leading innovators to discuss how investing in science and technology frontiers can help improve people's lives.\nPrior to his remarks and the panel discussion on future health breakthroughs, the President will get a look at how these innovators work, from an actual spacecraft to a groundbreaking prosthetic arm -- is doing just that.\nWith that, I'm happy to take your questions.\nQ: Can we perhaps start with what happened in Yemen yesterday? Can you tell us a little bit about whether and where the President took the decision -- whether he took the decision to launch retaliatory strikes, or whether it was a standing order in the field; whether there will be more strikes like that if the vessels are fired upon again?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Thank you, Andrew. As the Department of Defense announced last night, U.S. military -- the United States military struck three radar sites in Houthi-controlled territory on Yemen's Red Sea coast. These strikes were recommended by the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Dunford, but they were indeed authorized by the President. These were ordered in response to the missile launches threatening the USS Mason, which is operating in international waters.\nThese limited self-defense strikes were conducted to protect our personnel, our ships and our freedom of navigation in this important maritime passageway.\nQ: But has he given them an order to -- has the President given them an order to, say, they can continue to fire back if fired upon, or is rather something that would go back to him for another decision?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Yesterday's self-defense strikes specifically targeted radar sites involved in the recent missile launches in the vicinity of the USS Mason and other vessels in international waters. The intent of our strikes were to deter future attacks and to reduce the risk to U.S. and other vessels. And we are prepared to respond if necessary to any future missile launches.\nQ: Eric, people are looking at this as an escalation of the U.S. military involvement in Yemen's war. We've tried to kind of stay out of it, and we haven't struck the Houthis directly before. So is it fair to say the U.S. is stepping up its military role, or is this purely going to be defensive measures if and when there are strikes launched at the U.S.?\nMR. SCHULTZ: If they're looking at the situation in that regard, they would be looking at it incorrectly. This is purely a self-defense action designed to deter future missile strikes against U.S. assets in the area. We absolutely believe that the situation in Yemen is one that should be resolved, and that we'd like to see a de-escalation of the violence.\nThere was actually an accord signed on April 10th with all the parties involved, and our belief is that the violence should subside consistent with the terms in that agreement.\nQ: And, Eric --\nMR. SCHULTZ: This is -- let me just be crystal-clear. So this is not any engagement in the sectarian situation on the ground in Yemen. This is purely a self-defense measure taken in response to the missile launches threatening the USS Mason.\nQ: The White House has talked a lot in the past about Iranian support for the Houthis and armed shipments to them. At this point, does the U.S. have any reason to believe that the missiles that were launched at the U.S. asset was not provided by Iran? And do you have any response to the Iranian navy ships that are now heading with a beeline to the region?\nMR. SCHULTZ: So, Josh, we saw those reports. I'm not going to speculate on the intent of the Iranians. I will say that what we have said is Houthis in Yemen are being supported by the Iranians. So we know that for sure. But I'm not going to be able to dig any deeper on our analysis there. I can tell you that our bottom line for the area is that we call on everyone involved to deescalate the violence. There was an important agreement reached on April 10th; this included the Saudis, the Yemeni government, the Houthis, and others. And we call on all parties involved to abide by that agreement.\nQ: Any update on the U.S. review of support for the Saudi-led coalition?\nMR. SCHULTZ: As you know, that was announced over the weekend in response to a strike by the Saudi-led coalition of a funeral home. I don't have any updates on that. But obviously, the President believes that when we support any mission like the Saudi-led coalition, it's not a blank check; that we expect that actions carried out, consistent with American values. And that's what prompted the review.\nQ: Eric, do you think that the heightened tensions in Yemen could distract the U.S. from its mission against ISIS?\nMR. SCHULTZ: No, Kevin. We believe that the sectarian violence in Yemen should be resolved through political means. And that's why there was an agreement reached in the middle of April, and we call on all parties to follow through with the commitments made in the April 10th agreement.\nIn terms of the President's focus on ISIL, that's been relentless. You've seen us have success in rolling back ISIL-controlled territory all around the globe. You've also seen us have success taking out their leadership one by one. You've seen us have success constricting their ability to attract finances. So our focus on that remains unabated.\nQ: Eric, Nigeria has announced that some of the girls that were kidnapped by Boko Haram have been released. Does the White House have any expectation of more girls being released? And has the U.S. been involved in that?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Jeff, I did get briefed on that earlier before our flight, and I can tell you that the United States does welcome the news that a number of Chibok girls -- school girls -- have been released to the Nigerian government. We're working with our partners in the Nigerian government to gather the details on the release of these girls. But we continue to call for the unconditional release of all those being held by Boko Haram, now known as ISIL's West Africa Province. We also continue to provide intelligence, advice and assistance to Nigeria and its regional partners in the fight against the group.\nQ: There's been a new Secretary General at the United Nations chosen. What's the White House reaction to that choice?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Jeff, if it hasn't come out already, a statement by the President will be released shortly, and that statement will reflect President's congratulations to Antonio Guterres as the next Secretary General of the United Nations.\nAs a founding member and host country of the United Nations, and a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, the United States pledges to provide our full support to Mr. Guterres when he assumes the leadership of the United Nations next January. We believe that as the former prime minister of Portugal and U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr. Guterres has the character, vision and skills needed to lead the United Nations at this critical moment, and manage reform in its organizations and operations to better meet the unprecedented challenges facing the international community right now.\nQ: And just one more on a completely different topic. Does the White House have any reaction to the latest reports of sexual misconduct by the Republican nominee Donald Trump?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Jeff, I don't have a specific reaction for you on all of the reports of sexual assault allegedly perpetrated by the Republican nominee for President.\nI will say the President has long said that Donald Trump is not qualified to be President of the United States. That's not just because of his misguided and unwise policies, but it's because of his temperament, his character, and his judgment. That has not just become evident over the last 24 hours, but it's become evident in a long series of views and statements that we've seen from Donald Trump. And the President's belief that Donald Trump should not be President is a view that will likely be reflected in tonight's remarks.\nI expect the President to make a strong, affirmative case, not only for Ohio Senate candidate Ted Strickland, but also for our party's nominee for President of the United States. But he's also not been shy about discussing why he believes Donald Trump is unfit to serve as President of the United States.\nQ: Has he read the latest reports?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I don't know if he's read individual reports or not.\nQ: Donald Trump has said in the past that if the President comes at him politically, that he will come at the President and he'll attack the President. Obviously, the President hasn't been shy about saying what he's had to say about Donald Trump. Is he concerned about anything that Donald Trump might say about himself or about the First Lady, given the attacks that are politically being made by both of them today and ongoing?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Isaac, your question seems to suggest that Donald Trump hasn't been attacking the President.\nQ: Well, I mean, in the last -- beyond the birtherism stuff, which -- and I'm not discounting that. But more specific attacks, laying into the President as a -- his theme for the last week has been Bill Clinton -- that the President would emerge as that kind of thing. Or do you feel there's nothing more that he can say about the President?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Look, the President is going to be out there making the affirmative case for why Secretary Clinton is uniquely qualified to be the next President of the United States. The President believes this for two reasons.\nOne, he saw firsthand her tenacity, her relentlessness, and her focus and drive on behalf of the American people as Secretary of State in his administration.\nTwo, he has actually served as President of the United States. He sat in the Oval Office at the President's desk making decisions day in and day out for the past eight years. So he knows what it takes to be President of the United States. He believes she is best suited to take over the responsibilities next January, but he also believes that she's running against someone who is unfit for office. And the President is going to make that case no matter what threats are thrown at him by the Republican nominee.\nQ: Trump brought up the First Lady at the debate on Sunday. She's campaigning, I think right now, against Donald Trump. Is the President at all concerned about things that Donald Trump might say about her?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I think the only reference to the First Lady that Donald Trump made was thoroughly debunked by every fact-checker who looked at it. And I think --\nQ: -- personal attacks on the First Lady?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I can't think of a bolder way for Donald Trump to lose even more standing than he already has by engaging the First Lady of the United States.\nQ: Eric, let's go to Thailand. Did you have something else on the campaign?\nQ: Is it fair to say that, in terms of the energy the President is devoting to campaigning for Hillary, it's to make sure that his agenda and much of his legacy is not dismantled?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, Todd, the President has talked about this, and I suspect he will in tonight's remarks. He believes that the progress we've made over the past eight years is significant, is substantial. Again, we have the longest stretch of private sector job growth in our nation's history. We have a historic climate agreement with about 90 other nations to reduce carbon pollution around the world. We have the lowest increase in health care costs in decades. Twenty million now have health care under the Affordable Care Act. We've had a relentless campaign against terrorist organizations who wish to do us harm.\nThe President does believe that there's a lot at stake in this election. And the contrast could not be clearer. And we have one nominee who, as the President has said, doesn't have much of an agenda other than to reverse the progress that's been made over the past eight years.\nQ: A question on Thailand. As you know, the Thai King died yesterday. First of all, does the President have plans to go to the funeral? And secondly, the Crown Prince has indicated that he doesn't want to be -- succeed to the throne just yet. Are you concerned that a disorderly transfer of power in Thailand might further destabilize the country, which has suffered two coups in the last, what, 15 years?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Andrew, I hadn't seen those reports before we boarded. I could say, generally speaking, as I think was reflected in the President's statement earlier today, that we do offer our heartfelt condolences to the people of Thailand.\nThe King was a close friend to the United States. The President had an opportunity to visit with him in 2012 on the President's visit. The President recalls the King's warmth and grace at the time. As the President said in his statement today, the King was a tireless advocate for his country's development. He exuded a creative spirit. He was a driver of innovation and an inspiring force for improving the quality of life for the people of Thailand. He will be missed, and the American people share with the people of Thailand in this period of mourning.\nI don't believe that they have released any details about a service yet. So once they do, then we'll be in a better position to respond with our plans.\nQ: Eric, there's a report that the President and the administration are going to be holding a meeting to discuss options for military action in Syria on Friday. Can you confirm that?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Toluse, I don't have any internal meetings to preview at this time. I can tell you that Secretary Kerry is traveling to Switzerland later this week -- I think over the weekend, actually -- to meet with a number of countries to discuss a multilateral approach to resolving the crisis in Syria.\nThis is obviously consistent with the President's view that the situation in Syria can only be resolved diplomatically. And while this war continues in earnest, the United States continues to lead the world in humanitarian assistance for Syria as the single largest donor to the humanitarian crisis there.\nThis now includes up to -- well, this now includes $5.9 billion worth of humanitarian assistance. That includes things like food and shelter, water, medical care in urgent relief to help address the crisis there.\nAs you know, the President doesn't believe there's a military solution to the crisis in Syria, that this will only be solved diplomatically. But this hasn't deterred us from our campaign against ISIL. Again, this is a place -- even in Syria -- where we don't have a centralized government to work in. We've been able to roll back territory controlled by ISIL, about 25 percent of their territory that they've previously held. We've also been able to take out ISIL leadership there, most recently Adnani.\nQ: Eric, could you tell us a little bit about why Ohio and why Ted Strickland? This is a Senate race that's not looking real hopeful for Democrats. So what's the impetus for this trip?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I think there's probably a lot of Democrats in Ohio who would have a different analysis for you, Josh. But look, the President's view is he's not only President of the United States, he's also head of the Democratic Party. And like I was saying to Todd earlier, there's a lot at stake in this race in 2016. That's why he's working so hard to elect Secretary Clinton president.\nBut he also believes that there is a lot at stake in the down-ballot races. That's why he's been working hard to elect Democrats to the House of Representatives and to the United States Senate. Ted Strickland is obviously someone the President knows well. He's been a tireless advocate for the working people of Ohio. He believes that we grow -- he shares the President's beliefs that we grow the middle class -- we grow the economy from the middle class out. He wants to continue a lot of the progress we've seen over the past eight years, again, including the longest stretch of private sector job creation in our nation's history.\nSo I think you can expect him to make that case tonight. And obviously, we have some events tomorrow in Cleveland.\nQ: Eric, the CEO of Wells Fargo announced that he was stepping down. Does the President have any reaction? And how does he feel about Senator Warren saying that his resignation isn't enough, that he should actually have to pay back some of the money he made while Wells Fargo was going through some of the controversies over the last few years?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Sure, Toluse. I saw that again overnight. And we'll just say that the decision to have an executive step down rests with the company, so we're not going to comment on whether or not the decision was warranted or appropriate. But I will take this opportunity to address some of the broader issues that this misconduct highlights and why we need to continue to address them.\nPrincipally, the Wells Fargo matter demonstrates the importance of the CFPB, which is the first financial regulator dedicated solely to protecting consumers. The CFPB and other regulators have levied significant penalties here, and we welcome that. Based on their findings, this is exactly the type of behavior they're designated to guard against. We've seen Republicans -- some of whom are on the ballot in races that we just discussed -- want to dismantle the CFPB. They want to increase influence by the big banks.\nThe President believes that consumers need a voice in Washington. That's why he went ahead and created the CFPB, again, against stiff competition -- against stiff opposition, most notably from Republicans. And I believe that -- well, more importantly, the President believes that this is why we need safeguards in place.\nQ: Thanks, Eric.\nEND 1:06 P.M.

I can't believe it's just a few weeks before Election Day, as we come together to support the next President and Vice President of the United States, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine! (Applause.) And New Hampshire is going to be important, as always.\nSo I'm going to get a little serious here, because I think we can all agree that this has been a rough week in an already rough election. This week has been particularly interesting for me personally because it has been a week of profound contrast.\nSee, on Tuesday, at the White House, we celebrated the International Day of the Girl and Let Girls Learn. (Applause.) And it was a wonderful celebration. It was the last event that I'm going to be doing as First Lady for Let Girls Learn. And I had the pleasure of spending hours talking to some of the most amazing young women you will ever meet, young girls here in the U.S. and all around the world. And we talked about their hopes and their dreams. We talked about their aspirations. See, because many of these girls have faced unthinkable obstacles just to attend school, jeopardizing their personal safety, their freedom, risking the rejection of their families and communities.\nSo I thought it would be important to remind these young women how valuable and precious they are. I wanted them to understand that the measure of any society is how it treats its women and girls. (Applause.) And I told them that they deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and I told them that they should disregard anyone who demeans or devalues them, and that they should make their voices heard in the world. And I walked away feeling so inspired, just like I'm inspired by all the young people here -- (applause) -- and I was so uplifted by these girls. That was Tuesday.\nAnd now, here I am, out on the campaign trail in an election where we have consistently been hearing hurtful, hateful language about women -- language that has been painful for so many of us, not just as women, but as parents trying to protect our children and raise them to be caring, respectful adults, and as citizens who think that our nation's leaders should meet basic standards of human decency. (Applause.)\nThe fact is that in this election, we have a candidate for President of the United States who, over the course of his lifetime and the course of this campaign, has said things about women that are so shocking, so demeaning that I simply will not repeat anything here today. And last week, we saw this candidate actually bragging about sexually assaulting women. And I can't believe that I'm saying that a candidate for President of the United States has bragged about sexually assaulting women.\nAnd I have to tell you that I can't stop thinking about this. It has shaken me to my core in a way that I couldn't have predicted. So while I'd love nothing more than to pretend like this isn't happening, and to come out here and do my normal campaign speech, it would be dishonest and disingenuous to me to just move on to the next thing like this was all just a bad dream.\nThis is not something that we can ignore. It's not something we can just sweep under the rug as just another disturbing footnote in a sad election season. Because this was not just a \"lewd conversation.\" This wasn't just locker-room banter. This was a powerful individual speaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior, and actually bragging about kissing and groping women, using language so obscene that many of us were worried about our children hearing it when we turn on the TV.\nAnd to make matters worse, it now seems very clear that this isn't an isolated incident. It's one of countless examples of how he has treated women his whole life. And I have to tell you that I listen to all of this and I feel it so personally, and I'm sure that many of you do too, particularly the women. The shameful comments about our bodies. The disrespect of our ambitions and intellect. The belief that you can do anything you want to a woman.\nIt is cruel. It's frightening. And the truth is, it hurts. It hurts. It's like that sick, sinking feeling you get when you're walking down the street minding your own business and some guy yells out vulgar words about your body. Or when you see that guy at work that stands just a little too close, stares a little too long, and makes you feel uncomfortable in your own skin.\nIt's that feeling of terror and violation that too many women have felt when someone has grabbed them, or forced himself on them and they've said no but he didn't listen -- something that we know happens on college campuses and countless other places every single day. It reminds us of stories we heard from our mothers and grandmothers about how, back in their day, the boss could say and do whatever he pleased to the women in the office, and even though they worked so hard, jumped over every hurdle to prove themselves, it was never enough.\nWe thought all of that was ancient history, didn't we? And so many have worked for so many years to end this kind of violence and abuse and disrespect, but here we are, in 2016, and we're hearing these exact same things every day on the campaign trail. We are drowning in it. And all of us are doing what women have always done: We're trying to keep our heads above water, just trying to get through it, trying to pretend like this doesn't really bother us maybe because we think that admitting how much it hurts makes us as women look weak. Maybe we're afraid to be that vulnerable. Maybe we've grown accustomed to swallowing these emotions and staying quiet, because we've seen that people often won't take our word over his. Or maybe we don't want to believe that there are still people out there who think so little of us as women. Too many are treating this as just another day's headline, as if our outrage is overblown or unwarranted, as if this is normal, just politics as usual.\nBut, New Hampshire, be clear: This is not normal. This is not politics as usual. (Applause.) This is disgraceful. It is intolerable. And it doesn't matter what party you belong to -- Democrat, Republican, independent -- no woman deserves to be treated this way. None of us deserves this kind of abuse. (Applause.)\nAnd I know it's a campaign, but this isn't about politics. It's about basic human decency. It's about right and wrong. (Applause.) And we simply cannot endure this, or expose our children to this any longer -- not for another minute, and let alone for four years. (Applause.) Now is the time for all of us to stand up and say enough is enough. (Applause.) This has got to stop right now. (Applause.)\nBecause consider this: If all of this is painful to us as grown women, what do you think this is doing to our children? What message are our little girls hearing about who they should look like, how they should act? What lessons are they learning about their value as professionals, as human beings, about their dreams and aspirations? And how is this affecting men and boys in this country? Because I can tell you that the men in my life do not talk about women like this. And I know that my family is not unusual. (Applause.) And to dismiss this as everyday locker-room talk is an insult to decent men everywhere. (Applause.)\nThe men that you and I know don't treat women this way. They are loving fathers who are sickened by the thought of their daughters being exposed to this kind of vicious language about women. They are husbands and brothers and sons who don't tolerate women being treated and demeaned and disrespected. (Applause.) And like us, these men are worried about the impact this election is having on our boys who are looking for role models of what it means to be a man. (Applause.)\nIn fact, someone recently told me a story about their six-year-old son who one day was watching the news -- they were watching the news together. And the little boy, out of the blue, said, \"I think Hillary Clinton will be President.\" And his mom said, \"Well, why do you say that?\" And this little six-year-old said, \"Because the other guy called someone a piggy, and,\" he said, \"you cannot be President if you call someone a piggy.\" (Applause.)\nSo even a six-year-old knows better. A six-year-old knows that this is not how adults behave. This is not how decent human beings behave. And this is certainly not how someone who wants to be President of the United States behaves. (Applause.)\nBecause let's be very clear: Strong men -- men who are truly role models -- don't need to put down women to make themselves feel powerful. (Applause.) People who are truly strong lift others up. People who are truly powerful bring others together. And that is what we need in our next President. We need someone who is a uniting force in this country. We need someone who will heal the wounds that divide us, someone who truly cares about us and our children, someone with strength and compassion to lead this country forward. (Applause.)\nAnd let me tell you, I'm here today because I believe with all of my heart that Hillary Clinton will be that President. (Applause.)\nSee, we know that Hillary is the right person for the job because we've seen her character and commitment not just in this campaign, but over the course of her entire life. The fact is that Hillary embodies so many of the values that we try so hard to teach our young people. We tell our young people \"Work hard in school, get a good education.\" We encourage them to use that education to help others -- which is exactly what Hillary did with her college and law degrees, advocating for kids with disabilities, fighting for children's health care as First Lady, affordable child care in the Senate. (Applause.)\nWe teach our kids the value of being a team player, which is what Hillary exemplified when she lost the 2008 election and actually agreed to work for her opponent as our Secretary of State -- (applause) -- earning sky-high approval ratings serving her country once again. (Applause.)\nWe also teach our kids that you don't take shortcuts in life, and you strive for meaningful success in whatever job you do. Well, Hillary has been a lawyer, a law professor, First Lady of Arkansas, First Lady of the United States, a U.S. senator, Secretary of State. And she has been successful in every role, gaining more experience and exposure to the presidency than any candidate in our lifetime -- more than Barack, more than Bill. (Applause.) And, yes, she happens to be a woman. (Applause.)\nAnd finally, we teach our kids that when you hit challenges in life, you don't give up, you stick with it. Well, during her four years as Secretary of State alone, Hillary has faced her share of challenges. She's traveled to 112 countries, negotiated a ceasefire, a peace agreement, a release of dissidents. She spent 11 hours testifying before a congressional committee. We know that when things get tough, Hillary doesn't complain. She doesn't blame others. She doesn't abandon ship for something easier. No, Hillary Clinton has never quit on anything in her life. (Applause.)\nSo in Hillary, we have a candidate who has dedicated her life to public service, someone who has waited her turn and helped out while waiting. (Applause.) She is an outstanding mother. She has raised a phenomenal young woman. She is a loving, loyal wife. She's a devoted daughter who cared for her mother until her final days. And if any of us had raised a daughter like Hillary Clinton, we would be so proud. We would be proud. (Applause.)\nAnd regardless of who her opponent might be, no one could be more qualified for this job than Hillary -- no one. And in this election, if we turn away from her, if we just stand by and allow her opponent to be elected, then what are we teaching our children about the values they should hold, about the kind of life they should lead? What are we saying?\nIn our hearts, we all know that if we let Hillary's opponent win this election, then we are sending a clear message to our kids that everything they're seeing and hearing is perfectly okay. We are validating it. We are endorsing it. We're telling our sons that it's okay to humiliate women. We're telling our daughters that this is how they deserve to be treated. We're telling all our kids that bigotry and bullying are perfectly acceptable in the leader of their country. Is that what we want for our children?\nAUDIENCE: No!\nMRS. OBAMA: And remember, we won't just be setting a bad example for our kids, but for our entire world. Because for so long, America has been a model for countries across the globe, pushing them to educate their girls, insisting that they give more rights to their women. But if we have a President who routinely degrades women, who brags about sexually assaulting women, then how can we maintain our moral authority in the world? How can we continue to be a beacon of freedom and justice and human dignity? (Applause.)\nWell, fortunately, New Hampshire, here's the beauty: We have everything we need to stop this madness. You see, while our mothers and grandmothers were often powerless to change their circumstances, today, we as women have all the power we need to determine the outcome of this election. (Applause.)\nWe have knowledge. We have a voice. We have a vote. And on November the 8th, we as women, we as Americans, we as decent human beings can come together and declare that enough is enough, and we do not tolerate this kind of behavior in this country. (Applause.)\nRemember this: In 2012, women's votes were the difference between Barack winning and losing in key swing states, including right here in New Hampshire. (Applause.) So for anyone who might be thinking that your one vote doesn't really matter, or that one person can't really make a difference, consider this: Back in 2012, Barack won New Hampshire by about 40,000 votes, which sounds like a lot. But when you break that number down, the difference between winning and losing this state was only 66 votes per precinct. Just take that in. If 66 people each precinct had gone the other way, Barack would have lost.\nSo each of you right here today could help swing an entire precinct and win this election for Hillary just by getting yourselves, your families, and your friends and neighbors out to vote. You can do it right here. (Applause.) But you could also help swing an entire precinct for Hillary's opponent with a protest vote or by staying home out of frustration.\nBecause here's the truth: Either Hillary Clinton or her opponent will be elected President this year. And if you vote for someone other than Hillary, or if you don't vote at all, then you are helping to elect her opponent. And just think about how you will feel if that happens. Imagine waking up on November the 9th and looking into the eyes of your daughter or son, or looking into your own eyes as you stare into the mirror. Imagine how you'll feel if you stayed home, or if you didn't do everything possible to elect Hillary.\nWe simply cannot let that happen. We cannot allow ourselves to be so disgusted that we just shut off the TV and walk away. And we can't just sit around wringing our hands. Now, we need to recover from our shock and depression and do what women have always done in this country. We need you to roll up your sleeves. We need to get to work. (Applause.) Because remember this: When they go low, we go --\nAUDIENCE: High!\nMRS. OBAMA: Yes, we do. (Applause.)\nAnd voting ourselves is a great start, but we also have to step up and start organizing. So we need you to make calls, and knock on doors, and get folks to the polls on Election Day, and sign up to volunteer with one of the Hillary campaign folks who are here today just waiting for you to step up. (Applause.)\nAnd, young people and not-so-young people, get on social media. (Applause.) Share your own story of why this election matters, why it should matter for all people of conscience in this country. There is so much at stake in this election.\nSee, the choice you make November 8th could determine whether we have a President who treats people with respect -- or not. A President who will fight for kids, for good schools, for good jobs for our families -- or not. A President who thinks that women deserve the right to make our own choices about our bodies and our health -- or not. (Applause.) That's just a little bit of what's at stake.\nSo we cannot afford to be tired or turned off. And we cannot afford to stay home on Election Day. Because on November the 8th, we have the power to show our children that America's greatness comes from recognizing the innate dignity and worth of all our people. On November the 8th, we can show our children that this country is big enough to have a place for us all -- men and women, folks of every background and walk of life -- and that each of us is a precious part of this great American story, and we are always stronger together. (Applause.)\nOn November 8th, we can show our children that here in America, we reject hatred and fear -- (applause) -- and in difficult times, we don't discard our highest ideals. No, we rise up to meet them. We rise up to perfect our union. We rise up to defend our blessings of liberty. We rise up to embody the values of equality and opportunity and sacrifice that have always made this country the greatest nation on Earth. (Applause.)\nThat is who we are. (Applause.) And don't ever let anyone tell you differently. (Applause.) Hope is important. Hope is important for our young people. And we deserve a President who can see those truths in us -- a President who can bring us together and bring out the very best in us. Hillary Clinton will be that President. (Applause.)\nSo for the next 26 days, we need to do everything we can to help her and Tim Kaine win this election. I know I'm going to be doing it. Are you with me? (Applause.) Are you all with me? (Applause.) You ready to roll up your sleeves? Get to work knocking on doors?\nAll right, let's get to work. Thank you all. God bless.

Conference attendees will participate in a national conversation about keeping America and Americans on the cutting edge of innovation in the decades to come, and share work already in progress. In addition, the President will further explore the five themes of the conference in the November issue of WIRED, which will be guest-edited by the President on the theme of \"Frontiers.\"\nThe Administration is opening the conference with more than $300 million in announcements that exemplify the critical roles that Federal investments, innovative policymaking, and multi-sector collaboration play in seeding prosperity:\n•      $70 million in new National Institutes of Health (NIH) investments to help researchers better understand the brain and, ultimately, uncover the mysteries that hold the key to future scientific breakthroughs in areas such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, depression, and traumatic brain injury.\n•      $16 million and four new partners within the Precision Medicine Initiative national research study, doubling the number of regional medical health care organizations that will enroll individuals into the large scale health study and push the boundaries of medical care and research innovation.\n•      $165 million in public and private funds to support cities in using technology and data to tackle critical quality-of-life challenges, such as traffic congestion.\n•      Harnessing the power of data to improve the U.S. criminal justice system, announcing that the Police Data Initiative and the Data-Driven Justice Initiative have each grown to over 100 communities nationwide.\n•      Releasing a White House report on preparing for the future of artificial intelligence (AI), outlining the issues that society will have to grapple with to unlock the possibilities of AI.\n•      New steps to develop technology—such as deep-space habitats—to help meet the President's goal of sending a human mission to Mars by the 2030s.\n•      $50 million in Federal funds to fuel a revolution in small-satellite technology that could provide capabilities such as ubiquitous high-speed Internet connectivity and continuously updated imagery of the Earth.\n•      A new space-weather Executive Order to coordinate efforts to prepare the Nation for space-weather events.\nWhite House Frontiers Conference\nThe White House Frontiers Conference is the first of its kind—a day-long gathering hosted by President Obama to discuss and collaborate on the opportunities and challenges we as a Nation face over the next half-century and beyond.\nThe conference includes the participation of more than 700 innovators from across academia, industry, government, and civil society, who will discuss five frontiers of innovation:\n•      Personal frontiers in health care innovation and precision medicine;\n•      Local frontiers in building smart, inclusive communities, including through investments in open data and the Internet of things;\n•      National frontiers in harnessing the potential of artificial intelligence, including data science, machine learning, automation, and robotics to engage and benefit all Americans;\n•      Global frontiers in accelerating the clean energy revolution and developing advanced climate information, tools, services, and collaborations; and\n•      Interplanetary frontiers in space exploration, including our journey to Mars.\nAdditional themes cut across the conference's programming, including:\n•      The importance of cross-sector and multi-disciplinary collaboration for solving difficult challenges;\n•      Education innovation to develop skills for Americans at all levels;\n•      Job creation across these sectors; and\n•      Equity, to ensure all Americans have access to these innovations and benefit from advances in these frontiers.\nParticipants will have the opportunity to engage in in-depth conversations, view technology demonstrations, hear lighting talks, share work already in progress, and learn from a diverse array of perspectives. In addition to those attending in person, components of the conference will be livestreamed, and there will be digital opportunities for the public to participate in this critical conversation. Learn more about the conference, including the agenda and speakers, here.\nAnnouncements Being Made to Open the Conference\nPersonal Frontiers\nScience, technology, and innovation funded by the Federal Government have made major contributions to helping Americans live longer, healthier lives. We have vaccines to protect us from devastating diseases like cervical cancer, flu, and meningitis. We have developed an artificial retina and have achieved promising initial results on brain control of robotic prosthetic arms.\nJust as the seeds for these breakthroughs were planted decades ago, President Obama's visionary investments in biomedical research, medicine, health, and the life sciences have set the stage for the cures, treatments, and innovations of the future. Today, the Administration is announcing forward momentum in two critical biomedical initiatives:\n•      Revolutionizing our understanding of the brain, with $70 million in new investments by NIH in FY 2016. In 2013, President Obama launched the BRAIN Initiative—Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies—to \"accelerate the development and application of new technologies that will enable researchers to produce dynamic pictures of the brain that show how individual brain cells and complex neural circuits interact at the speed of thought.\" Today's announcement of over 100 new awards brings the NIH investment in the BRAIN Initiative to just over $150 million in fiscal year 2016 and represents a doubling of the total number of awards made by NIH under the initiative. Moving forward, NIH is also announcing more than two dozen new funding opportunities planned for fiscal year 2017 activities, including proposals to produce a complete census of cells in the mouse brain along with the data infrastructure to make that information readily available to the research community. Since its launch in April 2013, the President's BRAIN Initiative has catalyzed $1.5 billion in public and private funds, with more than 125 academic papers published tied to the effort and active research programs in five Federal agencies: the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the NIH, the National Science Foundation, Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, and the Food and Drug Administration.\n•      Building partnerships to enable precision medicine for all. In his 2015 State of the Union address, President Obama announced the launch of the Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI), to accelerate a new era of medicine that delivers the right treatment at the right time to the right individual based on the complex and unknown interactions between one's genes, environment, and lifestyle. As part of this effort—newly named the All of Us Research Program—NIH is building one of the largest, most diverse research studies in history with healthcare organizations, technology partners, community collaborators, and participants. Today, the NIH is announcing four additional partners to double the number of regional medical healthcare organizations that will enroll individuals across the United States into this national study of health. With up to $16 million of additional awards, these new partners will bring research expertise, increased geographic reach (bringing in communities from Pennsylvania, New England, Minnesota, Michigan, Texas, and California), and new methods of engaging hard-to-reach communities to the table. They will help to build a rich, secure database and set of tools that empower thousands of researchers—from citizen scientists to academics—to use this unprecedented repository of electronic health record, medication, survey, biospecimen, genomic, imaging, and wearable data to accelerate breakthroughs that will only be possible with a diverse population of volunteers.\nLocal Frontiers\nWith nearly two-thirds of Americans living in urban settings, many of our complex challenges—from building transportation that fuels equitable growth, to improved community-police relationships—will require cities of all sizes to be laboratories for innovation. The rapid pace of social innovation and technological change—from the rise of data science, machine learning, human-centered approaches, artificial intelligence, the sharing economy, citizen science, social networks, and ubiquitous sensor networks to autonomous vehicles—holds significant promise for addressing core local challenges, not only in urban areas, but also in communities throughout the country. In fact, further advances in connectivity and network innovations hold promise for ensuring small towns, tribal communities, and rural areas benefit from technological advances and also serve as laboratories for innovation. Today, to harness these opportunities, the Administration is announcing:\n•      More than $165 million in public and private funds leveraged by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to deploy smart city technologies in communities across the country, including Pittsburgh. Last September, the White House launched the Smart Cities Initiative to make it easier for cities, Federal agencies, universities, and the private sector to work together to harness new technologies that can help make our cities more inhabitable, cleaner, and more equitable. As part of that effort, today, DOT is building on its successful Smart City Challenge by announcing nearly $65 million through two new grant programs, and leveraging over $100 million in matching funds for advanced transportation technologies. Pittsburgh (PA), San Francisco (CA), Houston (TX), Denver (CO), Los Angeles (CA), Buffalo (NY), and Marysville (OH) are receiving funds targeted at relieving congestion and improving safety of urban transportation networks. For example, Pittsburgh will receive nearly $11 million to execute elements of the vision it developed in its Smart City Challenge application, including deployment of smart traffic signal technology—proven to reduce congestion at street lights by up to 40 percent—along major travel corridors. Denver will also receive approximately $6 million to implement components of the vision developed in its Smart City Challenge application, helping to alleviate the congestion caused by a daily influx of 200,000 commuters each workday through connected vehicles. DOT is also announcing nearly $8 million in new grants for urban and rural communities to experiment with integrating new on-demand mobility services—including smartphone-enabled car sharing, demand-responsive buses, paratransit, and bike-sharing—into existing transit systems. For example, TriMet, which serves Portland, Oregon, will receive funds to integrate shared-use mobility options into its existing trip planning app, allowing users to plan efficient trips even without nearby transit access.\n•      Initiatives to enable data-driven policing and criminal justice systems have both grown to over 100 communities. Last year, the Administration launched the Police Data Initiative (PDI) to use data transparency to strengthen police-community relations, by fostering a culture of engagement and accountability. To date, 127 participating law enforcement agencies, serving more than 44 million people, have collectively released over 170 data sets that focus on areas such as traffic and pedestrian stops, use of force, and community engagement. To help establish and disseminate best practices, the Department of Justice's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) will support this initial cohort through its expanded Collaborative Reform efforts, which bring resources to focus on institutionalizing recommendations from the President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing. In addition, earlier this year, to break cycles of incarceration, the Administration launched the Data-Driven Justice Initiative(DDJ) with a bipartisan coalition of city, county, and State governments committed to using data-driven strategies to divert low-level offenders with mental illness out of the criminal justice system and to change approaches to pre-trial incarceration so that low-risk offenders no longer stay in jail simply because they cannot afford a bond. As of today, DDJ has grown to 119 participating jurisdictions covering over 90 million Americans. These jurisdictions are actively implementing data exchanges to identify high utilizers of services and sharing best practices for diversions and coordination with community-based services. Further, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) will collaborate with DDJ to launch up-to three pilot projects in DDJ-affiliated communities. With the goal of reducing unnecessary criminal justice involvement for Veterans, the pilot projects will build and refine a robust model for collaboration between local VA health centers, law-enforcement, behavioral health, and treatment services. The Department of Housing and Urban Development will also provide targeted support to help DDJ communities link data across criminal justice, health, and homelessness systems, so that these systems can better identify and serve those most in need, and help avoid emergency room visits, jails, and shelter stays in the first place. Learn more about these announcements here.\nNational Frontiers\nIn the popular press, the technology sector, the research community, and society as a whole, there is growing interest in artificial intelligence (AI) and the potential of computers capable of intelligent behavior. After years of steady but slow progress on making computers \"smarter\" at everyday tasks, a series of breakthroughs in recent years in the research community and industry have spurred momentum and investment in the development of this field and brought us to the precipice of transformative change.\nThough today's AI is confined to narrow, specific tasks, the rate of recent progress will have broad implications for fields ranging from health care to image- and voice-recognition. AI could deliver transformative solutions in health diagnostics, personalized learning, economic inclusion, bias mitigation, and autonomous transportation. But like any emerging technology, AI also carries risk and presents complex policy challenges along several dimensions, from jobs and the economy to safety and regulatory questions. That is why the Administration is today releasing:\n•      A First-Ever White House Report on the Future of Artificial Intelligence. Earlier this year, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy launched a broad consultation process, co-hosting five public workshops, including participation from academia, industry, and non-profits on topics in AI to spur public dialogue on artificial intelligence and machine learning and identify challenges and opportunities related to this emerging technology. With input from those cross-sector conversations, as well as the expertise of Federal agencies, the National Science and Technology Council is releasing a public report, Preparing for the Future of Artificial Intelligence, which surveys the state of AI, its many applications, and the questions AI raises for society and public policy. The report also makes recommendations for further action and sets out a roadmap for how the Federal Government and the country should approach AI in the coming years.\n•      A companion strategic plan for research and development in AI. A new National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Planbeing released today by the National Information Technology Research and Development program lays out a framework for Federally-funded research and development in AI.\nGlobal Frontiers\nUnder the determined leadership of President Obama, the United States has been one of the nations leading the world over the past 8 years in taking substantial steps to address the challenge of climate change. In addition to leading efforts on the world stage, such as the historic Paris Climate Agreement, the Administration has pursued climate strategies in science, technology, and innovation that have set the stage for further breakthroughs. The United States, 20 other countries, and the European Union are part of Mission Innovation, a global initiative to accelerate clean energy innovation. Participating countries are seeking to double their public funding of clean-energy research and development over the next 5 years, to nearly $30 billion per year by 2021. In the weeks ahead, the Administration will publish a new framework for U.S. participation in Mission Innovation, advancing a portfolio of technology options, including new game-changing possibilities, which hold the potential to reduce emissions, while simultaneously building on the growth of the new energy economy. In addition, to help unleash the next wave of clean energy breakthroughs, the Administration launched the Clean Energy Investment Initiative with foundations, institutional investors, and other long-term investors, announcing more than $4 billion in commitments to finance clean energy innovations and climate change solutions.\nIn addition, the Administration launched a number of efforts to advance climate data, information, tools, and services, including the Climate Data Initiative, U.S. Climate Resilience Toolkit, Climate Services for Resilient Development, and Partnership for Resilience and Preparedness. These efforts aim to better connect innovators, community leaders, and companies to climate science to support their planning. Over 1,000 climate data sets and hundreds of tools have been made available through these resources. The Administration also developed a Climate Education and Literacy Initiative to ensure that students and citizens understand climate change and are equipped with the knowledge, skills, and training to seek and implement solutions.\nThe pace and magnitude of climate change requires an all-hands-on-deck approach at the frontier of global innovation. At the White House Frontiers Conference, participants will discuss the possibilities that the next stages of this work can hold—advancing clean-energy innovation, providing communities with the climate-impacts information they need, and integrating climate science into education to foster a next-generation workforce who can design a climate-smart future.\nInterplanetary Frontiers\nAt the beginning of his Administration, President Obama set out a new vision for space exploration, harking back to the spirit of possibility and exploration that defined the space race of the 1960s, while building upon and advancing 21st century technologies and capabilities. In 2010, the Administration restructured the U.S. civil space program to look forward to bold new goals, not backwards to old ones; to collaborate with, rather than compete with, American entrepreneurs; and to broaden participation and take advantage of new technologies being created at NASA and in America's laboratories.\nAs President Obama noted earlier this week, these policies have fostered a burgeoning commercial space sector that is creating new jobs in places such as California, Colorado, Florida, Texas, and Washington, as the space economy attracts record amounts of venture capital. Working with NASA, American companies have developed new spacecraft that are cost-effectively delivering cargo to the International Space Station and will start ferrying astronauts there by the end of next year.\nIn 2011, the Administration created a new organization within NASA—a Space Technology Mission Directorate—charged with developing new technologies that would enhance capabilities and reduce costs for both the U.S. space industry and NASA's missions, including critical technologies needed to achieve the President's goal of a human mission to Mars in the 2030s. These technologies range from better life-support systems to efficient solar-powered electric propulsion systems. Much of this work is being performed in cooperation with companies and universities across the Nation.\nAnd now, the Administration has started collaborating with industry to build the space modules or \"habitats\" in which U.S. astronauts will live and travel to Mars and other deep-space destinations. By doing so, humanity will begin to move beyond the constraints of Earth, out into the depths of deep space—the \"proving ground\" that will ultimately guide us to Mars and beyond. And in the coming years, the work NASA will do—in collaboration with private and international partners—to develop these deep-space habitats will in turn help reduce the barriers to private companies that hope to build their own space stations in Earth orbit or beyond.\nThis fall, NASA will also start the process of providing companies with a potential opportunity to add their own modules and other capabilities to the International Space Station. As NASA shifts the focus of its human exploration program to deep space, America's businesses will take a larger role in supporting space activities in Earth's orbit.\nTo further build on this momentum, the Administration is announcing:\n•      Over $50 million in new Federal investments and steps that will harness the small-satellite revolution. Entrepreneurs are taking advantage of recent advances in electronics and information technology to dramatically reduce the time and cost of designing, building, testing, and launching constellations of satellites. In the coming weeks, Federal agencies will announce investments and new steps they will take to advance the state of the art in small-satellite technology and increase the adoption of \"smallsats\" for commercial, scientific, and national security needs. Advancing smallsat technology and adoption could, for example, allow companies to provide ubiquitous high-speed Internet connectivity and offer continuously updated imagery of the Earth. As part of this initiative, NASA will invest $30 million to support public-private partnership opportunities that allow for Earth Science observations to be provided by constellations of commercial small spacecraft. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency has just entered into a $20 million data purchase agreement with smallsat startup Planet to buy imagery from its constellation of earth-orbiting spacecraft.\n•      A new Executive Order to coordinate efforts to prepare the Nation for space-weather events. Building on the National Space Weather Strategy and National Action Plan released last October, today the President will sign an Executive Order that will help minimize the harm that space-weather events can cause across our Nation. The new Executive Order will minimize economic loss and save lives by enhancing national security, identifying successful mitigation technologies, and ordering the creation of nationwide response and recovery plans and procedures. Further, the Executive Order will enhance the scientific and technical capabilities of the United States, including improved prediction of space-weather events and their effects on infrastructure systems and services. By this action, the Federal Government will lead by example and help motivate State and local governments, and other nations, to create communities that are more resilient to the hazards of space weather.\nA Sustained Focus by President Obama on Science, Technology, and Innovation\nSince day one of his Administration, President Obama has taken a long-term view, prioritizing the investments, innovative policy actions, and cross-sector collaboration critical to fueling America's long-term prosperity. In April 2009, he outlined an ambitious agenda to reinvigorate the American scientific and technological enterprise in a speech at the annual meeting of the National Academy of Sciences.\nIn the nearly 8 years since, the full scope of the President's science, technology, and innovation agenda has been sweeping, and is already setting the stage for new industries and continued innovation in the years ahead. For example:\n•      This Administration has launched anetwork of nine manufacturing institutes, which are helping American manufactures lead the world in innovation.\n•      Compared to 2008, wind power has tripled in production and solar power has increased 30-fold.\n•      The Administration launched major new science initiatives to advance health care through precision medicine, understanding the brain, accelerating progress in treating and preventing cancer, and combating antibiotic resistance.\n•      Over the last 3 years, an additional 20 million U.S. school kids have become connected to high-speed Internet, and the number of schools lacking high-speed connectivity has been cut in half.\n•      The Administration has taken steps to support the safe integration of unmanned aircraft systems into the national airspace and the safe introduction of self-driving cars onto the Nation's roads.\n•      U.S. companies that got their start supporting U.S. Government space missions have increased their share of the global commercial launch market from zero in 2011 to 36 percent in 2015.\n•      100,000 engineers are graduating yearly from American universities for the first time ever, we are on track to prepare 100,000 STEM teachers by 2021, and the President set a bold vision to give every child an opportunity to learn computer science.\n•      In December 2015, Congress responded to the President's call (dating to 2009) and made the research and experimentation (R&E) tax credit permanent.\n•      Federal agencies have made more than 180,000 Federal datasets and collections available to students, entrepreneurs, and the public.\nRead more examples of President Obama's leadership in science, technology, and innovation.", "timestamp": "2016-10-13", "title": "Fact Sheet: Harnessing the Possibilities of Science, Technology, and Innovation"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "The President spoke at 3:21 p.m. in the Wiegand Gym at the Jared L. Cohon University Center. In his remarks, he referred to Alexis Chidi, postdoctoral student, Medical Scientist Training Program of the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University; Christine Darden, Margery Hannah, and Katherine G. Johnson, mathematicians and former employees, NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA; and Dunbar, PA, resident Nathan Copeland, a patient at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in Pittsburgh, PA.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119505", "text": "The President. Thank you, everybody. Please have a seat. Thank you. Well, thank you, Alexis, for that introduction. I love that story that she bumped into me on the elevator. What she didn't mention, by the way, is that she started on her pre-med degree when she was 16, bumping into me in the elevator. She was already well on her way. So, to the rest of you, good luck. [Laughter] Hope you already have tenure, because Alexis is coming. [Laughter]\nI'm only going to speak briefly today because we have an amazing panel and I want to learn from the people who are in attendance here today. But I want to start by recognizing Mayor Peduto of Pittsburgh, who has been an extraordinary innovator and city leader. And give—[applause]—yes. Congressman Doyle, who fully supports our innovation agenda, and we need strong allies in Congress, so give Mike Doyle a big round of applause, please.\nWe also have people from across our agencies: Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx, NIH Director Francis Collins, National Science Foundation Director France Cordova. And I want to thank two extraordinary leaders who once served in my administration and did extraordinary work: President Suresh of Carnegie Mellon and Chancellor Gallagher of Pitt. Part of, sort of, the Obama alumni mafia here. [Laughter] As well as all the faculty and students and staff here at CMU and Pitt for allowing us to turn your campuses into a science fiction movie for the day. [Laughter]\nEarlier today I got a chance to see some pretty cool stuff. A space capsule designed by the private sector to carry humans out of our atmosphere. Small, unmanned quadcopters that can search disaster areas and survey hard-to-reach places on bridges that might need repairs. I also successfully docked a capsule on the International Space Station. It was a simulation, but I—trust me, I stuck the landing. [Laughter]\nBut here's the thing about Pittsburgh: This kind of stuff is really nothing new. Most folks have probably heard about how this city is testing out a fleet of self-driving cars. But Pittsburgh has been revitalizing itself through technology for a very long time. There is a reason that U.S. Steel Tower is now also the corporate home of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, because the Steel City is now home to groundbreaking medical research and world-class universities. It's the birthplace of some of the most advanced artificial intelligence and robotics systems the world has ever seen. And you are investing in your young people with afterschool STEM programs and maker faires, and \"Girls of Steel\" robotics teams. And that's how this city came back after an iconic industry fell on tougher times: doubling down on science, doubling down on tech, doubling down on innovation, all of which can create amazing new jobs and opportunities.\nAnd stories like that are not just happening here in Pittsburgh or in Silicon Valley. They're happening in Chattanooga and in Charleston and in Cincinnati, cities where we're seeing science and technology spur new jobs and new industries, new discoveries that are improving our lives and, in many cases, saving lives.\nAnd that's consistent with this Nation, who we are: a nation born from an idea that became the world's laboratory. There aren't a lot of countries where one of your Founding Fathers has an idea to fly a kite in a thunderstorm and helps to fundamentally change how we think about electricity. A place where the women who solved the equations to take us into space, even though they weren't always acknowledged. A nation whose engineers brought us the Internet. Innovation is in our DNA. Science has always been central to our progress, and it's playing a leading role in overcoming so many of our greatest challenges.\nThat's as true today as it's ever been. Only with science can we make a shift to cleaner sources of energy and take steps to save the only planet we have. Only with science do we have the chance to cure cancer or Parkinson's or other diseases that steal our loved ones from us way too soon. Only through science will we have the capacity to reengineer our cities as populations grow, to be smarter and more productive, to lead humanity farther out into the final frontiers of space—not just to visit, but to stay—and ensure that America keeps its competitive advantage as the world's most innovative economy.\nAnd some of—I was doing some pictures before I came out here with some folks, and they said, thank you so much for what you've done for science. And I confessed, I am a science geek. I'm a nerd. [Laughter] And I don't make any apologies for it. [Applause] I don't make any apologies for it. It's cool stuff. [Laughter] And it is that thing that sets us apart: that ability to imagine and hypothesize and then test and figure stuff out and tinker and make things and make them better and then break them down and rework them.\nAnd that's why I get so riled up when I hear people willfully ignore facts—[laughter]—or stick their heads in the sands about basic scientific consensus. It's not just that that position leads to bad policy, it's also that it undermines the very thing that has always made America the engine for innovation around the world. It's not just that they're saying climate change is a hoax or taking a snowball on the Senate floor to prove that the planet's not getting warmer. [Laughter] It's that they're doing everything they can to gut funding for research and development, failing to make the kinds of investments that brought us breakthroughs like GPS and MRIs and put Siri on our smartphones, and stonewalling even military plans that don't adhere to ideology.\nThat's not who we are. We don't listen to science just when it fits our ideologies or when it produces the results that we want. That's the path to ruin. Sixty years ago, when the Russians beat us into space, we didn't deny that Sputnik was up there. [Laughter] That wouldn't have worked. No. We acknowledged the facts, and then we built a space program almost overnight and then beat them to the Moon. And then, we kept on going, becoming the first country to take an up-close look at every planet in the solar system. That's who we are. That's where facts will get you. [Laughter] That's where science will get you.\nAnd that's why, in my first Inaugural Address, I vowed to return science to its rightful place. And by the way, I want to make clear: This idea that facts and reason and science are somehow inimical to faith and feelings and human values and passions, I reject that. For us to use our brains doesn't mean that we lose our heart. It means that we can harness what's in our heart to actually get things done.\nAnd that's why in the first few months of my administration, we made the single largest investment in basic research in our history, because innovation is not a luxury that we do away with when we're tightening our belts. It's precisely at those moments, when we've got real challenges, when we double down on new solutions that can lead to new jobs and new industries and a stronger economy. So, over these last 8 years, we've worked to recruit the best and brightest tech talent into the administration. We've partnered with academia and the private sector. We've empowered citizen scientists to take on some of our biggest challenges. We've reimagined our Federal approach to science through incentive prizes and 21st-century moonshots for cancer, and brain research, and solar energy. We've turbocharged the clean energy revolution. We've built the architecture to unleash the potential of precision medicine, dropped enough new broadband infrastructure to circle the globe four times, applied data and evidence to social policy to find out what works; scale up when it works, stop funding things that don't, thereby fostering a new era of social innovation.\nWe've helped once-dark factories start humming again, putting folks to work manufacturing wind turbine blades longer than the wingspan of a 747. And we realized that we can't look to the future if we're also not going to lift up the generation that's going to occupy that future. So we started the White House Science Fair to teach our kids to send a message that the winner of the Super Bowl isn't the only one that deserves a celebration in the East Room. We hooked up more of our classrooms and communities to the high-speed Internet that will help our kids compete. We're pushing to bring computer science to every student. We're on track to prepare 100,000 STEM teachers in a decade.\nAnd as a running thread throughout this, we are working to help all of our children understand that they, too, have a place in science and tech, not just boys in hoodies, but girls on Native American reservations, kids whose parents can't afford personal tutors. We want Jamal and Maria sitting right next to Jimmy and Johnny, because we don't want them overlooked for a job of the future.\nAmerica is about Thomas Edison and the Wright Brothers, but we're also the place you can grow up to be a Grace Hopper or George Washington Carver or a Katherine Jones [Johnson; White House correction.]\nor an Ida B. Wells. We're the nation that just had six of our scientists and researchers win Nobel Prizes, and every one of them was an immigrant.\nSo part of science, part of reasons, part of facts is recognizing that to get to where we need to go we need to lift everybody up, because we're going to be a better team if we've got the whole team. We don't want somebody with a brilliant idea not in the room because they're a woman. We don't want some budding genius unavailable to cure cancer or come up with a new energy source because they were languishing in a substandard school as a child.\nSo that's what I've been focused on. Alexis has done some things. I've done some things too. [Laughter] But look, I only get two terms and what——\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. Which is fine—[laughter]—because the Presidency is a relay race. We run our leg, then we hand off the baton. And that's why this conference isn't just about where we've been, it's about where we're going. We're looking to tomorrow. We're trying to institutionalize the work that we've been doing over these last 8 years. But we also want to make sure that these partnerships continue to thrive well beyond my administration. The future is yours to create. It's all of ours.\nAnd we've got a tremendous group here from all across America: from the sciences, from industry, from academia. All of you in your own fields are transformative. You're transforming the way we treat diseases and building smarter and more efficient and more inclusive communities. You're unlocking the data that can make our criminal justice system smarter and fairer. You're harnessing the power of artificial intelligence—big data robotics, automation—for the good of all of us. You're breaking new ground on clean energy and giving us our best hope of staving off the worst consequences of climate change. And you're taking us on that final frontier, firing up the boosters for humanity's journey to Mars.\nSo today I am proud to build on your work. We've announced Federal and private commitments totaling more than $300 million to throw into the pot: investing in smarter cities, expanding our Precision Medicine Initiative, spurring the development in small satellite technology. We're supporting researchers working to better understand our brains—how we think and learn and remember.\nAnd in fact, it's in that area where I'd like to close: brain research. Before I came onstage, about half an hour ago, I had the chance to meet an extraordinary young man named Nathan Copeland. And back in 2004, Nathan was a freshman in college, studying advanced sciences, interested in nanotechnology. And he was in a car accident that left him paralyzed. For years, Nathan could not move his arms, couldn't move his legs, needed help with day-to-day tasks.\nBut one day, he was contacted by a research team at Pitt, and they asked if he wanted to be involved in an experimental trial supported by DARPA, the same agency that gave us the Internet and night vision goggles and so much more. And since he was a scientist himself, Nathan readily agreed. So they implanted four microelectrode arrays into his brain, each about the size of half a button. And those implants connect neurons in his brain with a robotic arm so that today, he can move that arm the same way you and I do—just by thinking about it. But that's just the beginning. Nathan is also the first person in human history who can feel with his prosthetic fingers.\nThink about this. He hasn't been able to use his arms or legs for over a decade, but now he can once again feel the touch of another person. So we shook hands. He had a strong grip, but he had kind of toned it down. [Laughter] And then, we gave each other a fist bump.\nAnd researchers will tell you there's a long way to go; he still can't feel with his thumb or experience hot and cold, but he can feel pressure with precision. That's what science does. That's what American innovation can do. And imagine the breakthroughs that are around the corner. Imagine what's possible for Nathan if we keep on pushing the boundaries. And that's what this Frontiers Conference is all about: pushing the bounds of what is possible.\nAnd that's why I've been so committed to science and innovation, not just so that we can restore someone's sense of touch, but so we can revitalize communities, revitalize economies, reignite our shared sense of possibility and optimism. Because here in America, with the right investments, with the unbelievable brilliance and ingenuity of young people like Alexis and Nathan, there is nothing we cannot do. So let's keep it going. Let's get to work.\nWith that, I think it's time to start our panel. Thank you, everybody. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2016-10-13", "title": "Remarks at the White House Frontiers Conference at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}

Well, they tell me, Mr. President, to treat you like any other panel member.\nThe President. That's exactly right. [Laugher]\nDr. Gawande. I'm, like, right, okay. We'll try it, right? So I'm Atul Gawande. I'm a surgeon, I'm a public health researcher, and a staff writer at the New Yorker. I'm the executive director of Ariadne Labs, a health systems innovation center at the Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Chan School of Public Health. I'd like to welcome you. I'm the moderator today for this panel. To my left is a lawyer. [Laughter]\nI want to start, actually—you challenged us, in your talk and in what you wrote in Wired, to think bigger. So I want to start with each of you, and I'm going to ask you what you think the big opportunity is. And so first is Kaf Dzirasa, M.D., Ph.D., extraordinary—he's a rare bird. He is a psychiatrist, he's a neuroscientist, and he's trained as an engineer as well. He's on the faculty at Duke, and I want you to tell us what you think the big opportunity is for the future.\nDuke University Assistant Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Kafui Dzirasa. Yes, I think the big opportunity is for us to begin to think of the brain as an engineered system. So I will give an example of what I mean. Let me—if I look out into the crowd and I say, anyone who's excited of voting in the next few weeks, put your hands up. So let me—there we go.\nThe President. Come on, everybody. [Laughter] Let's get something to vote for.\nDr. Dzirasa. That's right. [Laughter] So let me talk about what happened in that.\n[At this point, Dr. Dzirasa made brief remarks, concluding as follows.]\nSo as we begin to think about these illnesses, whether it's Alzheimer's or autism, the challenge is, we're talking about a system that evolves so quickly and information is processed in multiple areas to generate behavior. The first time I heard someone describe the brain that way, I was a junior in college at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. And we had—invited a speaker, and he was one of my childhood heroes, he was a neurosurgeon. He will go unnamed. [Laughter]\nThe President. I know who you're talking—really good surgeon. [Laughter]\n[Dr. Dzirasa made additional remarks, concluding as follows.]\nDr. Dzirasa. And so I decided to pursue an interest in psychiatry, and as I sat there with families who were experiencing some of the same challenges that my family was experiencing, I realized that we just needed a breakthrough in how we think about and how we treat mental illness. That big breakthrough, I think, for me, is going to come through this brain initiative. The—it's the opportunity for engineers to engage in how we think about mental illness, to map out how the brain is processing information in real time, the activity of all of these cells. The promise is that one day we'll have a new form of treatment that becomes—that comes out of reading information from the brain, generating neuroprosthetics, in the same way that individuals are now moving their hands by thinking about it. Can we augment brain function in a way that allows those with mental illness to come out of the shadows and to continue to contribute to this great American system? So——\nThe President. That's great.\nDr. Gawande. Thank you for that. I'd like to introduce Riccardo Sabatini, who is a Silicon Valley quantum physicist who has turned his training to using machine learning around genomics and health at Human Longevity, Incorporated. I want you to tell us what you think the big opportunity is.\nHuman Longevity, Inc., Research Scientist Riccardo Sabatini. Yes, so I think one of the most exciting thing that happened in last 20 years is that we digitalized life. We took—we opened up biology to computation. And that happened in the middle of my studies. I'm a quantum physicist. I was working on nanotech for the longest time. And I realized all of a sudden that I could move my expertise, my numerical modeling, on life, on biology, on genomics. Near 2000, as a human species, we started to read our own code. This is a camera moment in science. And you, Mr. President, gave a Medal of Science to the very two people that helped, Francis Collins and Craig Venter. This allowed to take completely different techniques to study how our biology works. It's the hardest problem that we will ever face and that we ever encountered. But we are learning. We are taking AI, we are taking machine learning, quantum mechanics, and we are virtualizing parts of our biology to understand how a specific molecule, a drug, works on just your body, how another molecule can hit your specific cancer, extracting the genome of your cancer. We are learning how to read the weak signals, very, very early stage, to understand if we can predict some pathology that is growing and intervene fast.\nAnd this is a fascinating field, because it's the very field where numerical computation is saving life every day. It's the moment where we can predict and act at the same time. And this—when I saw this opportunity, I think is really—last century was about the atom, the next century is going about—is going to be about biology. Digitalizing allowed me to work in this field. And what I'm excited about is keeping going, virtualizing the human being better and better, understanding better and better, and taking this knowledge, opening up for all the community and all over the world, scaling down the prices, as we did with the genome sequencing, allowing more knowledge, and taking on board linguistics, physicians, physicists, mathematicians. This is the most important problem we have as a species, and we're going to crack it.\nThe President. That's great.\nDr. Gawande. Fantastic.\nMr. Sabatini. Thank you.\nDr. Gawande. I'd like to introduce Zoë Keating, who is not a scientist.\nPatient advocate Zoë Keating. No.\nDr. Gawande. Zoë is, first of all, an amazing San Francisco cellist and composer. She's someone who's had number-one classical recordings. At the same time, she's someone who had a journey with the health care system with her husband, who had a devastating cancer, and has been thinking a lot, as a patient advocate, about what that experience has meant. And so I wanted to ask you, from what you went through, what is the opportunity—what is the big opportunity that you see for the future? Ms. Keating. Well, I'll tell you the story, but I'll tell you the summary first. And in a nutshell, it's, like, how can we make lives better for patients? How can we ease suffering? How can we end the suffering? That's what it's about. And our story was that my husband, in 2014, was diagnosed with stage-4 lung cancer. And it took 5 months and three different doctors to find it.\n[Ms. Keating continued her remarks, concluding as follows.]\nBut if I could just say something else about patients, it's that during our journey, we never had the sense that there was one person keeping track of all the data, that if there was data—and I tried really hard to digitize all my husband's and get it to where it needed to go—how could I—where do I put it? Who do I give it to? Who do I trust? And in this future scenario, I can imagine where I would go into the doctor's office and they would know everything about me. And I would imagine there would be some AI that had done some, like, analysis on my data to, like, pop some things up for the doctor. But still there's a human. No matter how much technology you have, there's a human at the end of it to help a patient through their journey and to keep track of it all and to think about, like, their caregivers, their life, everything. It's all a big package. It's not just patients or the users. So——\nPrecision Medicine/Cancer Research/Health Care Reform\nDr. Gawande. If I were to tie together—it sounds incredibly disparate, but the story that is coming out from everything you're saying—I'm going to take what you said, Riccardo, about the last century, one step farther. The last century was the century of the molecule. We were trying to—the power of reductionism—boil it down to the most small possible part: the atom, the gene, the neuron. Give me the drug, the device, the superspecialist. And that provided enormous good.\nBut in this century, what they're all describing is, now we're trying to figure out how do they all fit together. How do the neurons fit together to create the kinds of behaviors that you're to solve in mental illness? How do they fit—the genes network can fit together in epigenetics to account for the health and disease of the future that we all may face? And Zoë is describing a superhighway of information and science that is plugging into the patient through a bike path called the doctor's office.\nAnd trying to make a system that can actually bring it all together really is a completely different kind of science from the last century. It's surrounding these problems. Who—with people come from incredibly different perspectives. Now, Kaf, you're all of them in one. We normally might bring a psychiatrist and an engineer and a neuroscientist together. [Laughter] And maybe—but it really isn't the age of the hero scientist anymore.\nAnd so I want to ask you: What do we have to reinvent about the way we do science to make all of this possible, genuinely, scientifically, with real innovation?\nThe President. Well, first of all, I want to thank the panelists, especially Zoë's, because of the story you're telling. Although, Kaf, it sounds like you were also inspired in part because of very personal experiences. At the end of the day, they're people who count and who we want to enhance their lives. And so being able to bring it down from 40,000 feet down to what you're experiencing while you're waiting on the phone to help somebody you love so deeply, I think, is a good reminder of why we do this.\nAs you say, Atul, what we've been calling this Precision Medicine Initiative is really: how do we stitch together systems that can maximize the potential of the research that a Kaf or a Riccardo are doing and end up with Zoë's husband getting better treatment? And a couple of things that we've tried to do that I think are helping.\nNumber one, is to make sure that the data that is being generated by genomic sequencing, as its price comes down, is better integrated and better shared, which is going to require us rethinking research models.\nIn the past, what's happened is, is that if a researcher wants to look into cancer, they get some samples from an arrangement, maybe, with a teaching university close by, and they're plugging away, somewhat in isolation. And what we now have is the opportunity to—as we discover, particularly, that what we think—used to think of as cancer might turn out to be 20 different types of cancer—we're now in a position where we can actually generate a huge database. And as a consequence, not only identify some of the specific features of that cancer, not only identify what kinds of genetic variants might make you more predisposed to that cancer, but we're also breaking down those silos in such a way where we can accelerate research. Not everybody has to have one small sample. Now, potentially, we've got a million people who are contributing to a database that somebody like a Kaf or a Riccardo can work off of.\nAnd what that allows us to do in developing cures is, over time, as Riccardo said, to identify, first of all, do you have a predisposition towards a particular disease, and can we intervene more quickly before you develop it? Second, can we develop better cures, interventions, as Kaf said. But third, are we also in a position to get this information to patients sooner to empower them so that they can be in charge of their own health? Because part of our goal here is to shift from what is really a disease care system to an actual health care system.\nSo that's one big chunk of the initiative. And just to be more specific, part of what we're doing with the Precision Medicine Initiative is to get a bunch of collaborators to start digitalizing, pooling, and sharing their data. Within the VA, we've got half a million folks who sign up and are contributing their genetic samples.\nWe now have more and more institutions that are coming together. And as a consequence, our hope is, is that if you are a cancer researcher in any particular cancer, you're going to have a big data set that you can start working off of. And by the way, we're being very intentional about making sure that we're reaching out to communities that sometimes are forgotten—whether it's African American communities, women—so that we can really pinpoint what works for who.\nDr. Gawande. Can I try pushing on some of that?\nThe President. Just one last thing——\nDr. Gawande. All right.\nThe President. ——I want to say, though, because it goes to what Zoë said about systems. Even as we're doing all this cool stuff to come up with greater cures, what we're also having to do is try to figure out what are the incentives—the perverse incentives—that are set up in the health care system that prevent it from reaching a patient earlier. So I'll just give two quick examples.\nThe first is what you were talking about in terms of your individual patient data. We're trying to promote the notion, number one, that this data belongs to you, the patient, as opposed to the institution that is treating you. Because once you understand that it's yours and you have agency in this process, it means that as you're looking for different treatment options, as you're consulting with different doctors, you're able to be a more effective advocate without having to constantly fill out paperwork and so forth. So that's important.\nAnd one of the things that we've discovered is, is that even the software where your individual patient data is stored, because it's a commercial enterprise oftentimes, is non—it's not interoperable, it's not sharable in an easy form. And so we've actually been trying to get some of the major providers to start working together so that it makes it easier for somebody like Zoë, if she's moving from system to system.\nThe second this is—and, Atul, you've written about this—to the extent that we are reimbursing doctors and hospitals and other providers based on outcomes rather than discrete services that are being provided, we can start incentivizing the kind of holistic system thinking in health care—rather than you come in, you get a test, then you've got to go to another place to do this, and then you've got to go to another thing to do that, and then maybe the surgeon hasn't talked—spoken to the primary care physician and you don't have the outpatient coordination that would make sure that you're not coming back into the hospital.\nAnd one of the things that we've been trying to do with the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, that hasn't gotten as much attention as just providing people insurance is to make sure that we're pushing, we're nudging the system more and more to do that.\nSo that was a long answer—[laughter]—but it's a big topic. The good news is, is that I think we've identified the pathways where we can start making real progress.\nCybersecurity/Privacy of Health Records\nDr. Gawande. I want to live in your world. I want to live in the world where——\nThe President. I'm only going to be here for 4 more months. So—[laughter]. Three and a half.\nDr. Gawande. ——in a world where I get to own—I have my genomic information, I have my medical records, I have—everything about me belongs to me, and it's easy to access, and I can bring it to the doctors that I need it to get to.\nThe second level, you announced an initiative today, the All of Us Research Initiative, where you would be able to, A, get that data and then share it with researchers so that they can learn more from you, trusting that that data is safe. I had worked in the Clinton administration, and I got notified that my background records, my clearance records were hacked, right? If you can hack all of my background records now, suppose you can hack my genetic information, all of my electronic records, my mental health information and more. And being able to trust—so we're in this world where the system—having system science only works if it's transparent and information is widely available. And yet we're in deep fear about what happens with information and making it widely available.\nI'd love to hear what you have to think about that. And I'm going to jump to Riccardo and think in a variety of worlds that you've been in, how do we trust that this research is in the right hands?\nThe President. I'll be very quick on this. This is going to be a ongoing problem that we have across disciplines. It's not just in health care. As Riccardo said, our lives become digitalized. It means that how we provide security for that information—whether it's financial, health, you name it—is going to be challenging. Now, the good news is that we are making real progress in understanding the architecture that we have to build across sectors, private and public, in order for—to make this work. In fact, our outstanding president of Pitt has been working with our cybersecurity committee to really crack some of these problems. And we've put some guidelines for the private sector and providers to assure best practices on cybersecurity. But it is going to be something that will be increasingly challenging.\nHere's the only thing I would say though. The opportunities to hack your information will be just as great or greater in a poorly integrated, broken-down health care system as it will be in a highly integrated, effective health care system. So I think it's important for us not to overstate the dangers of—the very real dangers of cybersecurity and ensuring the privacy of our health records. We don't want to so overstate it that that ends up becoming a significant impediment to us making the system work better. All right?\nDr. Gawande. Are there technological solutions, Riccardo, to this problem of privacy?\nMr. Sabatini. Yes. So we started to—one of the questions we started about a year ago is exactly, can we identify someone from his own genome? So we started to build a class of algorithm to predict and extract information from your genes, some common traits: your height, your eye color, your skin color, the structure of your face. Every single model has its own limitations, sometimes for the lack of data, sometimes because the data is not only in your genes.\nBut what we learned is that using them collectively, we can go a long way to really identify a person from his genome. So this is something that we have to face, is a digital asset that is one of the most complicated ways to be handled. We want to publish it, we want to share it, but it's still something—there is some concern about identity and security.\n[Mr. Sabatini continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]\nSo we need to remove a fear and allow people to engage more in their own health and in their own data. There are technologies to keep them safe and to keep them secure. The one thing that is very important is overcoming this barrier of knowing yourself, which I think is the most—is the hardest hurdle to scale up the databases. Security—there are the best people working on it across the border, both in the scientific domain and governmental domain. But this should not be a limitation to access your own information and feel comfortable to own your own information and feel comfortable to share it with governmental infrastructure and with companies that are implement the security right.\nTechnological Innovation/Health Care Reform/Accuracy of Online Information/Climate Change\nDr. Gawande. At the center of this, I think, is a question about optimism and pessimism about whether we can solve these problems. And I think I would like to ask a question of all of you about our values, the scientific values of a scientific orientation. And behind that orientation is a fundamental belief: We have an allegiance to the idea that the way you discover, the way you explain nature, the way you describe the world, the way you intervene in the world is through factual observation and through testing. And there's a certain sense of—it's an orientation, it's a way of being that we're describing. It's an openness, it's an inquisitiveness, it's curiosity. It's a willingness to acknowledge good arguments and recognize ones that are bad and that haven't tested out. And that orientation feels like, at times—on the one hand, it's been the most powerful, collective enterprise in human history, the scientific community. And at other times, it feels embattled. And I wonder why. Why does it seem under fire when we're—you mentioned, President Obama, that in certain areas like climate change or around nutrition or around other parts of medical care, we have enormously fraught debates? And it feels at this moment almost like we're not just debating what it means to be a scientist, but what it means to be a citizen.\nWhat do you take away, Kaf and Zoë, about where we are, and why are we under fire, and how do we get past this?\nDr. Dzirasa. I think, in a lot of ways, science, the outcome changes perspective, right? So when science is useful, we don't have people arguing about whether polio vaccines are great or not, right? And so I think there are a lot of areas in medicine where we face this challenge. I actually think debate is very healthy for science. Right? I think contentious debate can actually be very helpful for science, in the same way our country was set up in way that healthy, constructive debate can be extremely useful.\nI think what we want to do, especially as neuroscientists, I think we're at a place where we need to draw as many people in as possible and have healthy, constructive debates about how we get the outcomes we want.\n[Dr. Dzirasa continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]\nSo we're at a place now where we're going to have to bring in other disciplines to know how to handle that data. I sat with a high school kid last night, Gabe, and it was pretty clear to me that the people who were going to solve this challenge of the brain are probably in, like, seventh or eighth grade right now. Right? And so how do we create an ecosystem where all those different perspectives can come in. The utility is, when all those different perspectives come in, there has to be contentious debate, right? But I think the solutions that will come out of it are what will move people's perspective on the usefulness of science.\nDr. Gawande. Zoë, what do you think about the constructive debate you hear, how we get to the more constructive debate, and enough optimism that we want to actually put funding into the kind of work that Kaf is talking about?\nMs. Keating. Well, I think of just making it broader. I was really inspired this morning by a lot of the speakers on the health track, and one of them was Steven Keating, who's not related to me at all—another Keating—and I was really struck how—he was a Ph.D. student, and he was doing 3-D printing. And he wanted to study his brain tumor, because he had a brain tumor. But in order to study his tumor, he had to become a medical student in order to get some of the tumor so he could study it.\nAnd that seemed really—like, wow, that's limiting. Think of, like, all these amazing people we have in our country who are doing things, and increasingly, people are doing things outside of institutions. And I feel like that's where solutions are going to come from. Like, I think that we should also look at Silicon Valley. I was thinking about patients and how the whole patient issue I was having is kind of like a user-experience problem that somebody might tackle at a software startup, and maybe we should approach these things from different perspectives that way.\nAnd I think that's part of this trust—you were talking about trust in data—that somehow expanding, bringing in voices, figuring out how people can contribute data, how we can all just be more involved will be a way towards making trust. The same thing is true with government. So—[laughter].\nThe President. No, absolutely. Well, I'll just pick up on a couple of themes. Any scientific revolution is, by definition, contesting the status quo. And we're going through a period in which our knowledge is expanding very quickly. It is going to have a wide range of ramifications and you've got a whole bunch of legacy systems that are going to be affected. So if self-driving cars are pervasive, a huge percentage of the American population right now makes its living, and oftentimes a pretty good living, driving. And so, understandably, people are going to be concerned about what does this mean. The—we've heard of the controversies around Uber versus those who have taxi medallions, but it's actually driverless Uber that is going to be even more challenging.\nThe same is true in the health care field. One of the things that you discover is this Rube Goldberg contraption that grew up over the last 50 years or 60 years, in terms of our health care system, is there's all kinds of economics that are embedded in every aspect of it. So it's not surprising, then, that when we passed the Affordable Care Act, that there are going to be people who push back not just because they really want to make it work and they've got some legitimate, factual critiques of it, but because people's pocketbooks may be threatened.\nYou—and, Zoë, you just used one example, which was the enormous controversy we had when we said that we should phase out certain types of insurance that, on their face, look really cheap, until you have a tumor and it turns out that they don't cover you. And that very low-cost insurance, sort of the equivalent of the bare-bones insurance you have to get for driving, but when you get in an accident, it turns out, doesn't do anything to fix your car, but obviously, much more is at stake here.\nWe still have debates today where people will say, you know, people's—aren't having the choices that they used to have. Well, the choices, in some cases, that they used to have were choices to get insurance that weren't going to cover them during a catastrophe.\nSo I think that the way I would like to see us operate—and we're not there at the moment, and it will never be perfect—is, yes, significant debate, contentious debate, but where we are still operating on the same basic platform, basic rules about how do we determine what's true and what's not. And one of the ironies, I think, of the Internet has been the degree to which it's bringing us unprecedented knowledge, but everything on the Internet looks like it might be true. [Laughter] And so in this political season, we've seen just—you just say stuff. [Laughter] And so everything suddenly becomes contested. That I do not think is good for our democracy, and it's certainly not good for science or progress or government or fixing systems. We've got to be able to agree on certain baseline facts.\nIf you want to argue with me about how to deal with climate change, that's a legitimate argument. Some people might argue it's unrealistic to think that we're going to be able to fix this so we should just start adapting to the oceans being 6 feet higher. You might want to suggest to me that it's got to be a market-based solution and it's all going to come through innovation, regulation is not going to help, we need a huge—I'm happy to have those arguments. But what you can't do is argue with me that we've had over the last 10, 15 years, each year is the hottest year ever, or that the glaciers are melting and Greenland is melting. You can't argue with me about that because I can see it, and we're recording it.\nAnd in the same way around health, I think any good scientist or doctor would not presume to suggest that the sum total of our knowledge is all contained in our current medical schools, and there may be holistic medicines or alternative medicines that are remarkable, but we also should be able to test them. And you can't just assert that this works and more conventional therapies don't work and not be subject to that kind of testing regimen.\nSo that's where I think we have to move our conversation generally if we're going to have the kind of debate that Kaf talked about.\nAccuracy of Online Information/News Media/Scientific Research\nDr. Gawande. So how do we move our conversation in that way, right? There was a time when scientists were arguing about climate change and reasonably so.\nThe President. Right.\nDr. Gawande. So how do we set up frameworks where we say, this is our time period where we're going to collect facts, and at the end of the day, we will accept the consensus of fact? Right? How do we do that in our current political enterprise?\nThe President. If I had the perfect answer to that, then I'd run for President. [Laughter] No, I just—look, this takes us a little bit far afield, but I do think that it's relevant to the scientific community, it's relevant to our democracy, citizenship. We're going to have to rebuild, within this Wild, Wild West of information flow, some sort of curating function that people agree to.\nI use the analogy in politics: It used to be, there were three television stations and Walter Cronkite is on there and not everybody agreed. And there were always outliers who thought that it was all propaganda and we didn't really land on the Moon and Elvis is still alive and so forth. [Laughter] But generally, that was in the papers that you bought at the supermarket right as you were checking out. And generally, people trusted a basic body of information.\nIt wasn't always as democratic as it should have been. And Zoë is exactly right that, for example, on something like climate change, we've actually been doing some interesting initiatives where we're essentially deputizing citizens with hand-held technologies to start recording information that then gets pooled. They're becoming scientists without getting the Ph.D. And we can do that in a lot of other fields as well.\nBut there has to be, I think, some sort of way in which we can sort through information that passes some basic truthiness tests—[laughter]—and those that we have to discard because they just don't have any basis in anything that's actually happening in the world.\nAnd that's hard to do, but I think it's going to be necessary, it's going to be possible. I think the answer is obviously not censorship, but it's creating places where people can say, this is reliable and I'm still able to argue about—safely, about facts and what we should do about it while still not just making stuff up.\nTechnological Innovation/Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math Education/Distinction Between Government and Private Sector\nDr. Gawande. I think you're focusing on the idea of places where the scientific orientation can be that ethos is protected is really important. Science is always probable knowledge. It's never nailed down. But we're at CMU, we're at University of Pittsburgh, because they are places that hold those values of a scientific orientation. There are places that live like that online, in patient communities. There are places that are professional societies that make it happen. It's crucial that it also happen in government and it also happen in the private sector. And I guess my final question would be, for any and all of us, what's the most important thing we can make sure that we do to keep that scientific orientation, that optimism, and that striving for the big opportunity going? That we can keep these values as part of the places where we are, whether they're in the virtual world or in our institutions. And maybe, I'll let you have the last word, so I'll start on that end, if that's okay, Zoë.\nMs. Keating. Well, I really feel like this—it's just this huge opportunity and this way for, if people feel like they can contribute, that then they will trust things. They will trust institutions, they will trust governments, if they feel that they have a voice. And it's our job to figure out how can we make this thing the President was talking about—how can we make the system that allows people to contribute, but it's somehow vetted so that all that knowledge can be shared, because we need all hands on deck. So—[laughter].\nDr. Gawande. And a chance for people to participate in the science itself.\nMs. Keating. Yes, a chance for people to participate. And that goes—that's beyond health care, that's across the board. And I feel like that's a huge challenge for our time. Right now, just how can we do that so that we can really—because we need everybody's help in everything that's coming for us.\nDr. Gawande. Riccardo.\nMr. Sabatini. Yes, the one thing that—the fight is a little bit unfair because magic has always answers, the bogus things that you find around. There's always strong answers. There is the cure of cancer, but it's closed in a closet somewhere. While science cannot state those strong answers, because it's a constantly evolving field, and it wouldn't be fair.\nBut we have a cool story that sometimes we don't say enough. When we describe how the brain works, when we describe the majesty of what it means watching inside your genes and how the proteins flow, and the molecules, and when I explain these stories and I make them human, and I explain cases—stories of patients and people that access their health and they really got incredible advancements on that. When we nail the story right, then we engage the young people, the vast majority of the population.\nWe tend to fight these bogus messages. But on one side, it means we are failing. We are failing to tell the amazing advancements that we are doing in the right stories, beating fake stories with great realities. And this is a challenge that we have to do. And I'm engaging as much as possible, explaining the excitement that there is in the time in history when we have access to things that we were never even dreaming 15 years ago.\nThis is the story that we have to tell outside these doors. You are some of the smartest people in this country. You have to be advocates of how amazing things we're doing, without giving strong solutions, but—and fake results, but telling that there are the best people chasing this dream and we're going to crack it. It is our duty, making people feel confident that this is the right story to follow.\nDr. Dzirasa. Yes, I'm honored that you chose to sit on this panel, because I think health is the real truth teller and the real equalizer. When you think about this country, by 2050, we'll be spending about a trillion dollars a year on Alzheimer's. If, Lord willing, we get over 85, half of us will have Alzheimer's. One out of every 48 boys in this country are born with autism now. And so it's the real truth teller. Right? It is the real common enemy that all of us, as Americans, as scientists, as educators have. Right? And the reason I'm optimistic is because I fundamentally believe there is a 7-year-old sitting in a classroom somewhere that will take all of these investments and all of this work that we've made and transform things for my family. Right? The challenge for me is that I would love to see an America in which, whether that 7-year-old kid is sitting in a school in Detroit or Baltimore or Gentry High School in the Mississippi Delta, that they will also have the opportunity for their ideas to bubble up and be nurtured. Because, at the end of the day, that—the solution to that common enemy that we all face might be sitting in that classroom right now.\nThe President. That's great. Well, I'm going to steal some ideas from what my other panelists have already said.\nFirst of all, Zoë's point about opening up systems so that people understand them and don't just feel like cogs in that system, but rather, have agency in that system, I think, is critically important.\nSo what we've been trying to do across the board—and we're not even close to being there yet—is to use technology as a way to do exactly what you are talking about. Whether it's releasing big data—and the easiest example, I think, for the general public to think about is all the apps that now give us the weather over our phones, and those are all generated from inside government, but it—what used to be closed data now we let out there. Well, it turns out that we've got huge data sets on all kinds of stuff. And the more we're opening that up and allowing businesses, individuals, to work with that information, I think, the more they feel empowered. And that makes a huge difference.\nThe second thing that I want to emphasize is, the most important curator to be able to sort through what's true and false and sustain that—those scientific values you talk about is the human brain, and making sure that our kids are getting that ability to analyze and do that sorting early. And so part of the reason why we've been emphasizing STEM education is not because we don't value the humanities—and I was a political science and English major, and I've probably learned more from reading novels than textbooks—but it's—what it does do is, it helps everyone as citizens, even if you don't become a doctor or a scientist or a physicist, it helps you evaluate information in a way that allows you to make good decisions in your own life, but also allows you to participate in the country as a whole.\nAnd so we want everybody—we're putting a special emphasis on girls, young people of color, who so often are underrepresented in the STEM fields—we want to make sure they feel a confidence about so much of the technology and information revolution and science that is transforming their lives all around them. And we want them to be creators of science, not just consumers of it. So I think that's very important.\nThe final thing I'll say is that government will never run the way Silicon Valley runs because, by definition, democracy is messy. This is a big, diverse country with a lot of interests and a lot of disparate points of view. And part of government's job, by the way, is dealing with problems that nobody else wants to deal with.\nSo sometimes, I talk to CEOs, they come in and they start, kind of, telling me about leadership, and here's how we do things. [Laughter]. And I say, well, if all I was doing was making a widget—[laughter]—or producing an app, and I didn't have to worry about whether poor people could afford the widget, or I didn't have to worry about whether the app had some unintended consequences—setting aside my Syria and Yemen portfolio—[laughter]—then I\nthink those suggestions are terrific. [Laughter] But if—which isn't the—that's not, by the way, to say that there aren't huge efficiencies and improvements that have to be made.\nBut the reason I say this is, sometimes you get, I think—in the scientific community, the tech community, the entrepreneurial community—the sense of we just have to blow up the system or create this parallel society and culture because Government is inherently wrecked. No, it's not inherently wrecked; it's just Government has to care for, for example, veterans who come home. That's not on your balance sheet, that's on our collective balance sheet, because we have a sacred duty to take care of those veterans. And that's hard, and it's messy, and we're building off legacy systems that we can't just blow up.\nWe've been pushing very hard in the area of medicine to have the FDA reimagine how it does regulations in the genetic space so that it's different from how they might deal with a mechanical prosthetic. But I don't want to just blow up the FDA, because part of Government's job is to make sure that snake oil and stuff that could hurt you isn't out on—out there on the market being advertised on a daily basis.\nSo there are going to be some inherent balances that have to be taken in, and there are equities that are complicated in Government. And I guess the reason I'm saying this is, I don't want this audience of people who are accustomed to things happening faster and smoother in their narrow fields to somehow get discouraged and say, I'm just not going to deal with Government. Because, at the end of the day, if you're not willing to do what Kaf said earlier, which is just get in the arena and wrestle with this stuff and argue with people who may not agree with you and tolerate sometimes not perfect outcomes, but better outcomes, then the space to continue scientific progress isn't going to be there.\nAnd what gives me confidence is that I've met a lot of people as President of the United States, and the American people fundamentally are good, they're decent, and they're smart, and they just don't have time to follow everything. The more we empower them, the more we bring them in and include them, I have no doubt that we're going to be able to make enormous strides. And the audience here, I think, is representative of the amazing possibilities that we confront. All right?\nDr. Gawande. Well, let's thank the panel. And I'd also like to thank the President for having the Frontiers Conference. I think you have set an expectation which can apply to any President in the future of any party that you can be a President for science and health and that we can live up to those values.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "This Executive order was published in the  Federal Register  on October 18.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119508", "text": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and to prepare the Nation for space weather events, it is hereby ordered as follows:\nSection 1. Policy. Space weather events, in the form of solar flares, solar energetic particles, and geomagnetic disturbances, occur regularly, some with measurable effects on critical infrastructure systems and technologies, such as the Global Positioning System (GPS), satellite operations and communication, aviation, and the electrical power grid. Extreme space weather events—those that could significantly degrade critical infrastructure—could disable large portions of the electrical power grid, resulting in cascading failures that would affect key services such as water supply, healthcare, and transportation. Space weather has the potential to simultaneously affect and disrupt health and safety across entire continents. Successfully preparing for space weather events is an all-of-nation endeavor that requires partnerships across governments, emergency managers, academia, the media, the insurance industry, non-profits, and the private sector.\nIt is the policy of the United States to prepare for space weather events to minimize the extent of economic loss and human hardship. The Federal Government must have (1) the capability to predict and detect a space weather event, (2) the plans and programs necessary to alert the public and private sectors to enable mitigating actions for an impending space weather event, (3) the protection and mitigation plans, protocols, and standards required to reduce risks to critical infrastructure prior to and during a credible threat, and (4) the ability to respond to and recover from the effects of space weather. Executive departments and agencies (agencies) must coordinate their efforts to prepare for the effects of space weather events.\nSec. 2. Objectives. This order defines agency roles and responsibilities and directs agencies to take specific actions to prepare the Nation for the hazardous effects of space weather. These activities are to be implemented in conjunction with those identified in the 2015 National Space Weather Action Plan (Action Plan) and any subsequent updates. Implementing this order and the Action Plan will require the Federal Government to work across agencies and to develop, as appropriate, enhanced and innovative partnerships with State, tribal, and local governments; academia; non-profits; the private sector; and international partners. These efforts will enhance national preparedness and speed the creation of a space-weather-ready Nation.\nSec. 3. Coordination. (a) The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), in consultation with the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), shall coordinate the development and implementation of Federal Government activities to prepare the Nation for space weather events, including the activities established in section 5 of this order and the recommendations of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC), established by Executive Order 12881 of November 23, 1993 (Establishment of the National Science and Technology Council). (b) To ensure accountability for and coordination of research, development, and implementation of activities identified in this order and in the Action Plan, the NSTC shall establish a Space Weather Operations, Research, and Mitigation Subcommittee (Subcommittee). The Subcommittee member agencies shall conduct activities to advance the implementation of this order, to achieve the goals identified in the 2015 National Space Weather Strategy and any subsequent updates, and to coordinate and monitor the implementation of the activities specified in the Action Plan and provide subsequent updates.\nSec. 4. Roles and Responsibilities. To the extent permitted by law, the agencies below shall adopt the following roles and responsibilities, which are key to ensuring enhanced space weather forecasting, situational awareness, space weather preparedness, and continuous Federal Government operations during and after space weather events.\n(a) The Secretary of Defense shall ensure the timely provision of operational space weather observations, analyses, forecasts, and other products to support the mission of the Department of Defense and coalition partners, including the provision of alerts and warnings for space weather phenomena that may affect weapons systems, military operations, or the defense of the United States.\n(b) The Secretary of the Interior shall support the research, development, deployment, and operation of capabilities that enhance the understanding of variations of the Earth's magnetic field associated with solar-terrestrial interactions.\n(c) The Secretary of Commerce shall:\n(i) provide timely and accurate operational space weather forecasts, watches, warnings, alerts, and real-time space weather monitoring for the government, civilian, and commercial sectors, exclusive of the responsibilities of the Secretary of Defense; and\n(ii) ensure the continuous improvement of operational space weather services, utilizing partnerships, as appropriate, with the research community, including academia and the private sector, and relevant agencies to develop, validate, test, and transition space weather observation platforms and models from research to operations and from operations to research.\n(d) The Secretary of Energy shall facilitate the protection and restoration of the reliability of the electrical power grid during a presidentially declared grid security emergency associated with a geomagnetic disturbance pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 824o-1.\n(e) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall:\n(i) ensure the timely redistribution of space weather alerts and warnings that support national preparedness, continuity of government, and continuity of operations; and\n(ii) coordinate response and recovery from the effects of space weather events on critical infrastructure and the broader community.\n(f) The Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) shall:\n(i) implement and support a national research program to understand the Sun and its interactions with Earth and the solar system to advance space weather modeling and prediction capabilities applicable to space weather forecasting;\n(ii) develop and operate space-weather-related research missions, instrument capabilities, and models; and\n(iii) support the transition of space weather models and technology from research to operations and from operations to research.\n(g) The Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) shall support fundamental research linked to societal needs for space weather information through investments and partnerships, as appropriate.\n(h) The Secretary of State, in consultation with the heads of relevant agencies, shall carry out diplomatic and public diplomacy efforts to strengthen global capacity to respond to space weather events.\n(i) The Secretaries of Defense, the Interior, Commerce, Transportation, Energy, and Homeland Security, along with the Administrator of NASA and the Director of NSF, shall work together, consistent with their ongoing activities, to develop models, observation systems, technologies, and approaches that inform and enhance national preparedness for the effects of space weather events, including how space weather events may affect critical infrastructure and change the threat landscape with respect to other hazards.\n(j) The heads of all agencies that support National Essential Functions, defined by Presidential Policy Directive 40 (PPD-40) of July 15, 2016 (National Continuity Policy), shall ensure that space weather events are adequately addressed in their all-hazards preparedness planning, including mitigation, response, and recovery, as directed by PPD-8 of March 30, 2011 (National Preparedness).\n(k) NSTC member agencies shall coordinate through the NSTC to establish roles and responsibilities beyond those identified in section 4 of this order to enhance space weather preparedness, consistent with each agency's legal authority.\nSec. 5. Implementation. (a) Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall develop a plan to test and evaluate available devices that mitigate the effects of geomagnetic disturbances on the electrical power grid through the development of a pilot program that deploys such devices, in situ, in the electrical power grid. After the development of the plan, the Secretary shall implement the plan in collaboration with industry. In taking action pursuant to this subsection, the Secretaries of Energy and Homeland Security shall consult with the Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.\n(b) Within 120 days of the date of this order, the heads of the sector-specific agencies that oversee the lifeline critical infrastructure functions as defined by the National Infrastructure Protection Plan of 2013—including communications, energy, transportation, and water and wastewater systems—as well as the Nuclear Reactors, Materials, and Waste Sector, shall assess their executive and statutory authority, and limits of that authority, to direct, suspend, or control critical infrastructure operations, functions, and services before, during, and after a space weather event. The heads of each sector-specific agency shall provide a summary of these assessments to the Subcommittee.\n(c) Within 90 days of receipt of the assessments ordered in section 5(b) of this order, the Subcommittee shall provide a report on the findings of these assessments with recommendations to the Director of OSTP, the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, and the Director of OMB. The assessments may be used to\ninform the development and implementation of policy establishing authorities and responsibilities for agencies in response to a space weather event.\n(d) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretaries of Defense and Commerce, the Administrator of NASA, and the Director of NSF, in collaboration with other agencies as appropriate, shall identify mechanisms for advancing space weather observations, models, and predictions, and for sustaining and transitioning appropriate capabilities from research to operations and operations to research, collaborating with industry and academia to the extent possible.\n(e) Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretaries of Defense and Commerce shall make historical data from the GPS constellation and other U.S. Government satellites publicly available, in accordance with Executive Order 13642 of May 9, 2013 (Making Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information), to enhance model validation and improvements in space weather forecasting and situational awareness.\n(f) Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security, through the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and in coordination with relevant agencies, shall lead the development of a coordinated Federal operating concept and associated checklist to coordinate Federal assets and activities to respond to notification of, and protect against, impending space weather events. Within 180 days of the publication of the operating concept and checklist, agencies shall develop operational plans documenting their procedures and responsibilities to prepare for, protect against, and mitigate the effects of impending space weather events, in support of the Federal operating concept and compatible with the National Preparedness System described in PPD-8.\nSec. 6. Stakeholder Engagement. The agencies identified in this order shall seek public-private and international collaborations to enhance observation networks, conduct research, develop prediction models and mitigation approaches, enhance community resilience and preparedness, and supply the services necessary to protect life and property and promote economic prosperity, as consistent with law.\nSec. 7. Definitions. As used in this order:\n(a) \"Prepare\" and \"preparedness\" have the same meaning they have in PPD-8. They refer to the actions taken to plan, organize, equip, train, and exercise to build and sustain the capabilities necessary to prevent, protect against, mitigate the effects of, respond to, and recover from those threats that pose the greatest risk to the security of the Nation. This includes the prediction and notification of space weather events.\n(b) \"Space weather\" means variations in the space environment between the Sun and Earth (and throughout the solar system) that can affect technologies in space and on Earth. The primary types of space weather events are solar flares, solar energetic particles, and geomagnetic disturbances.\n(c) \"Solar flare\" means a brief eruption of intense energy on or near the Sun's surface that is typically associated with sunspots.\n(d) \"Solar energetic particles\" means ions and electrons ejected from the Sun that are typically associated with solar eruptions.\n(e) \"Geomagnetic disturbance\" means a temporary disturbance of Earth's magnetic field resulting from solar activity. (f) \"Critical infrastructure\" has the meaning provided in section 1016(e) of the USA Patriot Act of 2001 (42 U.S.C. 5195c(e)), namely systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.\n(g) \"Sector-Specific Agency\" means the agencies designated under PPD-21 of February 12, 2013 (Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience), or any successor directive, to be responsible for providing institutional knowledge and specialized expertise as well as leading, facilitating, or supporting the security and resilience programs and associated activities of its designated critical infrastructure sector in the all-hazards environment.\nSec. 8. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of OMB relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nBARACK OBAMA\nThe White House,\nOctober 13, 2016.", "timestamp": "2016-10-13", "title": "Executive Order 13744—Coordinating Efforts To Prepare the Nation for Space Weather Events"}

Hello, Democrats! O-H!\nAudience members. I-O!\nThe President. O-H!\nAudience members. I-O!\nThe President. O-H!\nAudience members. I-O!\nThe President. Oh, it is good to see you all! Thank you. I'm just warming you up. [Laughter] Because I know the Buckeyes have a big showdown at Wisconsin on Saturday night.\nThank you so much, everybody. Please have a seat. I have—I'm going to talk to you for a while, now. [Laughter] Tonight we're here to talk about the showdown that's happening right here in Ohio over the next few weeks. And of course, it would not be an Ohio Democratic Party State Dinner without your former Governor and your next United States Senator, Ted Strickland. Love this man. Your current Senator, who is fighting for you every single day, Sherrod Brown. A couple of your outstanding Members of Congress, Joyce Beatty and Tim Ryan.\nNow, I know the Ohio Democratic Party has been preparing for this election. You know a strong party depends on great public servants being elected at the local level and the school boards and the city councils and the mayor's office. And your field operation has helped us win important races from Akron to Toledo, from Chillicothe to Warren. And through the spring, even as we Democrats had a hard-fought primary, you kept signing up thousands of volunteers, registering thousands of voters, organizing on campuses all across the State. You were already looking to the fall campaign. So we are going to benefit big time from the infrastructure that you've already got in place.\nSo I just want to say thank you for giving us the edge that we need. Thanks for organizing. Thanks for mobilizing. Thanks for not getting tired. Thanks for still being fired up and still being ready to go. Because right now is when the fruits of all that labor are going to start paying off. It is game time. Kickoff was yesterday. Early voting started yesterday. The game does not start on November 8, the game ends on November 8.\nSo, everybody here, enjoy your dinner. [Laughter] Everybody looks cute. [Laughter] But tomorrow you've got to put on those walking shoes. You've got to start making those calls and knocking on doors, getting everybody out to vote early. That's how we won in 2008. That's how we're going to win in 2016.\nBecause, let's face it, let's face it, Ohio is always close. I don't know what it is about you guys. [Laughter] Just making me stressed. I've always got to watch the TV—what's going to happen in Ohio? [Laughter] I mean, I pretty much parked here in the final days of both of my campaigns. In 2008, I was here in Columbus 2 days before election day. In 2012, I was here the day before election day. And it makes me think about how far we've come together, not just the fact that I had no gray hair in those pictures. [Laughter]\nThink about the road we've traveled. Together, we fought our way back from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Our businesses have now turned job losses into 15 million new jobs. We turned around an auto industry that Ohio communities depend on, and our automakers are making the best cars in the world and they are selling more than ever, thanks to outstanding UAW workers who take great pride in what they do.\nWe slashed our dependence on foreign oil. Folks don't even notice gas prices being cheap anymore. [Laughter] We more than doubled our production of renewable energy. We've got incomes rising again, rose faster last year than any time on record, all demographic groups. Poverty fell last year by the largest amount since 1968, since I was 7 years old. The uninsured rate is at an alltime low; 20 million people have health insurance that didn't have it before, including folks right here in the great State Ohio.\nWe brought more of our brave troops home to their families. We delivered justice to bin Laden. And in today's America, wherever you live, you can marry whoever you love.\nWe've been busy. [Laughter] We brought about change that's made a difference in the lives of people all across this country. There's almost no economic measure by which we are not substantially better off today than we were when I came into office.\nThat's what the hard work and the determination of the American people can do. That's what strong, principled Democratic leadership can do. That's what a President who has your back and is listening to you and cares about you can do. And that's what great Members of Congress and a Democratic majority in Congress can do. And that's why we've got to elect Hillary Clinton as the next President of the United States. That's why we've got to elect Ted Strickland to be the next great Senator from Ohio.\nI will not be on the ballot, but everything we've done is going to be on the ballot.\n[At this point, there was a disruption in the audience.]\nOh, Lord, what's going on now? Who's hollering? I can't even see you. Well, it's great to see you, but I've got all these folks I've got to talk to. [Laughter] Maybe you can get me a note. [Laughter] Write me a letter, all right?\n[The disruption continued.]\nOkay, I've got you. Okay, thank you. [Laughter] I can't hear you that well. I promise you this will go better if you talk to one of my staff up there. I've got you, okay. All right. Thank you.\nAudience member. No more pipeline! [Inaudible] No more Dakota Access Pipeline!\nThe President. Okay, I've heard you. Let me now talk to everybody else. Thank you. I love you. All right. Thank you.\nThank you. Thank you. I mean, I'm getting old so I can't hear that well—[laughter]—I can't see that good. [Laughter]\n[The disruption continued.]\nI've got you. [Laughter] Where was I? [Laughter] All right. So look, I'm not going to be on the ballot, but all the progress that we've made, all that stuff goes out the window if we don't work as hard as we can to win this election. And I've seen what hard work looks like here in Ohio. I've seen it. I've benefited from it. I got elected by it. And now Hillary and Ted and everybody—every Democrat up and down the ballot has got to do the same.\nYes, I know that folks say this every 4 years, but this time it's really true—[laughter]—I cannot think of a more important election in our lifetimes. Because the choice between candidates has never been this stark.\nI mean, it's a choice between somebody who is as qualified as has ever been to run for this office, somebody who's, over and over, proven that they've—know how to lead and know how to work and understand the issues that working families are facing. That's on the one hand. And then, on the other hand, you've got a—somebody who, each and every day, every time he talks, proves himself unfit and unqualified for this office.\nAnd I don't need to spend a huge amount of time selling this crowd on Hillary. If you want to hear the best case for Hillary Clinton, if you want to hear the very real stakes in this election, I would advise you to link up to Michelle's speech from earlier today in New Hampshire. She was pretty good. [Laughter] I mean, she—that's why you get married, to improve your gene pool. [Laughter] So your kids end up being superior to you.\nSo I don't need to sell you on Hillary. And I don't need to sell you on Ted. You guys know her, know him, have seen the track record that they have put together. But I'm going to go ahead and say some nice things about Ted anyway because he's here. [Laughter]\nYou know, I could not be prouder to call Ted a friend. He was a great Congressman for the people of Southeast Ohio. He was a great Governor for everybody in Ohio. He was a great campaign cochair for me in 2012. And there's a reason that Ted has always put working families first, because in those families, he sees his own families. He knows what it's like to struggle. He knows their hopes and their dreams.\nHe's the son of a steelworker. He's the first in his family to go to college. He's a minister who doesn't just talk the talk, but lives out his faith, and a public servant who puts his values into action.\nSo when he was in Congress, he fought to pass the Children's Health Insurance Program—working alongside Hillary—something that still helps millions of children today. As Governor, he froze public college tuition; made it free for Ohio veterans, which helped more young people succeed. And even though he took office as your Governor about a year before the recession hit, by the time he left, Ohio was the fifth fastest growing economy in America.\nTed delivered, and when it mattered most, he had your back. So on issue after issue, Ohio voters have a clear choice in this election: between somebody who sides with Ohio's working families, and somebody who sides with the special interests who want to block all of our progress.\nSo if you care about workers' rights, then the choice is pretty clear. Ted believes we should protect overtime pay so folks get paid what they've earned; that workers should have the right to bargain for better pay and better benefits. His opponent helped strip overtime from 6 million workers, backed a bill that would make it harder for workers to organize.\nIf you care about higher wages, the choice should be pretty simple. Ted believes that, in 2016, women should get equal pay for equal work. His opponent has voted against equal pay five times. When it comes to the minimum wage, in 2015 I told Members of Congress if they truly believed they could work full time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, they should try it. And if not, they should vote to give America a raise.\nTed actually tried it for a full week. He actually did it, walked in a minimum wage worker's shoes. Understood how hard it was. Understood the reality of a single mom who's working full time and, at the end of the day, still doesn't have enough to keep a roof over her child's head or make sure that they get a good meal. That's why Ted keeps fighting to raise the minimum wage. And his opponent has voted against it again and again and again. So that's the choice in this election.\nIf you care about keeping our cops and our kids safe, you've got a choice. Ted Strickland supports commonsense gun safety measures like background checks, keeping assault weapons out of the hands of terrorists. Shouldn't be controversial. His opponent blocked background checks and opposed a bill to stop people on the terror watch list from buying a gun. That's why, as of last month, the NRA has spent more money against Ted Strickland than on all the other House and Senate races combined. Think about that.\nIf you care about our justice system and our most fundamental rights, then you've got a choice. Ted thinks we should have a full Supreme Court. That's—that didn't used to be a controversial position. Apparently, it is now. His opponent has helped to deny a simple yes-or-no vote to somebody who almost everybody agrees may be the most highly qualified nominee in history. Why? Does he think President Trump should fill the seat with somebody instead?\nAudience member. No!\nThe President. Does he have confidence that that would go well? [Laughter] Which brings me to another fairly substantial difference. Unlike his opponent, Ted Strickland has never supported Donald Trump. Hasn't done it.\nNow, I understand that Ted's opponent has finally withdrawn his support from Donald Trump—after looking at the polling, now that it's politically expedient. But he supported him up until last week. So I guess it was okay when Trump was attacking minorities and suggesting that Mexicans were rapists and Muslims were unpatriotic and insulting Gold Star moms and making fun of disabled Americans. I guess that didn't quite tip it over the edge. [Laughter] Why was that okay?\nAnd now he says he'll vote for the Vice Presidential nominee instead, except that guy still supports Donald Trump. [Laughter] Does anybody really think that Ted's opponent is going to be a check on a Trump Presidency? Are we really going to risk giving Donald Trump the congressional majority he'd need to roll back all the progress that we've made over the past 8 years?\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. Look, we know that most Republicans don't think the way Donald Trump does. Even in a banquet like this, full of hardcore Democrats. We have Republican friends, we've got Republican neighbors, we—at the Little League game, soccer game, parent-teacher's conference, we meet them. Some great people. We don't even think that most Republican politicians actually really believe that Donald Trump is qualified to be President. [Laughter] I know because they—I talk to them. [Laughter] They're all, like, man, this is really bad. [Laughter] We're just trying to get through this. [Laughter] But so the problem is not that all Republicans think the way this guy does. The problem is, is that they've been riding this tiger for a long time. They've been feeding their base all kinds of crazy for years, primarily for political expedience. So if Trump was running around saying I wasn't born here, they were okay with that as long as it helped them with votes. If some of these folks on talk radio started talking about how I was the antichrist, well, you know, it's just politics. [Laughter] You think I'm joking. [Laughter]\nIf somebody completely denies climate change or is filled up with all kinds of conspiracy theories about how me and Hillary started ISIL. [Laughter] Or that we were plotting to declare martial law and take away everybody's guns. And we did a military exercise—Pentagon does these periodically—in Texas, and suddenly, all the folks in Texas were all, like, they're going to take over right now! [Laughter] I'm serious. And then, the Senator down there said, yes, we better look into that. [Laughter] And the Governor says, well, I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? [Laughter] What does that mean? Are—really? You think that, like, the entire Pentagon said, oh, really, you want to declare martial law and take over Texas? Let's do it under the guise of routine training missions—[laughter]—and everybody is going to be—but they took it seriously.\nThis is in the swamp of crazy—[laughter]—that has been fed over and over and over and over again. And look, I—and it's—there's sort of a spectrum, right? It's a whole kind of ecosystem. So—and look, if I watched Fox News I wouldn't vote for me. [Laughter] I understand. If I was listening to Rush Limbaugh, I'd say, man, this is terrible. [Laughter] Fortunately, I have a more diverse sources of information.\nBut—and I want to make a serious point here, because I'm not really—I'm really not exaggerating. Everything I'm saying are actual things that have been said and that people—a fairly sizable number of people in the Republican primaries believe. And the people who knew better didn't say anything. They didn't say, well, you know what, I disagree with his economic policies, but that's too—that goes too far. They didn't say, well, I'm not sure his foreign policy is the right one for America, but we can't allow our politics to descend into the gutter.\nPeople like Ted's opponent, they stood by while this happened. And Donald Trump, as he's prone to do, he didn't build the building himself, but he just slapped his name on it and took credit for it.\nAnd that's what's happened in their party. All that bile, all the exaggeration, all the stuff that was not grounded in fact just kind of bubbled up, started surfacing. They know better, a lot of these folks who ran, and they didn't say anything. And so they don't get credit for, at the very last minute, when finally the guy that they nominated and they endorsed and they supported is caught on tape saying things that no decent person would even think, much less say, much less brag about, much less laugh about or joke about, much less act on. You can't wait until that finally happens and then say, \"Oh, that's too much, that's enough,\" and think that somehow you are showing any kind of leadership and deserve to be elected to the United States Senate.\nYou don't get points for that. In fact, I'm more forgiving of the people who actually believe it—[laughter]—than the people who know better and stood silently by out of political expediency, because it was politically convenient.\nAnd if your only organizing principle has been to block progress and block what we've tried to do to help the American people every step of the way, so you're not even consistent anymore—you claim the mantle of the party of family values, and this is the guy you nominate? And stand by and endorse and campaign with until, finally, at the 11th hour, you withdraw your nomination? You don't get credit for that.\nYou're the party that is tough on foreign policy and opposes Russia, and then you nominate this guy, whose role model is Vladimir Putin, the former head of the KGB? [Laughter] I'm sorry, what happened? [Laughter] It's disappointing. It really is. Because, yes, I'm a Democrat, but I'm an American first. And I actually believe in a strong two-party system. And I think that the marketplace of ideas should have a reasonable, commonsense Republican Party debating a reasonable, commonsense Democratic Party. But that is not what we have right now.\nAnd the reason is, is because people like Ted's opponents, who know better, have stood silently by. They've been trying to block everything we've tried to do to help working folks for years now. Even here in the State of Ohio, they opposed us trying to save the auto industry on—upon which hundreds of thousands of jobs depend. And then, when it works out pretty good, you're taking credit for it. Man, look at this economy, it's gone great. [Laughter] Yes. [Laughter] But you sure didn't help. [Laughter] It wasn't because of your policies. That's not why Ohio grew. That's not why folks got back to work.\nIf—so the point is, if your only agenda is either negative—negative's a euphemism—crazy—[laughter]—based on lies, based on hoaxes, this is the nominee you get. You make him possible.\nNow they're shocked. It's like, remember that movie—in \"Casablanca?\" Guy walks in, shocked that there's gambling in this establishment. [Laughter] Young people may not understand that reference. [Laughter] Go back, watch \"Casablanca.\" Great movie. Humphrey Bogart. [Laughter]\nSo Donald Trump may make most Republican politicians look a little bit better by comparison. I mean, it's like the bar has gotten so low. [Laughter] But these are the same Republicans who tried to block us from rescuing the economy, did not offer a single vote when it came to the recovery package that made sure that we started growing again, long before any other advanced economy did. Same folks who didn't vote for the auto industry assistance that resulted now in record-breaking auto sales. The same folks who tried to take away folks' health insurance every chance they get; who refuse to allow votes on giving minimum wage workers a raise; refuse to support making sure women earn equal pay for equal work. How hard a concept is that? Why would you want your daughter to get paid 80 cents for doing the same job that somebody else's son is getting paid a buck to do? That doesn't make any sense.\nSo don't act like this started with Donald Trump. I mean, he did take it to a whole new level. [Laughter] I got to give him credit. But he didn't come out of nowhere.\nAnd that's why we've got to win this election at every level. That's where you come in, Democrats. That's where your work will make a difference. That's where all the volunteer recruitment and the voter registration and the campus organizing comes into play. Because when Democrats have everybody on the field, we can't lose. And the other side knows that. That's why they're always trying to make it harder for folks to vote.\nWhich, by the way, that's a big difference between our parties. We're the only advanced democracy that has one party's central principle being, let's make it harder to vote. Doesn't happen other places. We don't think more voices participating in our democracy makes us weaker, just like we don't try to divide people by race or faith or orientation or gender. We believe we're stronger together, not divided. And if we keep speaking to America's hopes over their fears, and if we inspire them rather than divide them; if we have concrete plans to respond to the very real challenges that folks face with the same sense of urgency and compassion and empathy that we feel in our own families and our own communities; if we care about every kid the same way we want this country to care about our kids, then we'll win in November.\nI know that at times this has been a deeply dispiriting election year. And as I think back to 2008, or even 2012, and the sense of energy and hope that we felt, and I think about all the incredible work that we've done and the promises that we've delivered on, sometimes, you wonder, how did we get to the point where we have such rancor? And there are a lot of theories about it. People have real struggles in pockets of this country. Change is happening fast, sometimes faster than we feel like we can absorb. There's a constant stream of information coming at us, and so much of what attracts attention is the bad news instead of all the incredible things that are taking place in every corner of this great land.\nBut some of it, I think, really does just have to do with the fact that what's best in us has all too often stood on the sidelines and hasn't been heard and has left the field to some of our worst impulses.\nSo I want all of you to understand that when I reflect back on these 8 years, and I think about all the places I've been—all 50 States, towns and hamlets and big cities, suburbs and metropolises—and met people from all walks of life, on the factory floor, in classrooms, there's so much goodness in this country. There's so much decency in this country.\nThere's so much hard work going on in this country. There's so much ingenuity going on in this country. There's so much optimism in people's day-to-day lives and so much resilience. And we've just got to give expression to that.\nWe have to reflect our best selves. And that means even during political campaigns. We've got to show our kids the values that we want to pass on to them.\nAnd you know what, the Democratic Party is not perfect. I can say that even in a Democratic Party dinner. [Laughter] We have our own blind spots, and we have our own disagreements. We have interest groups that oftentimes are understandably thinking about their narrow slice of the issue. And sometimes, we contribute to, sort of, the lack of civility in our politics. And we don't always check ourselves. There are times where we're not consistent in what we expect from our own leadership versus others, that—times where we ignore inconvenient truths ourselves.\nBut what I'm really proud about, what I continue to fundamentally believe is that, at its core, the Democratic Party believes that everybody counts. The Democratic Party believes in ordinary working people being able, if they're working hard, to get ahead. The Democratic Party believes that we got to leave a country and a planet that's better than the one we inherited for the next generation. The Democratic Party believes that everybody has dignity and everybody has respect and everybody is worthy of consideration. And the Democratic Party believes that we're all in this together.\nAnd that's what we have to show for the next little less than 30 days. That's what we have to fight for. This isn't just about winning elections. It's also about affirming this democracy and affirming the basic idea that people who love their country can change it; that the most important office in this country is the office of citizen; that ordinary people, when they get together, can transform this Nation and can solve any problem and can overcome any obstacle and can heal any division.\nIf you believe that, if you don't just go through the motions this time, but if you really dig deep and think about what's best in us and what are we fighting for and how do we give expression to that—if you believe that—I guarantee you we will not just elect Ted Strickland as the next Senator from Ohio, we will not just elect Hillary Clinton to be the next President of the United States, but we will secure a brighter future for the greatest nation on Earth.\nAnd I'm going to be right there with you as a citizen of these United States. I'm going to work hard, and I'm going to organize, and I'm going to mobilize, and I'm going to make some phone calls, and I'm going to knock on some doors! And I want you along there with me. Because we got to keep this thing going. Because the journey is not done yet. Because I'm still fired up and I'm still ready to go!\nThank you, Ohio! God bless you. God bless the United States of America.", "timestamp": "2016-10-13", "title": "Remarks at a Fundraiser for Senatorial Candidate Theodore Strickland in Columbus, Ohio"}

SCHULTZ: Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome aboard Air Force One en route to Andrews Air Force Base. Before we get started, I just wanted to commend to your attention the presidential policy directive approved by the President today to solidify our policy with respect to Cuba.\nAs you all know, back in December of 2014, following more than 50 years of bad policy, the President announced that the United States would begin to normalize relations in Cuba. Since then, we've worked with the people and government of Cuba to do exactly that, reestablishing diplomatic relations, expanding travel, opening embassies, and launching initiatives to help our people cooperate and innovate. We're determined to keep moving that progress forward.\nThe directive released today cements the changes we've made, promotes transparency, and encourages further engagement between our countries and our people. Additionally, as I hope you saw, the Departments of Treasury and Commerce issued further regulatory changes today, building on the progress over the last two years. These changes are representative of the progress the President witnessed firsthand when he visited Havana to personally extend a hand of friendship to the Cuban people.\nHis interactions with everyday Cubans told a promising story of neighbors bound by common values working to build broader ties of cooperation between the Americas.\nWith that, I will take your questions on that or any other topic.\nQ: Eric, the President is meeting with his National Security Council this afternoon. Can you flesh out a little bit more about that meeting? Particularly, will the President be getting any kind of formal recommendations from his advisors on what to do next in Syria?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Sure. Josh, as we announced yesterday evening, the President will convene his National Security Council for a periodic review of his counter-ISIL campaign, as well as to discuss ongoing efforts to reduce violence, increase access for humanitarian aid, and advance a political transition in Syria.\nAs you know, the President does convene his National Security Council fairly regularly to, one, receive direct updates on how the counter-ISIL campaign is going, and two, to assess the progress we've made. So I expect the President to have that discussion with his team this afternoon. I think it's fair to say the President's top priority remains intensifying our military campaign against ISIL and al Qaeda, to protect the American people, our allies and partners.\nThe President will also receive an update on our efforts to work with local partners to pressure ISIL's two so-called capitals in Mosul and Raqqa.\nQ: But on Syria, we've kind of been in this holding pattern since the U.S. cut off diplomatic talks with Russia after the ceasefire failed. So is the President getting any closer to a decision about proceeding with some type of new action or strategy in Syria?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, Josh, I wouldn't anticipate any major announcements this afternoon. But what we will try and do is get you a written readout that summarizes the discussion.\nI think it's also worth noting that, in this context, Secretary Kerry will be traveling to Switzerland this weekend to meet with a number of key countries to discuss the multilateral approach to resolving the crisis in Syria. As you know, this is all consistent with the President's belief that the situation in Syria can only be resolved diplomatically.\nBoth in the meeting later this afternoon at the White House and in Secretary Kerry's engagements abroad, I think the President's goals will be front of mind, which are, one, stopping the violence, reducing the violence in Syria; two, providing expanded access for humanitarian aid; and three, building an environment conducive to a political transition inside Syria.\nQ: On hacks in general, Pence today said that it's more and more clear that the Russians seem to be trying to interfere with the election. And with the WikiLeaks hack recently of Podesta's emails, today it came out that in March of 2015 apparently the campaign was questioning if it should hold back emails between Secretary Clinton and the President. Do you have any comment on that?\nMR. SCHULTZ: As you know, it's longstanding tradition and practice in Washington that the President preserves the right to be able to communicate with his top advisors in real time as President. So what we've done is we have gone ahead and adopted a practice adopted by Presidents in both parties for decades now.\nSo I don't believe those emails will be released between the President and Secretary Clinton, but if you have questions about the tens of thousands of emails that have been released through the State Department process, you can talk to them about their process, and then Secretary Clinton about the contents of those emails.\nQ: But was there a discussion between the campaign and the White House to release these emails between the President and the Secretary?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Not that I'm aware of.\nQ: We just heard the President speak a little bit about Donald Trump making excuses for -- they seemed to pave the way for him not recognizing the result of the election. I was wondering how concerned is the White House by the prospect of him not recognizing the result of the election? And what consequences do you see if he does that, if he behaves like that?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Andrew, we've heard the President discuss repeatedly why we have confidence in our election systems. We also know that Russia has a history of trying to influence elections outside its borders. They've done this in Europe quite a bit. We know that as the intelligence community determined that recent hacks into the United States, into some political entities was done at the request of senior officials in Russia. But there's a number of reasons why we can have confidence in our election systems here.\nOne, the way our election systems are structured around the country -- they're on different systems. So different states have different ways of tracking ballots. And sometimes that even varies down to the local level. Two, none of those systems are connected to the Internet. And three, there is a lot of oversight and a lot of sort of belt and suspenders built into the process to safeguard the integrity of our election system.\nSo the President has a lot of confidence in our election system, and he believes that's well grounded.\nQ: My question wasn't really so much about the validity of Trump's plans, rather the fact of them. What impact does that have on the political climate in the United States? And what happens on November 9th should he not recognize the result, whether these claims are legitimate or not?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I see. Those claims don't seem to be coming from someone who would be on the cusp of winning.\nQ: On a somewhat related note, the President said democracy itself is on the ballot. That seems like it could be interpreted as kind of an apocalyptic type of claim. Does the President actually believe that if Donald Trump won, that democracy in the United States would be threatened?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, I think as the President explained in his remarks, all of the progress we've made over the past eight years is at stake, because there's a Republican nominee for President who doesn't have much of an agenda other than reversing the progress of the past eight years. So whether that's ensuring 20 million new Americans with health care; whether that's reviving the economy, creating the longest stretch of private sector job growth in our nation's history; creating new and renewable sources of energy; making housing more affordable, and making rising graduation rates higher than they've been in decades; educating young people in science and math and technology at rates that we haven't seen before; an international deal brokered thanks to the leadership of this President to reduce carbon pollution around the globe.\nSo, yes, the President does believe all of that is at stake.\nQ: But the democratic system itself, does he actually believe that's at stake? Does he actually believe that if Donald Trump won, that he doesn't believe in the democratic system and would try to undermine it in some way?\nMR. SCHULTZ: There are certain views that this nominee espouses that are contrary to democratic values. Whether that's his belief that his opponent should be thrown in jail, or whether that's restricting the rights of journalists, there are definitely views that this nominee continues to maintain that run contrary to values that many of us hold dear.\nQ: Related to Andrew's question, a number of weeks ago the White House acknowledged that the President's advisors were considering adding elections infrastructure to the critical infrastructure. Nothing has happened on that. And we've been hearing nothing will happen before the election. So can we just button that up, and can you confirm that's not going to happen before the election?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I want to quibble with that. It's not that nothing has happened. We've actually seen great engagements at the state and local level. We now have 33 states working with our Department of Homeland Security to make sure their election systems are of high caliber. So let me walk you through what that engagement means.\nQ: I really just want to know about the critical infrastructure designation.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, I know. But your question is about an important topic, so I want to make sure we explain where we are.\nThat support from DHS sort of boils down to three different buckets. One is, the assistance that these 33 states are getting includes very technical assistance and support like cyber scans, risk and vulnerability assessments, and sort of ongoing vigilance and monitoring to make sure that if there's any nefarious actors trying to interfere, that that's alerted very quickly.\nThe second way DHS has engaged on this is setting up an elections infrastructure cybersecurity working group. This brings together experts at all levels of the government, including local elected officials who are on the ground running these elections, running these ballots.\nAnd then the third is a commitment to the sharing and adopting best practices. So if we know that there's certain technology or certain practices that have been adopted in one state that have proven effective, then we can make sure that that is deployed to other states.\nQ: Can you give a response to Senator Warren's request to the President to fire the SEC chairwoman?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Todd, I saw that. I can tell you that the President continues to believe that Chair White is the right leader for the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC continues to have important regulatory and enforcement work to complete, and the Senate should confirm the President's nominees to the two open seats on the commission so they continue to work at full strength.\nSo let me just explain that over a year ago now, in October of 2015, the President nominated Lisa Fairfax and Hester Peirce to the SEC. The Senate has approved both of those nominations out of the committee, but they're still waiting for floor votes. So we believe that the Senate should hold a vote on those nominees as soon as they get back to Washington so that the SEC can proceed with full strength.\nQ: And can I ask you about the heckling the President has been subjected to the last two days? Does he take this in stride as part of the job? Does it irritate him? Does he think when somebody is shouting about the Dakota Access pipeline, does it give him second thoughts about the Dakota Access pipeline?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I think the President definitely takes it in stride as was evidenced by how he handled these events. And I think anyone who has followed this President knows that this isn't the first time and this isn't the last time that protestors want to make their voices heard at these events.\nQ: Eric, the President has made reference to the speech that his wife made yesterday, and it obviously made a lot of news. Can you give us any color on any interaction between them in relation to that speech?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, those are state secrets. But I can tell you that the President is very proud of his wife's remarks yesterday. I think it's important to sort of underscore the context by which she gave that extraordinary speech. As the President himself said, if you want to know the best case for electing Secretary Clinton president, that speech is what you should go check out.\nBut you'll note that earlier this week, the First Lady led a White House celebration on marking International Day of the Girl. And that also was a moment to revisit all of the work done in her Let Girls Learn initiative. That's been work that's been unfolding over the last eight years, and that includes visits around the world with amazing young women who have inspired the First Lady.\nQ: But did they talk about it last night? I mean, can you give us any sort of color about that?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I don't have any private conversations to read out to you. I will just say, though, that I think it was important that -- or I think it's important to note that when the First Lady meets these amazing young women around the world, she has the same message no matter where she is, which is they're valuable people. They should be treated with respect and dignity, and that the measure of a society is how it treats women and girls. And I think you heard yesterday why the First Lady believes those values are at stake in this election.\nQ: Eric, at what point do the accusations that you guys have made about the hack with Russia become an issue for the relationship with Russia? You guys have Secretary Kerry going to meet with Sergei Lavrov, who just the other day had that line about, there are pussies on both sides of the election, right? Like making clear where things are in his mind. Has it become an issue for how the administration and the President deal with Russia, Syria and other things?\nMR. SCHULTZ: The answer to the question is yes, Isaac. As you all know, our relationship with Russia is complicated. There are areas where we are able to work together, and then there's areas where we vehemently disagree.\nA few of the areas we work together include the deal to eliminate Iran's path to a nuclear weapon. That was a deal where, thanks to this President's leadership but with the cooperation of the Russian government, we were able to work to get the implemented. Another place where we work together is space exploration. Our two countries have a long history of working together to explore the new frontier.\nThere's also areas where we disagree. I would point you to Russia's nefarious activity in the Ukraine. I would point you to Russia's propping up of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, and I would point you to cyber activity. They have a long history of nefarious, and misguided, and unwise activity in cyberspace. And this is something that we raise at all levels with the Russian government. I don't have any responses to preview for you at this time. As we've said when we respond to these types of activities, we don't always announce -- we definitely don't announce them in advance, but we might not even be able to talk about them in real time because of the nature of the action.\nQ: Can the President trust Russia to be dealing with him fairly on anything, given that you guys are accusing Vladimir Putin and accusing the Russian government, essentially, of undermining American democracy, or attempting to, and doing it in a way that involves a lot of subterfuge?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, look, we haven't been shy about Russia's record in this space. Our own intelligence community issued a determination earlier this week -- I guess it was the end of last week now; it seems like much more longer ago -- determination that Russia was responsible for this. So we haven't been shy about that.\nWe've also been very clear about our concerns with their conduct in Syria, and that also speaks to their credibility, right? The reason the cessation of hostilities fell apart is because they weren't able to live up to commitments that they made. So this wasn't anything we imposed on them. These were commitments that they had agreed to that they couldn't even live up to.\nQ: But this is not a small claim here. And given what's being talked about just in Syria, you have the Secretary of State going to meet with a foreign minister who seems to have weighed in on this election in a government that you guys have accused of attempting to undermine American democracy. Do you really think that we can trust anything or deal fairly in any way with the Russians, given what the U.S. government has said?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well again, Russia, we know, has a long history of deploying these tactics in cyberspace that has not deterred us on working separately on issues where we think there's a mutual interest. So in other words --\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. SCHULTZ: But in other words, if there's areas where both countries can work together that advance our interests, we're not going to be shy about pursuing those.\nQ: Eric, you said that the issue of cyber is being raised with the Russians at every level. That's obviously you're talking about the broader issue. But this specific issue of targeting the elections, how have you raised this with the Russians? Did you send a demarche? Is the DNI going to Moscow? How are you delivering that message this time around?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I don't have any internal conversations to read out to you or how the United States government has been interacting with our Russian counterparts on this. But suffice it to say, they understand our views.\nQ: Eric, another one of the Podesta emails that came out has a private speech transcript of Clinton saying that if North Korea doesn't do what we want them -- sorry, if China doesn't do what we want them to do on North Korea, we'll encircle China with missile defense, which seems to pull the rug out under the administration's argument that our missile defense in that part of Asia is not directed at China.\nThis was shortly after she left the State Department. So is the U.S. concerned that China is not really going to buy our argument when Obama's former Secretary of State said these are directed at China?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Josh, I appreciate the question. I'm just not going to be able to be in a position to comment on stolen emails from someone's personal account that was hacked.\nQ: How about I'll rephrase it this way then: Is it still the U.S. position that missile defense systems in Asia are not intended toward China but are for other countries like North Korea?\nMR. SCHULTZ: We've been very clear about our positioning in that region. I don't have any new views to read out to you, but the President's views have been clear. We have assets there, A, to support our allies and to support our partners in the region. You all frequently ask us about North Korea and what we're doing, and it's important to us to make sure that our allies and our partners in the region know that we have their back. But I don't have anything new to read out to you on that.\nQ: There are some reports from Iraq suggesting that the Mosul offensive is being pushed back in part because of tensions between the Turks and the Iraqis, and you've seen some pretty strong statements from Shia militia leaders talking about liberating Mosul and taking revenge whenever they get there.\nI was wondering if you could confirm whether there's still more groundwork to be done before the Mosul offensive takes place there -- it seemed like it was imminent.\nMR. SCHULTZ: I'll say two things about this. One is, I suspect this to be a topic in today's NSC meeting, so I don't want to get ahead of anything that's discussed there. But to the extent that it is, we'll try and make sure that that's included in the readout.\nThe other thing I'll say is, I'll just restate our position generally, which is we strongly support Iraqi sovereignty and territorial integrity. And that is the entire premise of our global ISIL coalition. So if you want to fight ISIL in Iraq, you're going to do so at the invitation and with the permission of the Iraqi central government.\nQ: Have you heard anything from the President on Bob Dylan's Nobel?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I have not spoken to the President about it, but I believe he sent a tweet about it yesterday. And I think he believes that it's very well deserved.\nQ: Week ahead?\nMR. SCHULTZ: On Monday, the President will visit Benjamin Banneker Academic High School to highlight the progress his administration has made over the last eight years to improve education across the country, including in Washington, D.C., where a greater share of students in recent years are being prepared for success in college and throughout their careers.\nOn Tuesday, the President and First Lady will welcome Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and his wife to the White House for an official visit with a state dinner. The visit will be an opportunity for the United States and Italy to celebrate the depth and breadth of our relationship. The visit will also advance cooperation across a range of shared interests, from addressing climate change and the global refugee crisis, to promoting global security and inclusive economic growth.\nOn Wednesday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.\nAnd on Thursday, the President will travel to Miami-Dade College in Miami to deliver remarks about the Affordable Care Act and the progress made in ensuring that all Americans have access to quality, affordable health care. The President will also attend an event for Hillary For America, and later that evening return to Washington. Additional details about the President's travel to Florida will be made available in the coming days. As you know, this trip was rescheduled from last week.\nAnd on Friday, the President will have meetings at the White House in Washington.\nThank you.\nEND 1:36 P.M.

You are a true treasure to this nation, and I don't think many people know how valuable you are, how much knowledge you have up in that brain of yours. But it's just been fun to get to know you, and I'm going to miss you. But we've got a few more months, right? (Laughter.)\nI want to recognize and thank the White House Historical Association board members who are here and those who are not, the Preservation Committee members. And of course, I understand we have some wonderful college students who are joining us today. Where are you guys? Stand up so I know where you are. There you are. (Applause.) Yay! You look good! (Applause.) All right, I've embarrassed you enough too. (Laughter.) Have you been having a good time?\nAUDIENCE MEMBERS: Yes. (Laughter.)\nMRS. OBAMA: Well, I'm glad I got a chance to say hello to you. You guys are the next generation, so it's terrific when we get to have you here in the house and you get to hear all the wisdom. Because it's going to be you who will be standing and sitting in these seats in the future, so enjoy. You've got big shoes to fill.\nNow, normally Barack and I get a little nervous when we host a big event with lots of food and drinks around the artwork. (Laughter.) After all, we're moving out soon, and as I've said, we've got to get our security deposit back. (Laughter.) But something tells me that we don't have to worry about much with this group.\nAnd of course, the truth is that while my family might live upstairs, this beautiful home, this house -- the People's House -- belongs to every American. And we all have a stake in the history that happened here -– from Dolley Madison saving this amazing Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington from that fire, to Lincoln pacing these halls while saving our nation, to a 32-year-old Jacqueline Kennedy taking us on a national televised tour.\nAnd that's why, for decades, the White House Historical Association has taken the lead in protecting and strengthening the legacy of this extraordinary home –- from raising funds to running educational programs for young people like the ones here who have been hanging out with us today.\nAnd from the day my family got here, we've tried our best to further this mission by opening up the White House to as many people from as many backgrounds as possible. And you all have worked with us side by side all the way. Over the years, we have welcomed 4 million guests for public tours. And you all brought your shop back to the Booksellers library downstairs and offered our guests educational materials, ornaments and keepsakes.\nWhen we planted a vegetable garden on the South Lawn and invited students to harvest it, you created gardening and seed kits that inspired them to go home and plant gardens of their own. You helped us add new drapes and chairs to the State Dining Room and refresh the walls of the Blue Room. And just last year, we were proud to unveil our 11-piece State China Service -- Obama china -- (laughter) -- which can be integrated with prior settings to highlight and also extend the entire collection.\nAnd when we decided to expand our collection of 20th century art and recognize a wide range of American artists in these rooms, you all rolled up your sleeves and got to work. It's no accident that during meetings in my office in the East Wing that we sit next to a Rothko, or that folks sitting in the Oval Office or visiting can spot modern Native American pottery on the bookshelf or works by Edward Hopper on the wall.\nAs many of you know, the President and I, we are true art lovers. We don't know as much as some of our friends do, but we hope when we get out of here we'll learn a little bit more. But we think that all of our country's great artists have a place within these walls. And that's why, in one of our very first Preservation Committee meetings, I asked Bill Allman and some of our other members what it would take to turn the Old Family Dining Room into the first White House room devoted entirely to 20th century art. And I understand the students -- you guys held your panel there today. Pretty cool, right?\nBut we knew that that wouldn't be easy, that we would need support from generous donors and museum foundations, and we'd also need a lot of guidance from experts. But that didn't stop you all. You all stepped up and delivered in ways that I could have never dreamed of. And today, the Old Family Dining Room is a highlight of the public tour and an enduring tribute to modern artists -- from the Art Deco tea service, to the woven rug, to the stunning painting by Alma Thomas -- who, by the way, is the first African American woman to have her art work featured in this home. (Applause.) It's a beautiful space, and it turned out well.\nAnd as Mrs. Kennedy put it in that televised tour all those years ago, she said this house should always have \"all the history of our country in it.\" And thanks to all of you, today it does. Together, we added some new touches, and we preserved the proud history and character of this house for future generations.\nAnd more than anything else, that's really why we're here today. Because we all know that this work isn't just about one administration. First families are all just temporary residents in this house. And it's our job to take care of this place so that our grandchildren and their grandchildren can admire and enjoy this home as much as we have. And we couldn't have done it without all of you.\nSo today, I want to end as I started -- by thanking you for everything you've done for the White House and for the country. So I want you to enjoy your time here today. Spend some time in these wonderful rooms. Take your time. Take in all the beautiful artwork. And I hope you just have a wonderful afternoon.\nI'm going to get out of the way so you can get that done. And I'm going to turn this stage over to Bill Allman, who will direct you.\nBut thank you, thank you, thank you. This has been just a pleasure to take care of this house. And I hope that you're proud of all we've done this year -- or this administration. Thank you.

At the North American Leaders' Summit (NALS) in Ottawa on June 29, 2016, the governments of Mexico, Canada, and the United States decided to form a North American Working Group on Violence against Indigenous Women and Girls, as a commitment to coordinated action to address the disproportionate levels of violence faced by Indigenous women and girls.\nThese new opportunities for coordinated action symbolize today's convening of leaders from all three of our countries at the White House and reaffirm our respective national and regional commitments to: exchanging knowledge of policies, programs and best practices to prevent and respond to violence against Indigenous women and girls through increased access to justice and health services, with a human rights and culturally-responsive approach; enhancing cooperation to address violent crimes against Indigenous women and girls, including human trafficking, within or outside of their communities and across our borders; and, enhancing the response of our justice, health, education, and child welfare systems to violence against Indigenous women and girls.\nWe are proud to announce that the next trilateral meeting of the working group will be hosted by Canada in 2017. Together, our three countries are committed to including full participation of Indigenous groups as part of the next meeting.\nCriminal justice responses to violence against Indigenous women and girls, including regional coordination on law enforcement data\n•      Roundtable on Regional Law Enforcement Coordination on Violence against Indigenous Women and Girls: The U.S., Mexico, and Canada, will organize a roundtable and knowledge exchange on the coordination of law enforcement in the North American region, particularly across borders, on missing, murdered, and trafficked, Indigenous women and girls, potentially to be held during the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (PFII) in May 2017. This discussion could spur all countries to take stock of how our national law enforcement and crime investigation units are already cooperating through the U.S. Justice Department's program, NamUs, and could agree to discuss possible expansion of the coordination on missing and murdered persons cases involving gender violence.\n•      Exchanging Knowledge and Best Practices on Indigenous Justice Practices: All three countries committed to participate in future activity to discuss Indigenous justice practices that support access to justice for Indigenous women and girls, including identifying culturally appropriate ways to measure and evaluate these practices. This would support ongoing work at the United Nations Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and through the Open Government Partnership.\nSocial services & public health prevention and response to violence against Indigenous women and girls\n•      Knowledge Exchange on Regional Ethnicity and Health hosted by the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO): On 21-23 November 2016, public health leaders from the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and other countries will convene representatives at PAHO for a knowledge exchange on the health priorities of Indigenous, Afro-descendant and other ethnic/racial groups in situation of vulnerability living in the Americas. Specific health priorities include: violence against Indigenous and Afro-descendant women and girls, mental health, HIV, tuberculosis, and immunization.\n•      Side event on Indigenous Women and Girls at 2017 World Health Assembly: The U.S., Mexico, and Canada, will jointly elevate the issue of the health sector's role in addressing the causes of health disparities for Indigenous women and girls including barriers in access to health resources and victim services for gender violence, by co-hosting a side event on the role of the health sector in improving health system responses to this violence at the May 2017 World Health Assembly, building on recommendations of the WHO Plan of Action and the PAHO Regional Plan of Action on Violence against Women and Children.\nHuman rights, women, peace, and security: prioritizing Indigenous women and girls in multilateral affairs\n•      Joint Statement at United Nations Human Rights Council: At the 2016 September United Nations Human Rights Council, the U.S., Mexico, and Canada,  delivered a joint statement announcing the establishment of the North American Working Group to demonstrate the highest level commitment to improving regional responses to eliminate all forms of violence against Indigenous women and girls, encouraging other Member States to replicate this effort as a model for regional coordination.\n•      Trilateral Commemoration of the 10th Anniversary of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples: The U.S., Mexico, and Canada, will jointly recognize the 10th anniversary of the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples on the margins of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues in May 2017.\n•      Side event at 2017 UN Commission on the Status of Women: The U.S, Mexico, and Canada have committed to co-host a high-level side event on empowerment as a means to effectively eliminate all forms of violence against Indigenous women and girls at the 61st UN Commission on the Status of Women, in March 2017, in recognition of this year's review theme of empowering Indigenous women and girls.\n•      U.S. International Visitors Leadership Program: The U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs in coordination with the U.S. Embassies in Ottawa and Mexico City intend to sponsor an exchange program in Spring 2017 to bring together Indigenous youth leaders from Mexico, Canada, and the United States. The program will connect these youth leaders to representatives from government, private enterprise, and civil society to find innovative ways to promote economic competitiveness while preserving cultural heritage and protecting the environment. The program will expose Indigenous youth leaders to methods and tools for shaping policy and messaging aligned with their ideals and include a focus on how the participants can promote gender equality in their communities and prevent violence against Indigenous women.", "timestamp": "2016-10-14", "title": "Fact Sheet: Key Deliverables for the Inaugural Meeting of the North American Working Group on Violence against Indigenous Women and Girls"}

Thank you! Thank you so much. Hello, Cleveland! Well, the——\nAudience member. I love you, Barack!\nThe President. I love you back. I do. I do.\nThe head of the airport here pointed out that in 2012, one of our last rallies was right here. Some of you might have been there. But I've got to say, it was an amazing rally, and everybody was so enthusiastic, and it was a beautiful——\nAudience member. Still are!\nThe President. Still fired up! But the one thing I've got to say, though, is, since I've been in Cleveland, this time it seems like there's an extra pep in your step. I don't know what happened exactly. I don't know whether I'm—did something happen here in Cleveland? Did LeBron have something to do with it? All right, well, congratulations, everybody.\nCan everybody please give Jackie a big round of applause, not just for the introduction, but for her service to our country? We've got some outstanding Members of Congress who are here. Marcia Fudge is in the house. Marcy Kaptur is here. Your outstanding mayor, Frank Jackson, is here. And although he's campaigning elsewhere in the State, I want to make sure we give a shout out to your former Governor and the next United States Senator from Ohio, Ted Strickland. Well——\nAudience members. We love you!\nThe President. I know. I love you back but—thank you, guys. Thank you.\nSo this will probably be one of the last times that I visit Cleveland as your President.\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. No, no, I'm going to come back to Cleveland, we'll just have—I'll go to a game. But no, understand, Michelle and I, our lease was only 8 years. So now we're making sure we didn't break any china, making sure Bo and Sunny haven't ruined too many carpets. [Laughter] We wanted to get our security deposit back. [Laughter] But we are so grateful, so blessed, to have had all your support over these years. And it's been a great privilege.\nAnd I remember when we were campaigning here on that closing day. And we were in the midst of two long wars, putting an enormous burden on our military families. We were in the early days of what would turn out to be the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes. You had all kinds of challenges, from health care to climate change, where we weren't even pretending to do something about it. We were just kicking the can down the road.\nAnd I told you then, 8 years ago, that I wasn't a perfect person and I wasn't going to be a perfect President, but what I guaranteed you was that I would work every single day as hard as I could to make sure that working families all across this country got a better deal. And you gave me the honor of serving you, and 8 years later, we have fought our way back from recession. We have helped our auto industry set new records. Our businesses have turned job losses into 15 million new jobs. We've slashed our dependence on foreign oil.\n[At this point, there was a disruption in the audience.]\nHold on a second, young man. Don't be interrupting everybody. Come on. Come on, sir. Come on. Everybody is going—come on, everybody. Let's do our little chant. Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!\nAudience members. Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!\nThe President. All right, I think we're okay now. I notice this has been happening everywhere, and I keep on telling folks you've got to organize your own rallies. [Laughter] Don't—if you're confident about the other guy, just go to his rallies. I feel confident about my candidate. That's why I'm at this rally. So you don't have to spend time over here. Go knock on some doors for your guy. That's a better way for you to spend your time. [Laughter] Unless you're just being paid to be here, in which case, hey, you know, everybody's got to make a living. [Laughter]\nWhere was I? [Laughter] So 8 years ago, we were in tough situations. But because of your resilience, because of your faith in each other, in this country, we have slashed our unemployment rate in half. Incomes are rising again. In fact, incomes went up last year by the largest amount that has ever been measured. Poverty is falling. In fact, last year, poverty went down faster than any time since 1968. Twenty million people have health insurance who didn't have it before. The uninsured rate is now at an alltime low.\nWe brought more of our brave troops home to their families. We delivered justice to Usama bin Laden. Marriage equality is a reality in all 50 States. By almost every measure, our economy is better than it was when we came into office. And that's not just true across the country, it's true right here in Ohio.\nYou just look at the auto industry that was flat on its back when we came into office and now is selling the best cars in the world and is doing as well or better than ever before. And that means there are hundreds of thousands of folks here in Ohio that have benefited.\nSo we've been busy. But I'm here to tell you——\nAudience member. Tell us!\nThe President. I'm here—you want me to tell you? [Laughter] I'm here to tell you that all that progress goes out the window if we don't make the right choice right now. And it shouldn't be a complicated choice, because it's a choice between somebody who is as qualified as anybody who has ever run for this office and somebody who has proven himself unfit to lead or represent this country that we love.\nAnd I've said this before: Democrats and Republicans have always had their differences, and that's a good thing. That's how democracy is supposed to work. And when I was running against John McCain, when I was running against Mitt Romney, we had serious disagreements and debates about economic policy and foreign policy and social policy. And those elections were close. And I thought I had the better argument and I'd be the better President. But I could have seen either one of them serving honorably, not embarrassing us on the world stage. They would have engaged in legitimate debates and normal democratic processes.\nBut that's not the case with today's Republican nominee. He doesn't have the temperament. He doesn't have the knowledge. He doesn't seem to have the interest in acquiring the knowledge or the basic honesty that a President needs to have. And that was true before we heard him——\nAudience member. That's right, sir!\nThe President. ——talking about how he treats women. And it was——\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. Don't boo. What do I say?\nAudience members. Vote!\nThe President. Don't boo, vote.\nAnd by the way, that was true when he talked about how Muslims are unpatriotic or when he talked about how Mexicans were rapists or when he made fun of somebody who was disabled. Or he talked about our veterans and our troops and our Gold Star mom.\nYou know, you don't have to be a husband or a father to know that that kind of language, those kinds of thoughts, those kinds of actions——\nAudience member. Unacceptable!\nThe President. ——are unacceptable. They're not right. You just have to be a decent human being.\nAnd for those of you who didn't have a chance to hear Michelle yesterday talk about what it meant to her, I could not be prouder of her. I said yesterday that this is why I married her, to improve my gene pool to—[laughter]—so my daughters would be smarter than me. But she was sticking up. Yes, she was sticking up for women. Yes, she was thinking about the lessons we're teaching the next generation. She was also talking on behalf of men who know we're better than this or who don't want to teach our sons the kind of things that we've been hearing on television; that believe that one of the measures of any society is how does it treat its women, how does it treat its girls? Are you treating them with respect and dignity and equality? And if you believe that we are better than what we've been hearing, the good news is, as she pointed out yesterday, there's something we can do about it. Right here in Ohio, a battleground State. Ohio is always close.\nAnd so you can go vote early right now. Early voting started on Wednesday. And I know everybody here is early voting, because otherwise, you wouldn't be here. If you stood in line to get in this rally, then you've got enough sense to go early vote. But for those of you who are—may not be here, and you don't even know if you're registered, you need to go to iwillvote.com/locate, and you can find the early vote site nearest you. Or you can request a mail-in ballot.\nI'm going to repeat that website: iwillvote.com/locate. This is not an infomercial. [Laughter] This is an opportunity for you to exercise your——\nAudience member. Right to vote!\nThe President. ——your right to vote, your civic responsibility, the essence of citizenship. And you don't need to wait until election day.\nYou have a chance to reject a dark and pessimistic vision of a country where we turn against each other, where we turn away from our role in the world. You can reject a politics of fear and resentment and blame and anger and hate. You can choose the America we know ourselves to be, a country full of courage and optimism, a country full of generosity and ingenuity.\nWe've got real challenges still. When I ran 8 years ago, I said we're not going to solve everything in one Presidency. We've got real challenges. There are folks out there who are still struggling to pay the bills. There are students who are still trying to figure out how to pay off student loan debt. There are parents who are still concerned about caring for a sick child or worried about whether they're going to be able to keep their home. Everybody is worried about political gridlock. All across the country, people are concerned about the possibilities of increased racial division. There are pockets of Ohio and pockets of America, despite the progress we've made, that haven't recovered from factory closures. There are young people who are worried about whether they're going to have the same opportunities that we've had.\nBut I will tell you this: I've traveled all 50 States. I have talked to hundreds of thousands of people. And what I've seen more than anything else is everything that's good about America, everything that's right about America. I see people working hard. I see people starting businesses. I see teachers teaching kids, taking money out of their own pockets to make sure they've got school supplies. I've seen doctors who are out there serving the indigent and the poor, making sure they've got health care. I have seen our men and women in uniform serving to make sure we are safe. I've seen police officers and law enforcement and first responders who run into danger instead of run away from it.\nI've seen young activists who call on us to live up to our highest ideals. I see a young generation that is full of energy and ideas and is not going to be held back by what is right now, but is going to seize what ought to be. And I see, most of all, Americans of every party, background, every faith who believe that we are stronger together—young, old, Black, White, Latino, Asian, Native American, folks with disabilities—all of us pledging allegiance to that same proud flag. That is the America that I know.\nAnd there's only one candidate in this race who's devoted her life to that vision of a better America and that is the next President of the United States, Hillary Clinton.\nNow, her opponent has made it pretty clear he's just going to drag this election as low as it can possibly go. And he figures that if he makes our politics just toxic, then maybe you'll just figure out, you've got no good choices and you just get discouraged and you just don't vote.\nAudience member. He's wrong!\nThe President. But don't fall for it.\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. Because I'm telling you right now, Hillary is one of the smartest, toughest, best prepared, most experienced persons ever to run for this job. You know, there's nothing that completely prepares you for what it's like to manage a global crisis or send a young person to war. But Hillary has been in the room when those decisions were made. She's been a First Lady. She has been a Senator. She has been my Secretary of State. And in each and every job she has worked tirelessly and diligently, and she's listened to the American people.\nShe's done her homework. She has performed. She knows what the decisions that a President makes mean concretely for a soldier or a veteran, for a kid who needs a great education, for a worker who is still looking for a good job or a raise or a decent retirement. Even in the middle of crisis, she keeps her cool, and she pays everybody the proper respect. And most importantly, no matter how tough the odds, no matter how much people try to knock her down, she doesn't point fingers or whine. She doesn't talk about how everything is rigged. She just works harder and gets the job done and never, ever quits. She doesn't quit, and she doesn't make excuses. And by the way, isn't that what you want from a President?\nYou know, I notice, her opponent——\nAudience member. He's a crybaby! [Laughter]\nThe President. He seems to be in the middle of the game, making excuses all the time for why he might be losing. [Laughter] And it's always interesting to me to see folks who talk tough, but then don't act tough. Because if you're tough, you don't make excuses. You don't start complaining about the refs before the game is even done. You just play the game, right?\nThat's what Hillary Clinton is doing. She's out there playing the game. She's just in the arena for you, fighting every single day to make sure that everybody gets a fair shake. That's what she's doing. There is not a person out there who has been more qualified to serve as our President. That includes me, and that includes Bill. [Laughter]\nAnd she's going to be great at it. She's got real plans to address the things she's heard from you: specific ideas to invest in new jobs; specific ideas to help workers share in their company's profits; specific ideas to make sure that fewer jobs move overseas, to make sure that jobs come back in places that have been abandoned, to invest in our people, to put kids in preschool, to put students through college without taking on a ton of debt.\nYou know, her opponent's maybe getting headlines this week for picking fights with everybody in his own party, threatening to sue the press for stories he doesn't like. Meanwhile, you know what Hillary is doing? She's been talking about what we need to do to fight climate change. She put forward a child tax credit that would help millions of families. She wasn't complaining or whining or fighting, she was just doing the work. And that's what you want from a President: somebody who is going to sit there and do the work for you. Her opponent, he doesn't make very specific plans.\nAudience member. No plans! No plans!\nThe President. If you asked his opponents right now—if you asked his supporters right now, it would be really hard for them to describe what exactly they were going to do. He says he's great at making deals. But as I pointed out, I don't know a lot of people who operate a casino and manage to lose almost a billion dollars in 1 year. [Laughter] Usually, the house wins. You know that saying \"the house always wins\"? [Laughter] Unless he owns the house; then, it loses a billion dollars. [Laughter]\nI don't know a lot of successful business people who just use that failure of losing a billion dollars to then avoid paying Federal income taxes. He says it makes him smart. [Laughter] All it does is, it means he's not doing what all of us as citizens should be doing, which is giving back to our troops and our veterans, and our roads and our schools and making sure that America continues to be the greatest nation on Earth. That's part of citizenship. Not trying to weasel out of your responsibilities. That's not smart. And then, you want to lead the country? What is that? You're going to teach everybody how to avoid doing their responsibilities? [Laughter]\nHe rooted for a housing crisis because he said it might help his real estate situation. He says, \"That's called business.\" Filed for bankruptcy six times, and then, that allowed him to stiff small businesses and their workers that had already done work for him and that he owed money. When your concern isn't the family that's worried about foreclosure or the small business that is just trying to make ends meet, you'd rather make a buck off their dreams, but not being honest on the other side of your deal, then you can't claim to lead this country. You're not fit to be President of the United States.\nAnd I have to say—because he's getting some support from some working folks. And I want to say to them, look, if a guy spent 70 years on this Earth showing no regard for working people—there's no record that he's supported minimum wage or supported collective bargaining or invested in poor communities—and then suddenly, he's going to be the champion of working people? Come on. Come on, man. [Laughter]\nApparently, in a speech yesterday, he started talking about global elites, that there was a conspiracy of global elites. This is a guy who spent all his time hanging around trying to convince everybody he was a global elite. [Laughter] Talking about how great his buildings are and how luxurious. And how rich he is and flying around everywhere. All he had time for was celebrities. And now suddenly, he's acting like he's a populist out there: \"Man, I'm going to fight for working people.\" Come on, man. [Laughter]\nYou want to know what somebody is going to do, look what they've been doing their whole lives. And if you want a leader who actually values hard work and respects working Americans, if you want higher wages and better benefits and a fair Tax Code and equal pay for women and stronger regulations on Wall Street, then you should vote for Hillary Clinton!\nIf you want to know who is going to keep you safe in a dangerous world, the choice is even clearer. Hillary is going to make sure we finish the job of defeating ISIL, and she won't have to resort to torture or ban entire religions from our country. And she's got the knowledge and the experience and the temperament to be the next Commander in Chief.\nYou can't have a guy who's insulted POWs and attacks a Gold Star mom and has called our troops and veterans weak and cozies up to dictators and tells our allies we might not stand by their side unless they pay up first. He may be up at 3 a.m. in the morning, but it's because he's tweeting insults to somebody who got under his skin. [Laughter] That's not the kind of President you want. Not fit to be Commander in Chief and not fit to lead the world's greatest democracy.\nAnd by the way, this is somebody who threatens to jail his political opponents or silence the media, who welcomes Russian meddling in our electoral process and is now suggesting that if the election doesn't go his way, it's not because all the stuff he said——\nAudience member. It's somebody else's fault!\nThe President. ——but because it's rigged and it's a fraud. Some nations do operate that way. And they're tyrannies. And they're oppressive. They're not the world's greatest democracy. We have fought against those kinds of things. We—around the world, we talk to other countries. We say, no, in a democracy you can't just threaten to jail your opponents. There are things called due process. No, in a democracy, you can't just ban reporters or press that you don't like, because there's this thing called the First Amendment. No, in a democracy, you have a contest, but if you lose, then you say congratulations, and you move on, because the country and our system of government is bigger than any single individual.\nThat's what we do. The United States of America has always stood for something better. Which by the way—I said this last night; I've just got to go back to this again—it's part of why I'm disturbed about Republican elected officials who know better, but are still supporting this guy. I said that, in part, what's happened here is, over the last 8 years, Republican officials who know better, some of whom I talk to—they're sane people. They're normal folks but what they've done is, they have allowed a lot of crazy talk to just be pumped out again and again through all kinds of these media outlets. Conspiracy theories—I was born outside this country, and Hillary and I started ISIL—[laughter]—and we're going to impose martial law, and we're trying to take everybody's guns away, and crazier stuff than that.\nAnd a lot of Republican elected officials have just stood by. A lot of House Members, a lot of Senators, they stood by, and they didn't say anything because it was a way to rile up their base, and it was a way to mount opposition to whatever we were trying to do. And over time, because a lot of the hardcore Republican partisan voters were just hearing this stuff over and over again, they started to believe it. And that's what allowed Donald Trump suddenly to emerge. Donald Trump didn't build all this crazy conspiracy stuff.\nAnd some Republicans who knew better stood by silently, and even during the course of this campaign, didn't say anything. I mean, I know that some of them now are walking away. But why did it take you this long? You said you're the party of family values. What, you weren't appalled earlier when he was saying degrading things about women? When he was judging them based on a score of are they a two or a ten? That wasn't enough for you? You're walking away from him now. You—it wasn't disturbing enough for you when he was saying Mexicans who come here are rapists or suggesting that people—patriotic Americans of the Islamic faith—are somehow are suspect and should be treated differently? That wasn't enough?\nI'm glad that some of them now say, \"Wow, this is really bad. I guess we need to walk away.\" But if you're doing it just for political expedience, just because you're looking at poll numbers, and you say, \"Oh, this might get me in trouble\"—that's not enough.\nIf you say you're about family values, you've got to be about family values all the way through. If you spent all these years extolling Reagan and how tough he was with the Russians, how is it that you suddenly stand silently when you nominate a guy who says his—a guy he admires is the former head of the KGB? If you say that you're about the Constitution and you're opposed to what Obama is doing with executive actions because that shows you're—he's a tyrant, but you're okay with a guy who says to his opponent in the middle of the debate, I'm going to throw you in jail.\nAudience members. Crazy!\nThe President. How does that work? [Laughter]\nAudience member. It doesn't!\nThe President. It doesn't work.\nAnd that's why I want everybody to understand what's at stake here. You know, one of the things I've learned these past 8 years is that progress is hard, but you've got to battle it out. And even when you have victories, like the Affordable Care Act, it's not always perfect, and you've got to work to make it better. And you take two steps forward on something like climate change, there are going to be folks who try and push you back. And the special interests are strong, and it is true that the country is so often divided along party lines, and it's very hard to get folks to compromise.\nAnd Hillary understands all that. But what she also knows is that if you stay at it and you work hard, good things can happen. She knows that in a democracy as big and diverse as this, we can't demonize each other. We can't just refuse to compromise. Even when we're right, we've got to work with other folks. She knows that you've got to listen to each other and see ourselves in each other and fight for our principles. She believes that there's common ground out there.\nAnd she believes that we can and should conduct ourselves better; that our leaders are not going to be perfect, but we should aspire to at least express the decency and goodness of the American people, not our worst impulses. We should conduct ourselves with just a basic sense of——\nAudience member. Dignity!\nThe President. ——what this country is about: a certain sense of dignity. And that's not always flashy. That doesn't always grab headlines. That's not always the thing that will get you on the news. That's not always— doesn't fit on a tweet. Politics doesn't always lend itself to that. But if we want our—if we want progress, we've got to work for it. Progress, it doesn't always come right away, and we don't always get a hundred percent what we want. But if we keep at it the way Hillary has kept at it, decade after decade, progress happens.\nAnd if you don't believe that, ask the 20 million more Americans who've got health insurance today that didn't have it before. Ask all those autoworkers right here in Ohio who had been laid off and thought their plant was going to shut down, and now they're working double shifts because we're cranking out so many cars. Ask the proud marine who no longer has to hide the husband that he loves. Ask the young persons who are getting more help now to pay off their student loans. Change is possible. But it doesn't just depend on one person, it depends on all of us.\nAnd so, young people especially out there, I want you to know, you've been through a lot. You've grown up through war and recession and all kinds of incredible change, but I have seen in you the best in America. I see that you don't try to turn against each other. You're trying to look out for each other. I know you care about being open to the world, not turning away from it. I know that you believe in an inclusive society, an innovative society, and a vibrant society. And you believe in democracy. And I see the same values in you that have always driven this country forward: decency and honesty and hard work and civility. They are not old-fashioned values, they are timeless values. They're what binds this country together.\nAnd so even though sometimes politics can seem frustrating, even though sometimes our democracy can seem mean spirited, you have a chance right now to reject that kind of politics. You have a chance to reject the politics of fear. You can lift, again, back up the politics of hope. Let's not go backwards; let's go forward.\nYou've got a chance to elect a woman who's spent her entire life trying to make this country better. Don't fall for the easy cynicism that says your vote doesn't matter. Don't fall for what Trump tries to do and just make everybody depressed. Don't believe it. I promise you, your vote counts. Your vote matters.\nThere was a time when folks couldn't vote, when you had to guess the number of jellybeans in a jar to vote, the number of soap bubbles on a bar of soap to vote. Folks were beaten to vote. Folks risked everything to vote.\nIn this election, whatever the issue you care about, it could not be easier for you to vote. If you care about inequality, you need to vote. If you \"felt the Bern\" in the primaries, you need to vote. You can vote for somebody who only cares about themselves or somebody who is going to fight like heck for working people. Make sure we've got a minimum wage raise. Make sure we've got equal pay for equal work. You care about criminal justice reform and civil rights, you can vote for somebody who has fought against civil rights for most of their lives, or you can vote for somebody who went undercover to make sure that minority kids were getting an equal shot at a good education and has never stopped fighting since.\nYou care about the environment and climate change, you can vote for somebody who thinks it's a Chinese hoax, or you can care—you can vote for somebody who thinks that there's something called science and that we should pay attention to it and will fight to protect our planet.\nYou care about immigration reform and want us to continue to see this Nation as one that is a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants, then you've got to get out there and vote.\nDonald Trump's closing argument is, \"What do you have to lose?\" [Laughter] The answer is everything. All the progress we've made right now is on the ballot. Civility is on the ballot. Tolerance is on the ballot. Courtesy is on the ballot. Honesty is on the ballot. Equality is on the ballot. Kindness is on the ballot. All the progress we've made the last 8 years is on the ballot. Democracy itself is on the ballot right now.\nSo if you want to send a message, make it loud. Turn back the voices of cynicism. Turn back the voices of ignorance. Send a message of progress. Send a message of hope. Send a message by voting for Hillary Clinton, and show our kids and the rest of the world we remain the greatest country in the world.\nThank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Hey!", "timestamp": "2016-10-14", "title": "Remarks at a Campaign Rally for Democratic Presidential Nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton in Cleveland, Ohio"}

The Commission is tasked with the important work of undertaking a comprehensive study of Federal, State, local, and tribal programs that serve Native children, and making recommendations on how those programs could be improved. Over the past 8 years, my Administration has been committed to working closely with tribes to strengthen our nation-to-nation relationships and to forge a brighter future for all our children. During my own visits to Indian Country, I have been inspired by the talent and enthusiasm of young people who want nothing more than to make a positive difference in their communities. From the Indian Child Welfare Act to working to return control of Indian education to tribal nations, I am proud of the progress we have made over the past 8 years. I applaud the Congress, and in particular Senator Heitkamp, for the efforts that made this new law possible.\nThe bill provides for a Commission consisting of three individuals appointed by the President and eight individuals appointed by congressional leaders, and would place this Commission in a specific office within the Department of Justice. While I welcome the creation of this Commission, it cannot be located in the executive branch consistent with the separation of powers because it includes legislative branch appointees (who here are empowered to direct other executive branch agencies to provide additional resources to the Commission). I am therefore instructing the Attorney General to treat the Commission as an independent entity, separate from the executive branch.\nUpon signing the bill my Administration will begin seeking appointments for the Commission from the Congress so we can implement this legislation as soon as possible.

Today, we live in a time of extraordinary possibility—and we must decide how our next chapters will be written. The task of shaping America's course falls to each one of us as individuals who make up our American family, and as we celebrate National Character Counts Week, let us seek to live out the ideals that have inspired our country's journey and that define our national character.\nNo matter who you are, what you look like, where you come from, or what your circumstances are, America should be a place where the things that make you unique and different are celebrated. That promise of equality and acceptance has been our country's North Star since its founding, and in thinking of how that centuries-old ideal translates into our lives today, it comes down to all of us showing others the compassion and acceptance that we would only wish for ourselves. If we seek to understand one another and take advantage of opportunities to bring people together across lines of difference, we will increasingly realize as a people that we are more alike than we are different.\nLet us listen to each other, see each other, and recognize the common humanity that makes America what it is. Let us embrace the multitudes of races, faiths, cultures, and origins that make up our diverse, vibrant Nation. It will make us better as a people and stronger as a country, and it starts with reflecting on the way we live our lives, the way we treat others, and the example we set for those around us. We have a collective obligation to reflect in our own lives the values we strive to reflect in our national life, and no gesture of goodwill is too small—together, ripples of kindness can drown out voices of hate, wash away cynicism and doubt, and help us see the world in truer colors.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 16 through October 22, 2016, as National Character Counts Week. I call upon public officials, educators, parents, students, and all Americans to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-10-14", "title": "Proclamation 9523—National Character Counts Week, 2016"}

Across America, they offer a wide range of cultural and recreational activities that have sustained and entertained people since long before our Nation's founding. Today, forests provide products we use each day, including paper, wood, and building and packaging materials. During National Forest Products Week, we express our appreciation for the incredible bounty forests provide and we renew our commitment to ensuring the next generation can enjoy their irreplaceable resources.\nOur forests are at increasing risk from catastrophic wildfires, erosion, drought, and climate change. That is why my Administration is working alongside State and local leaders, landowners, and businesses to develop solutions to preserve our forests—because we must respond to challenges that threaten these important spaces. America's forests play an important role in addressing climate change by absorbing carbon pollution. It is critical that we protect and restore our forests, and through the Climate Action Plan, Federal agencies are coming together to strengthen the resilience of our forests and enhance their ability to absorb even more carbon pollution.\nThe health and well-being of our forests and our communities go hand in hand. With the Department of Agriculture, we are working to strengthen markets for forest products. By allocating millions of dollars to help expand technologies that encourage the use of wood in innovative ways, we are also striving to improve forest health and generate rural jobs. And we are exploring ways to help forestland owners respond to climate change—earlier this year, we released a roadmap for implementing key building blocks to achieve this goal, such as private forest growth and retention, stewardship of Federal forests, and promotion of wood products.\nForests generate billions of dollars in economic growth, sustaining local economies and enhancing communities across our country. We rely on them in so many aspects of our national life, and throughout this week, we must continue working to protect the precious resources our forests hold so they can continue enriching our world and supporting our way of life.\nTo recognize the importance of products from our forests, the Congress, by Public Law 86-753 (36 U.S.C. 123), as amended, has designated the week beginning on the third Sunday in October of each year as \"National Forest Products Week\" and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this week.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim October 16 through October 22, 2016, as National Forest Products Week. I call on the people of the United States to join me in recognizing the dedicated individuals who are responsible for the stewardship of our forests and for the preservation, management, and use of these precious natural resources for the benefit of the American people.

In order to ensure more Americans with disabilities can continue participating fully in our country, we must each do our part to promote equal opportunity for all. On Blind Americans Equality Day, we reaffirm the inherent dignity of every human being and recommit to forging a future in which all Americans, including those with visual impairments, can pursue their full measure of happiness.\nMore than two decades ago, one of the most comprehensive civil rights bills in our history, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), was signed into law. Ever since, the ADA has helped reduce discrimination and promote equal access to classrooms, workplaces, and transportation—and it is imperative that we build on the significant progress we have made for individuals living with disabilities. Because the unemployment rate is more than twice as high for Americans with disabilities, my Administration has worked to improve employment opportunities, including within the Federal Government where we are leading as a model employer. Last year, we hosted the White House Summit on Disability and Employment, which provided resources to help employers hire more individuals with disabilities. And through the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, we expanded access to critical services for many individuals with disabilities, including those who are blind or visually impaired, so that they can pursue high-quality employment opportunities. People with disabilities deserve to live their lives in their communities and raise their families, and earlier this year we hosted a Forum on the Civil Rights of Parents with Disabilities because every family, including those headed by people with disabilities, deserves the chance to reach for a future of ever greater possibility.\nOur Nation must continue to promote equal opportunity and the right of all Americans to live full and independent lives. This begins early on—we must ensure that any child with a print disability can access the tools they need to pursue an education. That is why we have worked to provide appropriate materials and services, including Braille and Braille literacy instruction, in schools. We are investing in technologies that provide visually impaired students equal access to the general education curriculum. We are also working to make the websites of Government agencies and private companies more accessible to anyone with a disability—an effort which remains an important priority. And I have encouraged the Senate to ratify the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired, or Otherwise Print Disabled, which will broaden access to a new world of knowledge for these individuals.\nDisability touches us all, and together we can strive to ensure that all blind and visually impaired individuals face no unnecessary barriers to success. By providing equal access to resources and technologies and giving everyone the chance to make of their lives what they will, we can continue to advance opportunity and prosperity for all our people. By joint resolution approved on October 6, 1964 (Public Law 88-628, as amended), the Congress designated October 15 of each year as \"White Cane Safety Day\" to recognize the contributions of Americans who are blind or have low vision. Today, let us reaffirm our commitment to being a Nation where all our people, including those with disabilities, have every opportunity to achieve their dreams.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 15, 2016, as Blind Americans Equality Day. I call upon public officials, business and community leaders, educators, librarians, and Americans across the country to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-10-14", "title": "Proclamation 9525—Blind Americans Equality Day, 2016"}

Introduction\nOn December 17, 2014, I announced that the United States would chart a new course with Cuba, ending an outdated policy that had failed to advance U.S. interests and support reform and a better life for the Cuban people on the island over several decades. Under the new policy, the United States expands and promotes authorized engagements with Cuba to advance cooperation on areas of mutual interest, and increase travel to, commerce with, and the free flow of information to Cuba. The objective of the new policy is to help the Cuban people to achieve a better future for themselves and to encourage the development of a partner in the region capable of working with the United States to confront regional challenges, such as climate change, disease, and illicit trafficking.\nEndogenous changes underway in Cuba offer opportunities to advance U.S. interests and shift away from an embargo, which is an outdated burden on the Cuban people and has impeded U.S. interests. My Administration has repeatedly called on the Congress to lift the embargo. United States policy is designed to create economic opportunities for the Cuban people; promote respect for human rights; further advances on regional security and defense issues, such as health, law enforcement, and migration; and pursue cooperation with the Cuban government that can strengthen our leadership in the hemisphere. We recognize Cuba's sovereignty and self-determination and acknowledge areas of difference. We seek to address such differences through engagement and dialogue, and by encouraging increased understanding between our governments and our peoples.\nThe large Cuban-American community in the United States has an integral role to play in normalization, and in reconciliation between members of the diaspora who left Cuba and those who remain on the island. Normalization necessarily extends beyond government-to-government rapprochement—it includes rebuilding bridges between individuals and families. This directive: (1) describes the U.S. vision for normalization with Cuba and how our policy aligns with U.S. national security interests; (2) assesses progress toward normalization; (3) describes the current and foreseen strategic landscape; (4) describes priority objectives for normalization; and (5) directs actions required to implement this PPD.\nII. Vision for United States-Cuba Normalization\nThe vision of the United States for U.S.-Cuba normalization is guided by the following national security interests, as described in the 2015 National Security Strategy:\n• The security of the United States, its citizens, and U.S. allies and partners. • A strong, innovative, and growing U.S. economy in an open international economic system that promotes opportunity and prosperity. • Respect for universal values at home and around the world. • A rules-based international order that promotes peace, security, and opportunity.\nOur vision for U.S.-Cuba normalization reflects my Administration's support for broad-based economic growth, stability, increased people-to-people ties, and respect for human rights and democratic values in the region. In the long-term, the United States seeks the following end-states:\n1. Enhanced security of the United States and U.S. citizens at home and abroad. We seek to ensure U.S. citizens traveling to Cuba are safe and secure and the United States is protected from: those seeking to exploit increased connectivity for illicit ends, irregular migration, and natural or man-made hazards. Our policy advances bilateral cooperation in areas of mutual interest, including diplomatic, agricultural, public health, and environmental matters, as well as disaster preparedness and response, law enforcement, migration, and other security and defense topics. Our policy also supports increased cooperation with Cuba on regional initiatives on behalf of these interests.\n2. A prosperous, stable Cuba that offers economic opportunities to its people. Increased travel and economic interconnectedness supports improved livelihoods for the Cuban people, deeper economic engagement between our two countries, as well as the development of a private sector that provides greater economic opportunities for the Cuban people. Efforts by the Cuban authorities to liberalize economic policy would aid these goals and further enable broader engagement with different sectors of the Cuban economy. United States policy helps U.S. businesses gain access to Cuban markets and encourages the sustainable growth of the Cuban economy. The U.S. private sector, scientific and medical researchers, agriculture industry, foundations, and other groups have new avenues for collaboration that can provide opportunities for Cuban entrepreneurs, scientists, farmers, and other professionals. At the same time, increased access to the internet is boosting Cubans' connectivity to the wider world and expanding the ability of the Cuban people, especially youth, to exchange information and ideas. The United States is prepared to support Cuban government policies that promote social equality and independent economic activity.\n3. Increased respect for individual rights in Cuba. Even as we pursue normalization, we recognize we will continue to have differences with the Cuban government. We will continue to speak out in support of human rights, including the rights to freedoms of expression, religion, association, and peaceful assembly as we do around the world. Our policy is designed to support Cubans' ability to exercise their universal human rights and fundamental freedoms, with the expectation that greater commerce will give a broader segment of the Cuban people the information and resources they need to achieve a prosperous and sustainable future. In pursuit of these objectives, we are not seeking to impose regime change on Cuba; we are, instead, promoting values that we support around the world while respecting that it is up to the Cuban people to make their own choices about their future.\n4. Integration of Cuba into international and regional systems. We seek Cuban government participation in regional and international fora, including but not limited to, those related to the Organization of American States (OAS) and Summit of the Americas to advance mutually held member objectives. We believe that a Cuba that subscribes to the purposes and standards of such fora will benefit, over time, from bringing its domestic economic and political practices in line with international norms and globally accepted standards. Our policy strengthens the U.S. position in international systems by removing an irritant from our relationships with our allies and partners and gaining support for a rules-based order.\nIII. Progress Toward United States-Cuba Normalization\nSince the United States announced on December 17, 2014, that it would chart a new course with Cuba, we have re-established diplomatic relations and have made progress toward the normalization of our bilateral relationship. We opened our respective embassies, six U.S. cabinet secretaries visited Havana, four Cuban ministers visited the United States, and I became the first sitting U.S. President to visit Cuba since 1928. We established a Bilateral Commission to prioritize areas of engagement, and we concluded non-binding arrangements on environmental protection, marine sanctuaries, public health and biomedical research, agriculture, counternarcotics, trade and travel security, civil aviation, direct transportation of mail, and hydrography. We launched dialogues or discussions on law enforcement cooperation, regulatory issues, economic issues, claims, and internet and telecommunications policy.\nGiven Cuba's proximity to the United States, increased engagement by U.S. citizens, companies, and the nongovernmental sector holds extraordinary promise for supporting our national interests. Bearing in mind the limits imposed by the Cuban Liberty and Democratic (LIBERTAD) Solidarity Act of 1996 (\"Libertad Act\") and other relevant statutes, the Departments of the Treasury and Commerce implemented six packages of regulatory amendments to the Cuba sanctions program, easing restrictions on travel, trade, and financial transactions. United States individuals, firms, and nongovernmental organizations are availing themselves of these regulatory changes to visit Cuba, and authorized travel to Cuba increased by more than 75 percent from 2014 to 2015. Future U.S. citizen travel will be supported by scheduled air service, which began in August 2016, and the first U.S. cruise liner visited Cuban ports in May 2016. We also commenced direct transportation of mail between our two countries, and U.S. telecommunications firms established direct voice and roaming agreements with Cuba. For its part, the Cuban government has continued to pursue incremental economic reforms and launched more than 100 public Wi-Fi hotspots across the island.\nThese developments lay the foundation for long-term engagement with Cuba that advances U.S. interests. But we have a great deal more to do to build on that foundation based on a realistic assessment of the strategic landscape surrounding normalization.\nIV. Strategic Landscape\nCuba is experiencing several transitions in areas such as leadership, the economy, technological development, civil society, and regional and global integration. Cuba's leaders recognize the need to transition to the next generation, but they prioritize gradual, incremental changes to ensure stability.\nCuba has important economic potential rooted in the dynamism of its people, as well as a sustained commitment in areas like education and health care. Yet the Cuban government faces significant economic challenges, including eliminating its dual-exchange-rate system, making its state-run enterprises more efficient and transparent, developing a financial system that provides expanded services to individuals and the private sector, and reducing its reliance on foreign subsidies. Cuba remains highly dependent on food and energy imports, yet must cope with limited sources of hard currency to pay for import needs. Significant emigration of working age Cubans further exacerbates Cuba's demographic problem of a rapidly aging population.\nA series of statutes limits U.S. economic engagement with Cuba, precluding a complete lifting of restrictions on U.S. travel to Cuba, prohibiting United States Government export assistance and the provision of U.S. credit for Cuban purchases of agricultural commodities, and requiring that the embargo not be suspended or terminated unless the President determines that a transition or democratically elected government has come to power in Cuba.\nDue to Cuba's legal, political, and regulatory constraints, its economy is not generating adequate foreign exchange to purchase U.S. exports that could flow from the easing of the embargo. Even if the U.S. Congress were to lift the embargo, Cubans would not realize their potential without continued economic reform in Cuba. Cuban government regulations and opaque procurement practices hamper transactions with U.S. companies that would be permitted under U.S. law.\nNormalization efforts have raised Cubans' expectations for greater economic opportunities. With an estimated 1 in 4 working Cubans engaged in entrepreneurship, a dynamic, independent private sector is emerging. Expansion of the private sector has increased resources for individual Cubans and created nascent openings for Cuban entrepreneurs to engage with U.S. firms and nongovernmental organizations. We take note of the Cuban government's limited, but meaningful steps to expand legal protections and opportunities for small- and medium-sized businesses, which, if expanded and sustained, will improve the investment climate.\nCuba is not a member of international financial institutions (IFIs), such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank, which could provide expertise and potentially finance economic reforms and viable investment projects.\nAlthough Cuba has reached agreement with several creditor nations on bilateral debt relief through restructuring and forgiveness, it remains in default to the United States Government on pre-Cuban revolution bilateral debts and does not participate in international capital markets. Cuba and the United States are both members of the World Trade Organization (WTO); however, neither country applies the agreement to the other because of the U.S. embargo toward Cuba.\nRapprochement has enabled us to increase our engagement with Cuba on regional issues such as the Colombia peace process and healthcare in Haiti, and has undermined an historic rallying point for regimes critical of the United States. Although Cuba has expressed no interest in participating in the OAS, it did attend the Summit of the Americas in 2015. We also welcome engagement between Cuba and other U.S. allies from around the world, including our European and Asian treaty allies. At the same time, we recognize that Cuba and the United States will continue to have differences on many regional and global issues.\nU.S. engagement with the Cuban government will also be constrained by Cuba's continued repression of civil and political liberties. We anticipate the Cuban government will continue to object to U.S. migration policies and operations, democracy programs, Radio and TV Marti, the U.S. presence at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Station, and the embargo. The United States Government has no intention to alter the existing lease treaty and other arrangements related to the Guantanamo Bay Naval Station, which enables the United States to enhance and preserve regional security.\nIn this strategic environment, the policies and actions the United States pursues to advance our vision for U.S.-Cuba normalization will significantly shape the future of bilateral and regional relations, as well as our shared security and prosperity.\nV. Six U.S. Objectives for the Medium-Term U.S.-Cuba Relationship\nTo advance the four end-state goals associated with our strategic vision for U.S.-Cuba normalization, the United States will move concurrently on the following six priority objectives:\n1. Government-to-Government Interaction\nWe will continue high-level and technical engagement in areas of mutual interest, including agriculture, the economy and small businesses, transportation, science and technology, environment, climate, health, law enforcement, migration, national security, disaster preparedness and response, and counterterrorism. Through the Bilateral Commission, we will identify and prioritize areas of collaboration and engagement that advance our end-state goals. Stronger diplomatic ties will enable constructive engagement on bilateral differences, including our democracy and broadcasting programs, while protecting our interests and assets, such as the Guantanamo Bay Naval Station. We will utilize engagement to urge Cuba to make demonstrable progress on human rights and religious freedom. As the United States and Cuban governments build trust through more frequent engagement, we will increasingly conduct working-level interactions between Cuban ministries and U.S. agencies and departments that lessen the need for high-level conversations on routine matters. Given the lack of diplomatic relations over the past several decades, we will seek broad engagement across the Cuban government, including ministries and local officials. When appropriate and legally available, we will engage with Cuba to normalize trade relations fully.\n2. Engagement and Connectivity\nThe United States will continue to encourage people-to-people linkages through government and privately sponsored exchanges, including those involving educational, cultural, business, science, environment, technology, and sports. As permitted by law, we will continue to support the development of scheduled and chartered air service and maritime links, including ferries. An ongoing partnership with the Cuban-American community is of particular importance given Cuban-Americans' strong family and socio-cultural ties, as well as their natural role as citizen-ambassadors. We will facilitate opportunities for Cuban-Americans to rebuild and create new bonds with family to support reconciliation. To facilitate Cuba's goal of increasing its internet access from 5 percent to 50 percent of the population by 2020, we will seek the establishment of a bilateral working group to expand internet connectivity. We will seek opportunities that enable U.S. foundations and universities to establish linkages with Cuba. 3. Expanded Commerce\nThe United States Government will seek to expand opportunities for U.S. companies to engage with Cuba. The embargo is outdated and should be lifted. My Administration has repeatedly called upon the Congress to lift the embargo, and we will continue to work toward that goal. While the embargo remains in place, our role will be to pursue policies that enable authorized U.S. private sector engagement with Cuba's emerging private sector and with state-owned enterprises that provide goods and services to the Cuban people. Law enforcement cooperation will ensure that authorized commerce and authorized travelers move rapidly between the United States and Cuba. Although we recognize the priority given to state-owned enterprises in the Cuban model, we seek to encourage reforms that align these entities with international norms, especially transparency.\nUnited States regulatory changes have created space for the Cuban government to introduce comparable changes. In tandem with the Department of the Treasury's regulatory change to expand Cuba's access to the U.S. financial system and U.S. dollar transit accounts, the Cuban government announced in early 2016 plans to eliminate the 10 percent penalty on U.S. dollar conversion transactions, subject to improved access to the international banking system. We will sustain private and public efforts to explain our regulatory changes to U.S. firms and banks, Cuban entrepreneurs, and the Cuban government.\n4. Economic Reform\nWhile the Cuban government pursues its economic goals based on its national priorities, we will utilize our expanded cooperation to support further economic reforms by the Cuban government. Recent exchanges among financial service institutions and regulators have provided greater mutual understanding of our respective financial system and economic priorities. We will undertake government-to-government dialogues to discuss options for macro- and microeconomic reform, with the goal of connecting the changes in U.S. policy with Cuban reforms in a manner that creates opportunity for U.S. firms and the Cuban people.\nIf and when the Congress lifts the embargo, my Administration will engage with the Congress and stakeholders on preparatory commercial and economic exchanges and dialogues. My Administration would then similarly engage the Congress on the substance and timing of a new bilateral commercial agreement to address remaining statutory trade requirements.\n5. Respect for Universal Human Rights, Fundamental Freedoms, and Democratic Values\nWe will not pursue regime change in Cuba. We will continue to make clear that the United States cannot impose a different model on Cuba because the future of Cuba is up to the Cuban people. We seek greater Cuban government respect for universal human rights and fundamental freedoms for every individual. Progress in this area will have a positive impact on the other objectives. We will encourage the Cuban government to respect human rights; support Cuba's emerging, broad-based civil society; and encourage partners and nongovernmental actors to join us in advocating for reforms. While remaining committed to supporting democratic activists as we do around the world, we will also engage community leaders, bloggers, activists, and other social issue leaders who can contribute to Cuba's internal dialogue on civic participation. We will continue to pursue engagements with civil society through the U.S. Embassy in Havana and during official United States Government visits to Cuba. We will seek to institutionalize a regular human rights dialogue with the Cuban government to advance progress on human rights. We will pursue democracy programming that is transparent and consistent with programming in other similarly situated societies around the world. We will utilize our increased ability to engage regional partners, both bilaterally and through regional bodies, to encourage respect for human rights in Cuba. We will consult with nongovernmental actors such as the Catholic Church and other religious institutions. Finally, we will work with the European Union and likeminded international organizations and countries to encourage the Cuban government to respect universal values.\n6. Cuban Integration into International and Regional Systems\nWe will expand dialogue with Cuba in the organizations in which it already holds membership, such as the WTO and the World Customs Organization (WCO), and we will encourage Cuba to move toward rules-based engagement, subject to statutory requirements. We will encourage Cuba to bring its legal framework, particularly its commercial law, in line with international standards. We will encourage Cuba to meet WCO standards for supply chain security. To the extent permitted by and consistent with applicable law, we will facilitate integration into international bodies, including through the use of technical assistance programs. We will pursue cooperation with Cuba on regional and global issues (e.g., combating the Ebola outbreak and the Colombia peace process). Ending the embargo and satisfying other statutory requirements relating to trade will allow the United States to normalize trade relations with Cuba.\nVI. Policy Implementation\n1. Roles and Responsibilities\nTo facilitate the effective implementation of this directive, departments and agencies will have the following roles and responsibilities, consistent with the relevant legal authorities and limits:\nThe National Security Council (NSC) staff will provide ongoing policy coordination and oversight of the implementation of this PPD and the overall Cuba strategy as necessary.\nThe Department of State will continue to be responsible for formulation of U.S. policy toward and coordination of relations with Cuba. This includes supporting the operations of Embassy Havana and ensuring it has adequate resources and staffing. Other responsibilities include the issuance of nonimmigrant and immigrant visas, refugee processing, promotion of educational and cultural exchanges, coordination of democracy programs, and political and economic reporting. State will continue to lead the U.S.-Cuba Bilateral Commission and coordinate a number of dialogues, such as the Law Enforcement Dialogue, annual migration talks, and meetings to resolve outstanding claims. State will continue to co-lead efforts with the U.S. Agency for International Development to ensure democracy programming is transparent and consistent with programming in other similarly situated societies. State will coordinate efforts to advance science and technology cooperation with Cuba. State will support telecommunications and internet access growth in Cuba and provide foreign policy guidance to the Departments of Commerce and the Treasury on certain exports, financial transactions, and other license applications.\nThe U.S. Mission to the United Nations (USUN), in coordination with State, will oversee multilateral issues involving Cuba at the United Nations. USUN will identify areas of possible collaboration with Cuba that could help foster a more collaborative relationship between the United States and Cuba at the United Nations. The USUN will also participate in discussions regarding the annual Cuban embargo resolution at the United Nations, as our bilateral relationship continues to develop in a positive trajectory. The Department of the Treasury is responsible for implementation of the economic embargo restrictions and licensing policies. The Treasury will continue its outreach to help the public, businesses, and financial institutions understand the regulatory changes. The Treasury will continue to review and respond to public questions and feedback on regulations and public guidance that could be further clarified and to discuss with State any novel license requests that the Treasury receives from the public to determine whether such requests are consistent with the regulatory changes and existing law. The Treasury will make use of available channels for bilateral dialogue to understand Cuba's economic and financial system and encourage reforms and will continue to engage in dialogue with the Cuban government about our regulatory changes.\nThe Department of Commerce will continue to support the development of the Cuban private sector, entrepreneurship, commercial law development, and intellectual property rights as well as environmental protection and storm prediction. If statutory restrictions are lifted, Commerce will promote increased trade with Cuba by providing export assistance to U.S. companies. In the meantime, Commerce will continue a robust outreach effort to ensure that U.S. companies understand that U.S. regulatory changes provide new opportunities to obtain licenses or use license exceptions to increase authorized exports to Cuba, including to Cuban state-owned enterprises that provide goods and services to meet the needs of the Cuban people. Additionally, Commerce will continue to engage in dialogue with the Cuban government about our regulatory changes, as well as the need for simplification of the Cuban import process, transparency in Cuban business regulations, and other steps that will lead to full realization of the benefits of our regulatory changes.\nThe Department of Defense (DOD) will continue to take steps to expand the defense relationship with Cuba where it will advance U.S. interests, with an initial focus on humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and counternarcotics in the Caribbean. The DOD will support Cuba's inclusion in the inter-American defense system and regional security and defense conferences, which will give Cuba a stake in hemispheric stability. The DOD will continue to make contingency preparations and support the capacity of the Department of Homeland Security and State to address mass migration and maritime migration issues pursuant to Executive Orders 12807 and 13276 and consistent with other applicable interagency guidance and strategy.\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will engage, together with the Department of Justice, with the Cuban government to combat terrorism and transnational organized crime. In support of U.S. security and foreign policy objectives, DHS will develop protocols for investigative cooperation with Cuba in coordination with other departments and agencies. The DHS will strengthen the security and efficiency of cross-border supply chains and travel systems in support of people-to-people engagement and authorized U.S. trade with the Cuban private sector. The DHS will safeguard the integrity of the U.S. immigration system, to include the facilitation of lawful immigration and ensure protection of refugees. The Secretary of Homeland Security, the United States Government lead for a maritime migration or mass migration, with support from the Secretaries of State and Defense, will address a maritime migration or mass migration pursuant to Executive Orders 12807 and 13276 and consistent with applicable interagency guidance and strategy.\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) will engage, together with DHS, with the Cuban government to combat terrorism and transnational organized crime. The DOJ will work with Cuba to expand security and law enforcement cooperation, increase information sharing, and share best practices with Cuban counterparts. This work will build upon, and strengthen, current law enforcement cooperation with Cuba under the umbrella of the U.S.-Cuba Law Enforcement Dialogue and its various working groups, which focus on counterterrorism, counternarcotics, cybercrime, human trafficking, and other areas of criminal activity.\nThe Small Business Administration (SBA) will continue to engage with the Cuban government, entrepreneurs, small businesses, and cooperative enterprises. The SBA will support exchanges with the Cuban government in areas of mutual interest, particularly on formalization of small businesses and to spur the growth of new enterprises.\nThe Office of the United States Trade Representative will provide trade policy coordination in international fora and, consistent with statutory requirements and restrictions, prepare for negotiations to normalize and expand U.S.-Cuba trade.\nThe Department of Agriculture (USDA) will work to increase U.S. food and agricultural exports to Cuba by building market opportunities, improving the competitive position of U.S. agriculture, and building Cuba's food security and agricultural capacity, while protecting plant, animal, and human health. USDA will work with the Government of Cuba to advance cooperation outlined in the U.S.-Cuba agricultural memorandum of understanding signed in March 2016. The USDA will build the U.S.-Cuba trade and development relationship to the extent permitted by and consistent with applicable law.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), in accordance with the June 2016 memorandum of understanding between HHS and the Ministry of Public Health of the Republic of Cuba, will collaborate with Cuban counterparts in the areas of public health, research, and biomedical sciences, including collaboration to confront the Zika virus, dengue, chikungunya, and other arboviruses. The HHS will promote joint work, such as development of vaccines, treatments, and diagnostics; partner with Cuba to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease outbreaks; collaborate in the field of cancer control, treatment programs, and joint research; and exchange best practices related to access to healthcare.\nThe United States Agency for International Development (USAID) will coordinate with departments and agencies the United States Government's response to unplanned environmental occurrences, such as natural or manmade disasters. The USAID will co-lead efforts with State to ensure that democracy programming is transparent and consistent with programming in other similarly situated societies.\nThe Department of Transportation (DOT) will continue to develop air and surface transportation links between the United States and Cuba in support of transportation providers, authorized travelers, and commerce, while providing required regulatory and safety oversight of transportation providers and systems.\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) will support broader United States Government efforts to normalize relations with Cuba, with Intelligence Community elements working to find opportunities for engagement on areas of common interest through which we could exchange information on mutual threats with Cuban counterparts.\nThe Department of the Interior (DOI) will continue cooperation with Cuba on marine protected areas and continue to engage Cuban counterparts to finalize arrangements on wildlife conservation, terrestrial national protected areas, and seismic records.\n2. Congressional Outreach Strong support in the Congress for U.S.-Cuba normalization would contribute to the speed and success of the aforementioned goals, particularly with respect to the embargo and adequate embassy staffing. We will seek to build support in the Congress to lift the embargo and other statutory constraints to enable expanded travel and commerce with Cuba and accelerate normalization. We will regularly engage with Members of Congress and staff on challenges and opportunities in Cuba, advocate for United States Government policies and sufficient staff and resources to implement the aforementioned goals and policy priorities, and encourage and facilitate congressional travel to the region.\n3. Monitoring and Oversight\nThe Interagency Policy Committee (IPC), or its future equivalent, will have primary responsibility for coordinating and overseeing the implementation of this policy. The NSC staff will convene regular IPC and Deputies Committee meetings as necessary to monitor implementation and resolve obstacles to progress. The following departments and agencies will designate senior individuals responsible for managing policy implementation in their agency: State, the Treasury, Commerce, DOD (Office of the Secretary of Defense and Joint Staff), DHS, DOJ, USDA, HHS, DOT, USUN, the Office of the United States Trade Representative, USAID, SBA, and DNI.\n4. Previous Guidance\nExecutive Order 13276, Delegation of Responsibilities Concerning Undocumented Aliens Interdicted or Intercepted in the Caribbean Region, dated November 15, 2002, and Executive Order 12807, Interdiction of Illegal Aliens, dated May 24, 1992, remain in effect.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-10-14", "title": "Directive on United States-Cuba Normalization"}

This directive takes a comprehensive and whole-of-Government approach to promote engagement with the Cuban Government and people and make our opening to Cuba irreversible.\nIn December 2014, following more than 50 years of failed policy, I announced that the United States would begin a process of normalizing relations with Cuba. Since then, we've worked with the people and the Government of Cuba to do exactly that: reestablishing diplomatic relations, opening Embassies, expanding travel and commerce, and launching initiatives to help our people cooperate and innovate. This new directive consolidates and builds upon the changes we've already made, promotes transparency by being clear about our policy and intentions, and encourages further engagement between our countries and our people.\nConsistent with this approach, the Departments of Treasury and Commerce issued further regulatory changes today, building on the progress made over the last 2 years, to continue to facilitate more interaction between the Cuban and American people, including through travel and commercial opportunities, and more access to information. This follows previous changes that helped facilitate interconnectivity between our peoples and to promote economic reforms on the island by providing access to the dollar in international transactions. These changes are representative of the progress I saw firsthand when I visited Havana to personally extend a hand of friendship to the Cuban people. The quick flight over 90 miles of blue water belied the real barriers of the past that were crossed that day, but my interactions with everyday Cubans told a promising story of neighbors working to build broader ties of cooperation across the Americas.\nChallenges remain—and very real differences between our governments persist on issues of democracy and human rights—but I believe that engagement is the best way to address those differences and make progress on behalf of our interests and values. The progress of the last 2 years, bolstered by today's action, should remind the world of what's possible when we look to the future together.", "timestamp": "2016-10-14", "title": "Statement on United States-Cuba Normalization"}

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "note": "As prepared for delivery.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119172", "text": "Thank you.\nIn 24 days, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.\nWe are going to deliver real change that puts America First.\nWe are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, lift the restrictions on American energy, end common core, reduce the cost of college, make childcare more affordable, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.\nYour jobs will come back under a Trump Administration. Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration. Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration. Your companies won't be leaving our country under a Trump Administration.\nWe are going to be a rich country again.\nWe are also going to end government corruption. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the Presidency – and the media, donors and special interests who support her will do everything they can to cling to their power and prestige at your expense.\nThe Hillary Clinton documents released by WikiLeaks make more clear than ever just how much is at stake in this election.\nThe documents show the Clinton Campaign colluding with the State Department and Justice Department over the investigation into Hillary's illegal email server that put your family and your country in danger.\nThey show how the Clintons ripped off the people of Haiti.\nThey show the Clinton Campaign viciously attacking Catholics and Evangelicals.\nThey also show how the media collaborates and conspires directly with the Clinton Campaign.\nTo cover-up her crimes, Hillary Clinton deleted 33,000 emails – after a Congressional Subpoena – she lied to Congress under oath, she made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer, and now we learn 2 boxes of evidence mysteriously went missing.\nHillary Clinton should have been prosecuted, and gone to jail for her crimes. The FBI and the Department of Justice created a fraud in allowing Hillary Clinton to get away with her terrible crimes – and I guarantee you, the Clintons are laughing at them. The Director's performance in Congress, coupled with Bill Clinton's clandestine meeting on the tarmac in the Attorney General's airplane just prior to decision-time on Hillary – supposedly talking about golf and grandchildren – is perhaps the lowest point in those department's history.\nInstead of being held accountable, Hillary is running for President in what looks like a rigged election. The election is being rigged by corrupt media, pushing completely false allegations and outright lies, in an effort to elect her President.\nBut we are going to stop it. We are not going to back down. We are not going to let it happen. We are just getting started.\nAmericans have had it with the years, the decades, of Clinton Corruption. They get rich stealing your jobs and shipping them to other countries.\nThis will finally be the year the American people say: Enough is Enough.\nSpeaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally \"open trade and open borders.\"\nBy \"open trade,\" she means foreign countries can cheat us out of millions of jobs and trillions of dollars.\nBy \"open borders,\" she means totally unlimited immigration.\nWhen she thought no one was listening, Hillary Clinton was plotting to destroy the sovereignty of the United States.\nEither we win the election, or we lose the country.\nA Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes, we will build a wall.\nA wall will not only keep out dangerous cartels and criminals, but it will also keep out the drugs and heroin poisoning our youth.\nWhen I won the New Hampshire primary, I promised the people of New Hampshire that I would stop drugs from pouring into your communities. I am now doubling-down on that promise, and can guarantee you – we will not only stop the drugs from pouring in, but we will help all of those people so seriously addicted get the assistance they need to unchain themselves.\nNew Hampshire has one of the highest drug overdose death rates in the country.\nWe have to solve this crisis.\nI have to give credit to my running mate, Mike Pence, on this issue.\nMike increased the mandatory minimum sentences for the most serious drug offenders, while expanding access to treatment and prevention options for those struggling with addiction.\nWe must make similar efforts a priority for the nation.\nNot too long ago we read about Christopher Honor and Courtney Griffin -- a young Rockingham County couple who died of an overdose within a year of each other. Their story of prescription drugs, heroin, wait times for treatment, and missed opportunity in the court system are a tragic reminder of why we need a plan to end the opioid epidemic.\nFirst, we will stop the flow of illegal drugs into the country.\nThe number of heroin seizures on the border has tripled since 2008.\nI've received the first-ever endorsement of our Border Patrol and ICE officers, and under a Trump Administration, we will work with them to end the flow of drugs across our border for good.\nWe are also going to put an end to Sanctuary Cities, which refuse to turn over illegal immigrant drug traffickers for deportation.\nWe will dismantle the illegal immigrant cartels and violent gangs, and we will send them swiftly out of our country.\nWe will aggressively prosecute traffickers of illegal drugs, and provide law enforcement and prosecutors with the resources and support they need to do their jobs.\nPresident Obama has commuted the sentences of record numbers of high level drug traffickers, many of them kingpins, and violent armed traffickers with extensive criminal histories. Hillary Clinton promises to continue and expand this approach, turning our streets back over to gangs, drug cartels, and armed career criminals.\nOver the last few years this administration has been steadily dismantling the federal criminal justice system. Tens of thousands of drug dealers have been released from prison early, including many illegal immigrants--regardless of their history of violence, or ties to transnational gangs and cartels.\nSecond, we will close the shipping loopholes that China and others are exploiting to send dangerous drugs across our borders in the hands of our own postal service.\nThese traffickers use loopholes in the Postal Service to mail fentanyl and other drugs to users and dealers in the U.S.\nA Trump administration will crack down on this abuse, and give law enforcement the tools they need to accomplish this mission.\nThird, we will fix the misguided rules and regulations that have made this problem worse.\nIt is tragedy enough that so many Americans are struggling with life-threatening addiction. We should not compound that tragedy with government policies and bureaucratic rules that make it even harder for them to get help.\nThe FDA has been far too slow to approve abuse-deterring drugs. And when the FDA has approved these medications, the rules have been far too restrictive, severely limiting the number of authorized prescribers as well as the number of patients each doctor can treat.\nRecovery medications have the potential to save thousands and thousands of lives. We prescribe opioids like Oxycontin freely, but when patients become addicted to those drugs, we stop doctors from giving patients the treatments they medically need.\nAs president, I'd work to lift the cap on the number of patients that doctors can treat, provided they follow safe prescribing practices and proper treatment supervision.\nAt the same time, DEA should reduce the amount of Schedule II opioids (drugs like oxycodone, methadone and fentanyl) that can be made and sold in the U.S. We have 5 percent of the world's population, but use 80 percent of the prescription opioids.\nFinally, we will give people struggling with addiction access to the help they need.\nCongress has already taken the first step by passing the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. This legislation is an important step.\nI would also expand incentives for states and local governments to use drug courts and mandated treatment. These can be a cost effective, appropriate, and humane response to addiction.\nI would dramatically expand access to treatment slots and end Medicaid policies that obstruct inpatient treatment.\nI would dramatically expand first responders' and caregivers' access to Narcan, an antidote that treats overdoses and saves thousands of lives.\nI would also restore accountability to our Veterans Administration. Too many of our brave veterans have been prescribed these dangerous and addictive drugs by a VA that should have been paying them better attention.\nTogether, these steps will ensure that every American struggling with addiction has access to the care and the help that he or she needs.\nBut, if we are going to bring hope back to our communities, we not only have to solve our drug crisis but our economic crisis.\nThe wealth has been raided from our country, leaving behind dilapidated communities, rusted out factories, and shattered dreams.\nAt the center of our economic revival will be fixing our terrible trade deals.\n47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps.\nWe have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world, and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.\nThis is the legacy of Obama-Clinton.\nThe state of New Hampshire has lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton.\nSince China entered the World Trade Organization – another Bill and Hillary-backed deal – 70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States.\nThat's 15 factories closing a day, on average.\nWe are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.\nCompanies like Carrier, General Electric, Motorola, Mattel, Fiat\nChrysler, and so many others are moving their jobs to Mexico.\nRight here in New Hampshire, I visited the Osram Sylvania plant that closed its doors in 2014 and shipped its jobs to China and Mexico.\nIf I win, day one, we are going to announce our plans to renegotiate NAFTA. If we don't get the deal we want, we'll leave NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal.\nWe are going to start making things in America again.\nAs part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we are going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent.\nWe will have a 10% tax on money parked overseas, bringing trillions in wealth back into our country.\nManufacturers will be able to expense the cost of new investment and equipment, to help make our country more competitive.\nWe will lower taxes massively on all Americans – Hillary will raise your taxes massively.\nWe will become the great jobs magnet of the world.\nWages will rise, jobs will return, and factories will come rushing onto our shores.\nHere are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:\nWe are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; defend religious liberty; reduce the cost of tuition; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; repeal and replace Obamacare; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\nYou have 24 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true.\nOn November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.\nI am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation – and I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\nYou're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like you've never seen before. We're going to make history together. You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote I've ever cast for anyone at any time.\nOnce again, we are going to have a government of, by and for the people.\nWe will make America wealthy again.\nWe will make America strong again.\nWe will make America safe again.\nAnd we are going to make America great again.", "timestamp": "2016-10-15", "title": "Remarks at the Cross Insurance Center in Bangor, Maine"}

Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration. Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration. Your energy bills will go way down under a Trump Administration. Your companies won't be leaving Maine under a Trump Administration.\nWe are going to be a rich country again.\nWe are also going to end government corruption.\nHillary speaks in secret to Goldman Sachs – her private position – then lies to you, the public, with her public position. It's all a fraud.\nHillary Clinton deleted 33,000 emails – after a Congressional Subpoena – she lied to Congress under oath, she made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer, and now we learn 2 boxes of email evidence mysteriously went missing.\nHillary Clinton should have been prosecuted, and gone to jail for her crimes. The FBI and the Department of Justice created a fraud in allowing Hillary Clinton to get away with her terrible crimes – and I guarantee you, the Clintons are laughing at them. The Director's performance in Congress, coupled with Bill Clinton's clandestine meeting on the tarmac in the Attorney General's airplane just prior to decision-time on Hillary – supposedly talking about golf and grandchildren – is perhaps the lowest point in those department's history.\nInstead of being held accountable, Hillary is running for President in what looks like a rigged election. The election is being rigged by corrupt media, pushing false allegations and outright lies, in an effort to elect her President.\nBut we are going to stop it. We are not going to back down. We are not going to let it happen.\nWe have only just begun to fight.\nAmericans have had it with the years, the decades, of Clinton Corruption. This will finally be the year the American people say: Enough is Enough.\nSpeaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally \"open trade and open borders.\" Hillary and Bill raise millions of dollars from global interest groups who have no allegiance to this country or its workers.\nBy \"open trade,\" she means foreign countries can cheat us out of millions of jobs and trillions of dollars.\nBy \"open borders,\" she means totally unlimited immigration.\nEither we win the election, or we lose the country.\nHillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East – meaning generations of radicalism within our shores. She wants us to follow the path of France and Germany and import terrorism directly into the United States.\nSo let me state this as clearly as I can. If I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.\nWe will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration.\nA Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes, we will build a wall.\nWe have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers.\nIt was just reported that a man deported from our country 10 times in six years has been charged with raping a 12-year old girl. In August, Texas Police arrested a serial illegal immigrant rapist who had been deported five times, including one 68 year-old woman with a cane who took his offer to drive her home. He left her on the side of a dirt road.\nWhat kind of government allows its own people to suffer such horrors?\nAs Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released because their home countries wouldn't take them back. Among those she allowed to go free was a criminal alien who had previously been convicted for shooting a girl in the head – after his release, he viciously murdered a young girl name Casey Chadwick.\nA wall will not only keep out criminals, but it will also keep out the drugs and heroin poisoning our youth.\nDrugs overdoses in Maine are on a record pace.\nI have outlined a plan to stop the opioid crisis. My plan begins with a strong border, includes the prosecution of drug dealers, and dramatically expands access to life-saving treatments that will help people unchain themselves from this terrible addiction.\nBut, if we are going to bring hope back to suffering Americans, we must also solve our jobs crisis.\nAt the center of our economic revival will be fixing our terrible trade deals.\n47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps.\nWe have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world, and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.\nThis is the legacy of Obama-Clinton.\nWhen I am President, everything will change. We will move people from the welfare rolls to the employment rolls. We will end our chronic trade deficits. We will start growing again.\nWe'll rebuild our roads, schools, bridges, tunnels, railways, hospitals and airports.\nThe state of Maine has lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton.\nSince China entered the World Trade Organization – another Bill and Hillary-backed deal – 70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States.\nThat's 15 factories closing a day, on average.\nWe are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.\nIf I win, day one, we are going to announce our plans to renegotiate NAFTA.

Our biggest reductions will be for the working and middle class – this includes letting parents deduct the cost of childcare.\nReagan's tax cuts in the eighties, and Kennedy's tax cuts in the sixties, brought us tremendous growth. My economic reforms – on taxes, trade, regulation and American energy – will produce at least 25 million newjobs in a decade. It's the most pro-growth economic plan in American history.\nWe are also going to protect the right of the people of Maine to use their own land.\nPresident Obama, with the support of politicians like Hillary Clinton, issued an executive order 2 months ago making over 87,000 acres in Maine into a new \"National Monument.\" No consideration was made for local concerns, impacts to jobs, or the Maine forestry sector. No approval by Congress. Your state legislature opposed it. It is just another federal overreach that is going to do more harm than good. Obama and Clinton don't care that this area badly needs jobs and growth and that this decision -- done at the stroke of the pen without the support of the local community-- undermines the people that live and work here in Maine.\nBut we are going to turn it all around. America's comeback begins on November 8th.\nHere are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:\nWe are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; defend religious liberty; reduce the cost of tuition; provide school choice to every low-income child in America; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; support the men and women of law enforcement; repeal and replace Obamacare; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\nYou have 24 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true.\nOn November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.\nI am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation.\nI'm going to fight for every child living in poverty. I'm going to fight for every mom whose lost her child to illegal immigration, and drugs and gang violence.\nI'm going to fight for every worker who deserves a raise, and for every community whose jobs and dreams have been ripped out and shipped to other countries.\nI'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people – not the donors.\nI'm going to fight for every patriotic citizen that Hillary Clinton slanders as deplorable and irredeemable – and I am going to be a President for all of our citizens.\nI am going to fight to bring us together as Americans.\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\nYou're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122644", "text": "Today, in another major milestone for international climate action, nearly 200 countries reached an agreement to phase down the potent greenhouse gases known as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). At the 28th Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol in Kigali, Rwanda, countries adopted an amendment to phase down HFCs, committing to cut the production and consumption of HFCs by more than 80 percent over the next 30 years. This global deal will avoid more than 80 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2050 – equivalent to more than a decade of emissions from the entire U.S. economy – and could avoid up to 0.5°C of warming by the end of the century. It reflects a significant contribution towards achieving the Paris Agreement goal to limit global temperature rise to well below 2°C. Today's accomplishment follows years of engagement and leadership by the Obama Administration and our partners towards adopting an amendment and provides further momentum to global efforts to address climate change.\nThe Montreal Protocol is the international agreement designed to protect the ozone layer by phasing out the production and consumption of numerous substances that are responsible for ozone depletion, many of which are also potent greenhouse gases, and it is considered by many to be the most successful environmental treaty in history. While the Montreal Protocol successfully phased out ozone-depleting substances and put the ozone layer on the path to a full recovery, it led to a shift towards HFCs. Like the substances they replaced, HFCs are potent greenhouse gases that can be hundreds to thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide in contributing to climate change. HFCs are used in numerous applications, including refrigeration and air conditioning. As safer chemicals continue to be developed, they can replace HFCs in these uses. If left unchecked, global HFC emissions could grow to be equivalent to 19 percent of total carbon dioxide emissions in 2050 under a business-as-usual scenario. However, today's amendment will prevent that from happening by ensuring that countries begin to phase down HFCs starting in 2019, with subsequent reductions on a clear timeline that will lead to more than an 80 percent reduction in HFCs globally by 2047.\nKey Elements of the Montreal Protocol Amendment to Address HFCs\n•      Innovative and Flexible Structure: The amendment will lead to strong near-term action, with phasedown obligations for all countries: starting with a 2024 freeze for the vast majority of Article 5 Parties (i.e., developing countries that meet certain criteria, including China) and a first reduction in 2019 for most Article 2 Parties (i.e., all other countries, including the United States).\n•      Ambitious Phasedown Schedule: The amendment establishes a rapid pathway for the phasedown, with most Article 2 Parties reducing HFCs by 10 percent by 2019 and by 85 percent by 2036 relative to production and consumption levels in 2011-2013. The vast majority of Article 5 Parties – including China and Latin American, African, and island nations – will follow soon after on a similar trajectory, with a freeze by 2024 and then ultimately a reduction of 80 percent by 2045 relative to production and consumption levels in 2020-2022. In addition, Parties came together to accommodate the national circumstances of a small number of countries by agreeing to flexibilities to meet the demands of a global HFC phasedown. This small group of countries will freeze their consumption by 2028.\n•      Incentive for Earlier Action: A group of donor countries and philanthropists announced last month their intent to provide $80 million in support to help Article 5 countries take early action to implement an ambitious amendment and improve energy efficiency. These funds will be provided to Article 5 countries that have chosen the freeze date of 2024.\n•      Broad Participation: The Montreal Protocol was the first treaty in the history of the United Nations to achieve universal ratification, and we expect such broad participation to continue under the amendment to address HFCs. Today's agreement was reached by consensus, and its provisions that restrict trade in HFCs with non-Parties will act as a powerful incentive for all countries to join.\n•      Enforcement and Accountability: The Montreal Protocol's accountability processes ensure regular reporting and robust review, and its efforts to help countries facing implementation problems come into compliance has historically enabled all countries to achieve the reductions agreed.\n•      Multiple Opportunities to Increase Ambition: The amendment calls for periodic reviews every five years, during which a technical panel will assess the pace of technology development and adoption in affected sectors in order to allow countries to consider phasedown commitments and any needed adjustments. Such periodic reviews represent opportunities to ratchet up ambition. Indeed, the Montreal Protocol has been adjusted several times to accelerate the phaseout of ozone-depleting substances. In addition, experience shows that once the world begins a transition away from polluting substances, many countries are actually able to go faster relative to the originally scheduled reductions.\nToday's amendment builds on strong action on HFCs that the United States has already taken domestically. Notably, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has finalized two rules under its Significant New Alternatives Policy program to prohibit the use of certain HFCs where safer and more climate-friendly alternatives are available. In parallel, EPA has also listed as acceptable additional climate-friendly alternatives to expand the options for businesses to use, and has finalized a rule that strengthens existing refrigerant management rules for ozone-depleting refrigerants and applies those same requirements to HFCs. In addition, the White House has held two summits at which private-sector commitments to reduce the use and emissions of HFCs were announced. Taken together, the private-sector commitments and executive actions announced to date will slash U.S. reliance on HFCs and reduce cumulative global consumption of these greenhouse gases by the equivalent of more than 1 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent through 2025.", "timestamp": "2016-10-15", "title": "Fact Sheet: Nearly 200 Countries Reach a Global Deal to Phase Down Potent Greenhouse Gases and Avoid Up to 0.5°C of Warming"}

On Thursday, I traveled to Pittsburgh for the White House Frontiers Conference, where some of America's leading minds came together to talk about how we can empower our people through science to lead our communities, our country, and our world into tomorrow.\nPlus, we had some fun. I had a chance to fly a space flight simulator where I docked a capsule on the International Space Station. I met a young man who'd been paralyzed for more than a decade, but thanks to breakthrough brain implants, today, he can not only move a prosthetic arm, but actually feel with the fingers.\nIt's awe-inspiring stuff. And it shows how investing in science and technology spurs our country towards new jobs and new industries, new discoveries that improve and save lives. That's always been our country's story, from a Founding Father with an idea to fly a kite in a thunderstorm, to the women who solved the equations to take us into space, to the engineers who brought us the Internet. Innovation is in our DNA. And today, we need it more than ever to solve the challenges we face. Only through science can we cure diseases and save the only planet we've got and ensure that America keeps its competitive advantages as the world's most innovative economy.\nAnd that's why it's so backward when some folks choose to stick their heads in the sand about basic scientific facts. It's not just that they're saying that climate change is a hoax or trotting out a snowball on the Senate floor. It's that they're also doing everything they can to gut funding for research and development, the kinds of investments that brought us breakthroughs like GPS and MRIs and put Siri on our smartphones.\nThat's not who we are. Remember, 60 years ago, when the Russians beat us into space, we didn't deny Sputnik was up there. We didn't haggle over the facts or shrink our R&D budget. No, we built a space program almost overnight and beat them to the Moon. And then, we kept going, becoming the first country to take an up-close look at every planet in the solar system too. That's who we are.\nAnd that's why, in my first Inaugural Address, I vowed to return science to its rightful place. It's why in our first few months, we made the largest single investment in basic research in our history. And it's why, over the last 8 years, we've modernized the Government's approach to innovation for the 21st century. We've jumpstarted a clean energy revolution and unleashed the potential of precision medicine. We've partnered with the private sector and academia and launched moonshots for cancer, brain research, and solar energy. We've harnessed big data to foster social innovation and invested in STEM education and computer science so that every young person—no matter where they come from or what they look like—can reach their potential and help us win the future.\nThat's what this is about: making sure that America is the nation that leads the world into the next frontier. And that's why I've been so committed to science and innovation, because I'll always believe that with the right investments and the brilliance and ingenuity of the American people, there's nothing we cannot do.\nThanks, everybody.

The plan provides financing to countries in need so that new air conditioning and refrigeration technology can be available for their citizens.

In addition to today's amendment, countries last week crossed the threshold for the Paris Agreement to enter into force and reached a deal to constrain international aviation emissions.

Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration. Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration. Your companies won't be leaving Wisconsin under a Trump Administration.\nWe are also going to end government corruption.\nHillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to run for President.\nNewly-released FBI documents made public today reveal just how deep the corruption goes. The under-Secretary of State, Patrick Kennedy, pressured the FBI to un-classify emails from Hillary's illegal server. In other words, the State Department was trying to cover-up Hillary's crime of sending classified information on a server our enemies could easily access by trying to reverse the classification.\nThis is a criminal conspiracy – a conspiracy that included Hillary's deleting and bleaching of 33,000 emails, the disappearance of 13 phones, 2 boxes of email evidence gone missing, and the destruction of laptops in a secret deal with the FBI.\nRemember, also, that Hillary lied under oath to Congress saying she had never sent or received classified information on her insecure sever, and pretended not to know that the letter \"C\" meant confidential information that was classified. Hillary then told the FBI she couldn't remember 39 times, and then, in written testimony last week under oath, said she couldn't remember another 21 times.\nWe are witnessing a criminal enterprise that has turned our government into a vehicle for the Clinton's personal profit at your expense.\nBut it gets even worse.\nThe FBI documents show that Under-Secretary of State Patrick Kennedy made the request for altering classification as part of a \"quid pro quo.\" This is felony corruption. Under-Secretary Kennedy needs to resign.\nClinton cronies have sacrificed your security, your family's safety, and your country's safety as though it meant nothing at all.\nThis is magnitudes worse than Watergate. And we're going to put an end to it on November 8th.\nBut there's still more. Another series of emails shows top officials in the Clinton campaign scheming to take massive sums of money from foreign lobbyists. One of the emails from a top Hillary official said, quote, \"take the money!!\" with two exclamation points. This is money bundled by people registered as lobbyists on behalf of foreign governments.\nRemember, we are competing in a rigged election – the media is trying to rig the election by giving credence to false stories that have no validity and making it front page news, only to poison the minds of the American voters. The media is an extension of the Clinton Campaign, as WikiLeaks proved – Hillary even got the questions and answers in advance of a major debate.\nA new report from the Center for Public Integrity shows that 96% of so-called journalists and reporters who donated this cycle gave their money to Hillary Clinton. They even want to try and rig the election at the polling booths, where so many cities are corrupt and voter fraud is all too common.\nThe following comes straight from Pew Research.\nQUOTE: \"Approximately 24 million—one of every eight—voter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate.\"\nQUOTE: \"More than 1.8 million deceased individuals are listed as voters.\"\nQUOTE: \"Approximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state.\"\nThen there is the issue of illegal immigrants voting. The following comes from a 2014 report from the Washington Post. The article was entitled: \"could non-citizens decide the November election?\" Here are some excerpts.\nQUOTE: \"More than 14 percent of non-citizens in both the 2008 and 2010 samples indicated that they were registered to vote.\"\nQUOTE: \"Because non-citizens tended to favor Democrats (Obama won more than 80 percent of the votes of non-citizens in the 2008 sample), we find that this participation was large enough to plausibly account for Democratic victories in a few close elections. Non-citizen votes could have given Senate Democrats the pivotal 60th vote needed to overcome filibusters in order to pass health-care reform and other Obama administration priorities in the 111th Congress. It is also possible that non-citizen votes were responsible for Obama's 2008 victory in North Carolina. Obama won the state by 14,177 votes, so a turnout by 5.1 percent of North Carolina's adult non-citizens would have provided this victory margin.\"\nOur system is also rigged by the donors, giving hundreds of millions to Hillary Clinton's campaign.\nThe reason Hillary Clinton pushes for NAFTA, or the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and for completely open borders, is because her international donors control her every move.\nIf we let the Clinton Cartel run this government, history will record that 2017 was the year America lost its independence.\nWe will not let that happen.\nIt is time to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C.\nThat is why I am proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again.\nWhen Bill Clinton came into office, he signed an executive order saying if you work for the White House or a federal agency, you can't lobby the government for 5 years after you leave. But then, President Clinton did what the Clintons always do – he rigged the system on his way out. Clinton lifted the executive order so the Clintons and their cronies like John Podesta could start raking in cash.\nSo, here is what I am announcing tonight. First: I am going to re-institute a 5-year ban on all executive branch officials lobbying the government for 5 years after they leave government service. I am going to ask Congress to pass this ban into law so that it cannot be lifted by executive order.\nSecond: I am going to ask Congress to institute its own 5-year ban on lobbying by former members of Congress and their staffs.\nThird: I am going to expand the definition of lobbyist so we close all the loopholes that former government officials use by labeling themselves consultants and advisors when we all know they are lobbyists.\nFourth: I am going to issue a lifetime ban against senior executive branch officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government.\nAnd Fifth: I am going to ask Congress to pass a campaign finance reform that prevents registered foreign lobbyists from raising money in American elections.\nNot only will we end our government corruption, but we will end the economic stagnation.\nMy plan for the economy can be summed up in three simple words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\nAt the center of my plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals.\n47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps.\nWe have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world, and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.\nIt's the Clintons who gave us NAFTA, and the Clintons who gave us China's entry into the World Trade Organization.\nBriggs & Stratton has cut thousands of Wisconsin manufacturing jobs and moved them to China.\nGE Healthcare recently closed its Milwaukee location and shipped the jobs to Mexico.\nJohnson Controls shuttered its plants in Milwaukee and West Allis and moved the jobs to Mexico and China.\nThe list goes on and on.\nWe are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.\nA Trump Administration is going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to China, and stop the jobs from leaving our country.\nAs part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we are going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent.\nWe will be a rich nation once again.\nBut to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.\nNational Security begins at the border.\nSpeaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally \"open trade and open borders.\"\nBy \"open trade,\" she means foreign countries can cheat us out of millions of jobs and trillions of dollars.\nBy \"open borders,\" she means totally unlimited immigration.\nIn a secret speech to Goldman Sachs, she said citizens who want to control immigration are \"Un-American.\"\nSo Hillary thinks most of the country is either deplorable, irredeemable, un-American, racist, or basement dwellers supporting Bernie Sanders.\nHillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East – meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores.\nSo let me state this as clearly as I can. If I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.\nWe will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration.\nA Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes, we will build a wall.\nWe have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers.\nAs Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released because their home countries wouldn't take them back.\nThe ICE officers described Hillary's proposal as, quote, the most radical immigration proposal in U.S. history.\" Here is a summary of the Hillary plan:\n--Support for Sanctuary Cities\n--Social Security, Medicare and lifetime welfare for illegal immigrants by making them all citizens\n--Obamacare for illegal immigrants\n--No deportation of visa overstays\n--Expanding catch-and-release on the border\n--Expanding President Obama's unconstitutional executive amnesty, including instant work permits for millions of illegal workers\n--Freeing even more criminal aliens by expanding Obama's non-enforcement directives\n--A 550% increase in Syrian refugees\nEither we win this election, or we lose the country.\nUnder a Trump Administration, it's going to be America First.\nHere are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:\nWe are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every low-income child in America; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; support the men and women of law enforcement; repeal and replace Obamacare; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\nYou have 22 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true.\nOn November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.\nI am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation.\nI'm going to fight for every child living in poverty. I'm going to fight for every mom who lost her child to illegal immigration, and drugs and gang violence.\nI'm going to fight for every community whose jobs and dreams have been ripped out and shipped to other countries.\nI'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people – not the donors.\nAnd I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\nYou're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like you've never seen before. You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time.\nOnce again, we are going to have a government of, by and for the people.\nWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.", "timestamp": "2016-10-17", "title": "Remarks at the KI Convention Center in Green Bay, Wisconsin"}
{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119567", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n**Please see below for a correction, marked with an asterisk.\n1:10 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Happy Monday. I do not have anything off the top, so we can go straight to whatever question may be on your mind.\nDarlene, do you want to start?\nQ: Thank you. The military operation in Mosul, is that something the President expects will be over and done with before he leaves office, or does he expect that will continue into the next administration?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Darlene, I'm not aware that any sort of specific time frame has been laid out for when that operation would be completed. Obviously this represents the next important step in our campaigns -- or our campaign against ISIL in Iraq. The United States has mobilized a 67-member coalition to support the Iraqi government and Iraqi security forces as they seek to rid ISIL from their country.\nMosul is the city that -- it's the second largest city in Iraq. It was the city where ISIL's leader announced their unfulfilled intent to form a caliphate, and it is now the last major center of ISIL in Iraq. The beginning of this campaign has been months in the making, and there have been a number of important steps that Iraqi security forces have taken, with the strong support of the United States and our coalition partners to prepare for this assault against Mosul. But this is obviously an important part of this broader effort to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\nIt's an indication that that effort is moving forward, but there's still a lot of important work to be done before that goal will be realized even inside of Iraq.\nQ: Does the President also see the operation as a test of his theory that you can defeat ISIL on the ground without putting U.S. troops on the ground?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I would describe it as the next test, because the truth is there is important progress that's already been made on the ground in Iraq, that there have been cities like Ramadi and Tikrit that were retaken from ISIL. These were significant cities -- significant in their population size -- that Iraqi security forces did succeed in dislodging ISIL from. They did that with the support of the United States and our coalition partners. So this would be the next test of the strategy.\nAnd I think the President will be the first to acknowledge that this is a significant test. Given the population size of Mosul, given the large geographic area that it encompasses, and the symbolic importance that ISIL has invested in their control of Mosul, dislodging them from the city would be a significant strategic gain. That's why the United States and our Iraqi partners have been working so closely over the last several months to prepare for this operation.\nQ: And another topic. Does the White House have any sort of message for the individuals over the weekend who vandalized the local Republican office in North Carolina?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I haven't spoken to the President about this, but obviously, having seen the reports, there is no justification for the use of violence to advance a political agenda. And as vigorous as the differences that have been on display in the context of this presidential campaign, the significance of those differences can never be used to justify violence.\nAnd the President had the opportunity to speak at the 50th anniversary of the events in Selma in the spring of 2015, about a year and a half ago, and the President acknowledged, even championed and praised political activists who sought to overcome significant differences through the use of nonviolent tactics. And their success is something that benefits all Americans. Their success has also been lasting and consistent with the kinds of values that we have long prided in this country. So that's the model that we should all aspire to, even in a season of rather heated political rhetoric.\nLet me also say that I also saw the reports of Democrats who are using -- at least self-described Democrats -- who are using online tools to raise money among themselves to rebuild that Republican campaign office. That's consistent with the values that we lift up in this country. That's consistent with the kind of political debate that we should be having, which is that neither side benefits from vandalism and violence; both sides benefit from a vigorous debate on the issues, and that as long as we're guided by those values and guided by those kinds of generous sentiments that we've seen from some self-described Democrats, then our country isn't just going to endure this heated election season, we're actually poised to benefit from it.\nAnd we're poised to move forward in a direction that is consistent with our values. And that self-organized online campaign I think is consistent with the President's optimistic vision about the country and about the sense that, for all of our differences, focusing on our shared values, we can make a lot of progress. And our commitment to those shared values is what makes the United States of America the greatest country in the world.\nQ: Lastly, the President was talking about education today and he did that at a high school here in D.C., and it reminded me that in past years, he's given a back-to-school address and he's even spoken at some high school graduation ceremonies. Why did this go away?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, he did that a number of times earlier in his presidency. The President gave several commencement addresses this year, and we squeezed as many on to the schedule as we could.\nAyesha.\nQ: Thank you. I wanted to ask about the visit tomorrow from Italian Prime Minister Renzi. I wanted to know -- see if you could just talk a little bit about what's going to be on the agenda between him and President Obama. What are some of the key things that they're going to be discussing?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, President Obama is looking forward to welcoming Prime Minister Renzi and his wife to the White House for *a state [an official] visit tomorrow. I know the President and First Lady are also really looking forward to the state dinner that they'll be hosting in their honor tomorrow evening.\nDuring the day, there will be an opportunity for President Obama and Prime Minister Renzi to sit down to discuss a range of shared challenges that the United States and Italy confront together. Some of those challenges include the international response to fight carbon pollution and climate change. Italy has been an important partner and made a constructive contribution to the global effort that we've seen to confront that threat.\nItaly is a key member of our counter-ISIL coalition that I was discussing earlier with Darlene. The Italians, for example, have made an important contribution in terms of training local law enforcement in Iraq to allow those cities and communities that have been retaken from ISIL to establish a sense of order and to establish the kind of civic basics in a community that would allow citizens to return home.\nItaly has obviously played an important role in trying to help their European partners confront the migration crisis. We know that Italy has played an important role in the situation in Syria -- they're a founding member of the International Syria Support Group. Italy also has an important relationship with Libya that is important to international efforts to try to navigate the difficult situation in that country with regard to establishing and setting up a viable government there.\nSo many of the issues that we spent a lot of time talking about in here when it comes to the international community are issues in which the United States benefits significantly from Italy's support and friendship. And holding a ceremonial event tomorrow like a state visit and a state dinner to memorialize that partnership and that friendship and that alliance is something the President felt was important before leaving office.\nQ: I also wanted to ask on another topic -- Indian Prime Minister Modi called Pakistan a mothership of terrorism, as tensions between India and Pakistan are heightened. I wonder, does the White House have any response to that sort of rhetoric regarding Pakistan?\nMR. EARNEST: I have to admit I had not been briefed on those comments. What I can say, in general, is that we have encouraged India and Pakistan to look for ways to resolve peacefully their deeply held differences on a range of issues. We have discussed in here on a number of occasions the significant threat that exists in Pakistan from extremists. We've actually seen that the Pakistani people have been victims of those extremist activities on far too many occasions. And the United States and Pakistan have an important relationship when it comes to our shared security concerns in the region, particularly when those concerns emanate from extremist groups.\nBut the United States and India also have a very important relationship, as well. And the friendship and effective working relationship between the United States and India, and between Prime Minister Modi and President Obama have allowed both of our countries to enjoy significant benefits, not just when it comes to our shared security concerns, but also when it comes to our intertwined economies, as well.\nJustin.\nQ: I wanted to ask a couple on Mosul, first. The first is if you could talk about the timing here. Obviously, the President and you guys have been talking for a long time about trying to get the offensive going for the end of the year. But I'm wondering what the reason was to push forward now, and if you're confident that you've done everything you can to prepare.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, significant groundwork has been laid. And as you point out, this has been -- this is an operation that's been months in the works in terms of laying the groundwork to prepare for a successful operation. Our expectation is that this operation will take some time, in part because Mosul is such a large city, but also in part because ISIL has spent the last two years digging in to defend that city. And we would anticipate that they will not hesitate to put innocent civilians in harm's way in an effort to protect that city and they'll use -- a range of what we anticipate will be some deeply unethical and dangerous tactics to try to hold on to that city.\nSo we anticipate facing some significant resistance. But what we also know is that this is an effort that was organized by the Iraqi central government, that the security forces that are moving against Mosul are operating under the command and control of the Iraqi central government. They will benefit significantly from the support of the United States and our coalition partners in terms of carrying out airstrikes. They've already benefitted from training. And many of the forces who have benefitted from the training by the United States and our coalition partners are taking part in this operation. So there's a direct tie between our investment in the professionalism of the Iraqi security forces and the likelihood of success that they'll have against ISIL in Mosul.\nSo this is an important operation, but one that we anticipate is going to take some time, given how significant the city is both strategically and symbolically, how large the city is, and how long ISIL had had to dig in and fortify their defenses in that city.\nQ: Since you kind of raised the humanitarian concerns, I'm wondering both -- the U.N. has been warning that as many as 200,000 people could be displaced in the first days of this offensive. So to go back to my earlier question, have humanitarian groups in particular had enough time to sort of establish refugee camps? And sort of simultaneously, the Iraqi government has been encouraging people to stay in their homes rather than flee. And you raised I think the specter that's concerning everyone of suicide bombings and sort of guerilla warfare in the streets of Mosul. So can you talk about why -- or if the U.S. believes that that advice from the Iraqis was the right advice to give in that situation?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously we've been coordinating very closely with the Iraqis as they've tried to organize this campaign, and do so with the strategic goal in mind of dislodging ISIL from the second largest city in Iraq, but also as they carry out this operation and try to save as many lives as possible.\nI think the first thing for us to acknowledge, Justin, is that while ISIL has been in charge of Mosul they have engaged in a violent campaign to bring that city under their control. They're killing civilians all the time. So the idea that somehow the Iraqi security forces should delay this operation because of their concern about the humanitarian situation in Mosul, that doesn't make sense.\nSo what we have tried to do is to work closely with the international community and the United Nations to plan in advance for the potential that some significant or widespread humanitarian concerns could be prompted by this assault on Mosul. And I know that the U.N. put out a release earlier today, or maybe it was over the weekend, sort of detailing some of the resources that they mobilized in terms of tents and facilities where people who are fleeing violence could be housed temporarily until the operation has been completed. Our expectation is that significant quantities of the food and water and medical supplies that have been mobilized and pre-staged may have to be used to treat those who are fleeing violence.\nSo there's a lot of planning that's been undertaken to try to address the potential humanitarian situation that could be created. But, look, the United States has contributed more than a billion dollars since 2014 to address the humanitarian situation inside of Iraq. We've helped secure pledges around the world for more than $2 billion in humanitarian assistance and stabilization in the run-up to the Mosul operation. So there's a lot of investment that has already gone into this effort in advance of the operation. And I think that will pay dividends as we continue to make progress against ISIL in Mosul.\nHopefully we won't have to spend all those investments. Hopefully the kind of humanitarian situation that we're preparing for won't come to pass. But if it does, there are already significant resources that have been mobilized to try to minimize the impact on innocent civilians there.\nQ: You talked about how the strategy was similar to liberating other Iraqi cities from ISIL. But humanitarian groups, including Human Rights Watch, have noted that in some of those efforts, the U.S. coalition fought alongside Shia militiamen who, by all accounts, committed what could be considered war crimes as they were going through and savagely beating people, desecrating bodies, that sort of thing. So I'm wondering if the U.S. is doing anything to make sure that doesn't happen in this push into Mosul, or to prevent those groups from getting access to U.S. arms.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this is something that the United States has been mindful of from the beginning, and ensuring that this operation is conducted consistent with the need to look out for basic universal human rights and to ensure that these operations are not being used as a cover to carry out retribution against other religious groups is something we've been very focused on in the context of these other operations, not just in Mosul.\nBut with regard to Mosul, in making the announcement about the planned operation, Prime Minister Abadi was clear that only Iraqi security forces would be entering Mosul and undertaking this operation to clear ISIL from the Mosul city limits. And we have seen the Iraqi central government, military leaders of the Iraqi security forces demonstrate and articulate a clear commitment to those principles, and we expect that they will be upheld in the context of this operation as well.\nQ: Last one, on a different subject. WikiLeaks tweeted yesterday that Julian Assange's Internet link had been intentionally severed by a \"state party.\" And so I'm wondering if we could chalk this up to a proportional response that may or may not be announced by the U.S. in retaliation for the Russian leak that you guys named a week or two ago.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I know that there's been -- I've seen some of the reports of this, and I know that there have been a lot of rumors swirling about the potential this may have been linked to some classified U.S. operation. And I'm not in a position to confirm whether that's true or not, just because I'm not in a position to confirm or deny any sort of classified operation on the part of the United States of America.\nAndrew.\nQ: Follow-up on Mosul. Justin touched on some of the concerns about humanitarian preparations, but there's also a political part of this. In many ways, Mosul is a microcosm of some of the problems in Iraq writ large regarding sectarianism. And you're essentially -- there's great concern about what happens the day after Mosul is liberated. I was wondering if you could speak a little bit about the preparation from the political side.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Andrew, there has been an intense focus on making sure that once ISIL has been cleared from communities in Iraq, that there is a strategy for stabilizing those areas that have been cleared of ISIL.\nIn some other communities -- in places like Tikrit and Ramadi -- we know that ISIL was intent on sabotaging the infrastructure of these communities as they left them. And it's an indication of just how depraved ISIL's tactics are, but it's also an indication of the work that we are likely to have in front of us with regard to a situation like Mosul.\nBut, look, similar complexities were presented in Tikrit, and more than 95 percent of the population of Tikrit has returned to their homes in that community. And in Ramadi, about 200,000 people have returned over the course of this year, and that was only -- that's something we were able to do -- those people were only able to return home after a significant quantity of IEDs were cleared from the streets.\nThose of you who traveled with the President to Saudi Arabia earlier this year will recall that the President's meeting with the other leaders of the GCC included a prominent discussion of the kind of financial commitment we would like to see from GCC countries to stabilizing those areas of Iraq where ISIL has been cleared.\nSo the United States has played an important leading role in mobilizing the resources that are needed to stabilize these communities, and we've had some success in rebuilding communities like Ramadi and Tikrit after ISIL has been cleared from them. But that's not to minimize the significant challenge that we'll face in Mosul. Mosul is a large city. Mosul has a larger population than either Ramadi or Tikrit. So we know that the challenge will be significant, but we've done this -- I should say the Iraqis have done this on a smaller scale with the strong support of the international community.\nI think the rest of the international community recognizes that this needs to be a priority, that we can't just be focused on the military effort to clear ISIL, we also need to be thinking ahead strategically about how to stabilize this large city once ISIL has been cleared. And there are resources that have already been mobilized to ensure that that's something that we can do successfully.\nQ: How do you respond to accusations that while the military proportion of this is well advanced, humanitarian and political are not quite so advanced, and the military bit is being rushed because of timing that has to do with the U.S. political calendar and because Abadi needs a victory at home as well?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, with regard to the decision about when to initiate this operation that was a decision that was made by Prime Minister Abadi. We've been clear from the beginning that the Iraqi central government is the one that's calling the shots. And they should. It's their country. They're a sovereign nation. And the support that they're receiving from the United States and our coalition partners is at their request.\nAnd obviously the United States has a very strong relationship with the Iraqi central government. We're able to closely coordinate with them, particularly through our military-to-military channels. And the Iraqi security forces have benefitted significantly from the advice they've received from the United States, particularly our military leadership.\nBut the United States is confident that the decisions that Prime Minister Abadi is making are decisions that he's making for the right reasons. He's not going to be distracted by the American political calendar. He's going to be focused on the strategic considerations that are most likely to contribute to success on the ground in Iraq. He's looking out for the best interests of the Iraqi people. And he's interested in moving expeditiously as quickly as possible to clear ISIL from Mosul, to stabilize that city, and to kick ISIL out of Iraq.\nThat's been a priority that he's been pursuing for quite some time. And we've made steady progress over the last year, year and a half, and this is the next step in that process. And, again, I don't want to leave with you the impression that I'm trying to downplay the significance of this. This is going to be a difficult operation, and this is not something that will yield success overnight. But months of planning has gone into ensuring the success of the military operation, but also in terms of thinking through the humanitarian and political challenges that are almost surely to follow, even after ISIL has been dislodged from the second-largest city in Iraq.\nQ: I understand why you would want to paint this as Abadi's decision alone, but you're not suggesting that he did this without having an explicit commitment from the U.S. on intelligence assets and air support and so forth?\nMR. EARNEST: No. And that was the reason I made that reference to the close coordination between the Abadi government, the U.S. government, and the senior members of the Iraqi security forces and the United States military. There's close coordination here. But, ultimately, the decision to move forward with this operation is one that was made and should be made by the Prime Minister of Iraq.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I just want to follow just a bit about coordination. There were some reports about the U.S.'s 101st Airborne being on the ground, taking part in some of the operations in Mosul. While you can't speak specifically to who or what units may be where, are you prepared to tell the American people that it is likely that Americans will die as a part of this operation in Mosul?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, for which U.S. military personnel or which military units of the United States military are involved, I'd refer you to the Department of Defense and they will be able to give you some more detail about that.\nThe role for U.S. military servicemembers who are supporting Iraqi security forces in this mission is the same role that they have played in other missions around Iraq, which is that Iraqi security forces will be in the lead. This is their fight. They are the ones who must fight for their country and reclaim the ground in their country that ISIL has overtaken. And we've seen Iraqi security forces benefit from the significant training they've received from the United States and other coalition partners, including Italy, in clearing ISIL from other large cities or other large -- other cities in Iraq. So there is a template for pursuing these kinds of operations and completing them successfully.\nThat all said, our men and women in uniform who are serving this country in Iraq are putting themselves in harm's way for our safety and security. We owe them a deep debt of gratitude. And there is no one, including the Commander-in-Chief, who would downplay the risk that they're taking on our behalf. But there also should be no misunderstanding the role that they are playing there. They are not responsible for leading these operations. They are equipped for combat, they are equipped to defend themselves, but their role is to provide advice and assistance to Iraqi security forces that are trying to achieve a military objective.\nQ: Does that include holding Mosul after the primary battle is over?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, the role will continue to be the same. The responsibility for holding that community after ISIL has been dislodged from it will fall to the Iraqi central government and to Iraqi security forces. I know one of the things they're going to be very interested in doing is trying to rebuild the local police force. That was critical to the success in rebuilding communities like Tikrit and Ramadi, and I anticipate that they'll be interested in doing the same thing again in Mosul.\nSo that will be the responsibility of the Iraqi central government, and that's the only way we can ensure their success. If the United States is in a position where we are chiefly responsible for their security, we have seen that that's a strategy that does not yield the kind of long-term benefits that we would like to see. If we're trying to stabilize Iraq over the long term, we need to give the Iraqi central government and the Iraqi forces the confidence and support that they need to provide for their own security information so that the United States is not constantly put in the position of providing it for them.\nQ: Let me ask you about reports, or at least complaints of possible election rigging and voter fraud. You've heard some of the folks in the Trump campaign raise the issue prominently most recently. How concerned is the White House about the possibility of election rigging? I've read reports in Colorado -- and you've seen these before, I'm sure -- dead people voting, and ballot box stuffing, and people voting for family members, and people who are not eligible to vote somehow casting ballots for years. How concerned are you about this?\nMR. EARNEST: Not at all. Neither is Mike Pence, who is the second-highest ranking official of the Trump campaign. Neither is Paul Ryan, if you believe his spokesperson, who indicated that he had confidence that this election would be conducted fairly.\nWhen you take a look at the battleground states, the states where this election -- the presidential election, at least -- is likely to be decided, we're talking about states like Georgia and Arizona and Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, Indiana, Iowa.\nQ: Colorado.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, at least the states that I've named, all of which are going to play an important role in this election, all have Republican governors. And presumably all those governors have confidence in the ability of their states to manage these elections fairly. We have seen these kinds of suggestions in the past, but any time there's been an effort to actually conduct a study and investigate suggestions of widespread voter fraud, there's never been evidence to substantiate it.\nSo the President is very confident in the ability and honesty of election officials in both parties in states all across the country to ensure that this upcoming national election is conducted freely and fairly.\nBill.\nQ: Now that the Vice President has signaled that there will be a retaliation for the Russian cyberattacks, can you tell us whether it's likely to be a cyberattack in return or some sort of diplomatic retaliation?\nMR. EARNEST: Bill, we have indicated that we're not going to take -- at least when I'm talking, I'm not going to be in a position of taking an option off the table for the Commander-in-Chief as he considers an appropriate, proportional response to efforts by the Russians to undermine, or at least tamper with, our political system. Whatever response the President does settle on is one that we are unlikely to announce in advance. It's also something that we're -- in some cases, we may never acknowledge. But what we are prepared to do is to make clear that this is an important issue for us and one that the President and his team will consider very carefully.\nWith regard to the Vice President's comments, obviously he was saying something that's not all that different than what you've heard me say on a number of occasions, and even heard the President say on a number of occasions, which is that the United States maintains significant capabilities in cyberspace, and those capabilities far exceed the kinds of capabilities that are maintained by other countries.\nQ: You said there will be a response. Has there been one already?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, as the President considers an appropriate response, it's not likely to be something that we'll announce in advance. And with regard to -- and it may be something that we don't ever acknowledge. The one thing I will make clear is the range of responses that are available to the President aren't just limited to the cyber sphere. There are other responses, including the use of financial sanctions. The President, earlier this year, signed an executive order designating authority to the Secretary of the Treasury allowing the United States government to deploy economic sanctions against individuals or even countries that are involved in nefarious activities in cyberspace. So the President has taken steps to give his own administration more authorities to be considered as part of an effective and proportional response.\nQ: Did the White House sign off on the Justice Department decision to prosecute General Cartwright? And if so, why?\nMR. EARNEST: Those kinds of prosecutorial decisions are made exclusively and solely by federal career prosecutors at the Department of Justice, and all of that was done without any White House input.\nRon.\nQ: On the hacking issue -- what do you make of these reports about these emails suggesting there was some sort of quid pro quo between the State Department and the FBI offered during the Clinton years there?\nMR. EARNEST: Not much, because both the State Department and the FBI have denied that any such arrangement existed.\nQ: But the documents seem to speak very clearly, plainly, that that's what was happening. You would expect that the State Department and FBI would say that didn't happen.\nMR. EARNEST: Are you suggesting that they would lie? Look, man, if that's the place that we're going to be in, then I think maybe you should go ask somebody else. The point is, both the State Department and the FBI indicated that the purported arrangement that is being flaunted around by congressional Republicans is not true.\nAnd here's the other thing: The FBI did take a look into it. There were investigators who were taking a look at the situation, and they didn't choose to prosecute anybody. So again, I recognize that Congressman Chaffetz likes to try to make a big deal of these kinds of things. But the fact of the matter is this is a member of Congress who is leading a Benghazi commission that Republicans in Congress acknowledged was geared solely to trying to drive down Hillary Clinton's poll numbers. And when you consider who might be a bad messenger when it comes to prosecuting these criticisms, I might have in mind a Congressman who passes around an official business card with a Gmail email address on it. And that's exactly what Congressman Chaffetz has done. So it doesn't put him in a very good position to be criticizing the email habits of other people when he's engaged in the worst kind of that behavior.\nQ: So you're saying that the purported document is false somehow, was doctored? Is not --\nMR. EARNEST: Ron, what I'm suggesting is that if there's a suggestion that somehow the FBI and the State Department were involved in a quid pro quo, that the thing you would do is go and ask the State Department and the FBI if they were involved in a quid pro quo. That's what other journalists have done, and those journalists have found that both the State Department and the FBI said on the record that that was an inaccurate allegation.\nQ: In terms of ISIS, does ISIS still have the ability to coordinate, not just inspire, attacks, despite the Mosul operation and despite where you think you are on the effort now?\nMR. EARNEST: The United States remains vigilant about the threat that is posed by ISIL. We have significantly degraded their ability to organize those kinds of attacks, but we remain vigilant to guard against them. And that's why we continue to look for ways to apply pressure to senior ISIL leaders to prevent them from being able to orchestrate and organize those attacks that may threaten the United States or our allies around the world.\nQ: And after Mosul is captured, presumably they will still have this ability?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we know that there is a significant chunk of ISIL's leadership that remains in Raqqa, but being able to dislodge from Mosul will have a positive impact, from our standpoint, in terms of degrading their ability to plan and organize and orchestrate attacks overseas. But it doesn't eliminate it. And it's important for the United States and the rest of the international community to remain vigilant about that threat.\nQ: And what's the administration's thinking now about Raqqa and about a kind of offensive there?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we continue to support opposition forces on the ground that are engaged in shaping the battlefield to prepare for the commencement of that operation, but that's not something that's started yet.\nQ: And there's been no significant change in the level of support or what the United States is doing to help its forces or allies, if you will, in Syria?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there's been important work that's been done there in terms of helping those opposition forces reclaim a significant swath of territory in Northern Syria from ISIL fighters. And it has put us in an important strategic position of cutting off ISIL's access to the border with Turkey. But the operation against Raqqa has not commenced at this point.\nQ: What about the -- the talks over the weekend produced nothing. So what's the next step? Is there anything at all?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I don't think that's how Secretary Kerry would describe what's happened there, but you can check with him to get a better sense of --\nQ: Well, what did happen then? There was a meeting in Switzerland, Lausanne. What happened? What positive --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Secretary Kerry continues to be engaged with our partners both in the region and around the world to try to exert diplomatic pressure in Syria to try to reduce the violence there, to try to get the Assad regime and the Russians to stop engaging in these kinds of tactics that actually target civilians, and allow for humanitarian assistance to flow to those areas of Syria that need it so badly.\nQ: But is there anything that came out of that that's going to improve the situation in, say, Aleppo now?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there will be continued diplomatic engagement on a variety of levels on this. I don't anticipate any announcements of a major breakthrough. I think that was clear before the meeting; it's also clear after the meeting. But what is happening behind the scenes is a continued, sustained, vigorous diplomatic effort to engage the wide variety of countries that are deeply concerned about the situation in Syria to try to come up with a solution there that will reduce the violence, that will increase the flow of humanitarian assistance, and it will kick-start the kind of political talks that are badly needed to address the root cause of the problems in Syria.\nLana.\nQ: I want to get tenses straight in regards to Russia and the potential for a U.S. counter-cyber. You said whatever response the President does settle on. Does this mean that he is still considering different options at the moment?\nMR. EARNEST: It means the President and his team are continuing to evaluate exactly what Russia has done. And, yes, they are still considering the potential response. But, again, I'm not really in a position to help you with the verb tenses, though, in terms of whether or not any sort of -- any semblance of a response has already been initiated.\nQ: The Vice President's cryptic message to Russia and their President in regards to these hacking attacks, was that something coordinated and encouraged by the White House?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the Vice President was obviously answering a question from an interviewer, but the Vice President has Obviously been deeply engaged in the conversations that the President has been having with the rest of his national security team about formulating the kind of appropriate response the President believes is in the best interest of the American people.\nQ: Well, did that mean to send a message to Vladimir Putin?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think the Vice President was answering a question. And he is obviously somebody who has a lot of influence on the policymaking process here at the White House and he is somebody who obviously has decades of experience in terms of helping to shape and manage the U.S.-Russia relationship. He is also somebody who has spent a lot of time thinking about cyber policy and he understands the significance of these kinds of decisions, given that in many ways the cyber realm is one where rules of the road have not been established, and establishing precedents -- specific precedents and norms has long-term consequences. So he certainly understands the need for caution and prudence when considering potential responses. But he also is somebody who has his own deeply engrained sense of what's necessary to protect the American people and protect the United States of America.\nQ: He is having a state visit tomorrow. There are some reports that Italy may be the next nation to leave the EU. Is that something that potentially would be -- is that something that is on the President's agenda? Will he try and dissuade the Prime Minister from a BREXIT type response?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware that that's something that rates very highly on the agenda. When you consider all of the other high priorities that the two leaders need to discuss, that kind of speculation I'm not sure would come up.\nQ: So a discussion about the EU is a low priority in tomorrow's visit?\nMR. EARNEST: No, no. I think that obviously Italy is an important partner of the United States, an important ally of the United States, particularly when it comes to our relationship with Europe and all of the efforts that we undertake to strengthen our collective security and to strengthen the economic ties that bind the United States with Europe.\nI think the prospect of Italy leaving the EU is not one that is likely to come up, frankly, because I think -- I haven't actually seen that much coverage of that coming to pass. Italy makes an important contribution to stability in Europe. They make an important contribution to the European economy. They obviously make important contributions to Europe's security through NATO. So those I think are likely to be the topics of conversation between the President and Prime Minister.\nQ: And on Saturday, Donald Trump suggested that presidential candidates should have to take a drug test. White House response?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, so you're telling me that the candidate who snorted his way through the first two debates is accusing the other candidate of taking drugs? That's a curious development in the campaign.\nQ: That's your response?\nMR. EARNEST: That's my response.\nMichelle.\nQ: Are you saying just now that you think that the sniffling or snorting, as you described it, might have been related to --\nMR. EARNEST: Not at all.\nQ: Okay, so what were you saying? What were you trying to get across when you said that?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm trying to have a little fun. (Laughter.) You guys are so serious today.\nQ: Well, you heard the gasps in the crowd. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah, I was expecting more chuckles. (Laughter.) It's probably my flawed delivery. (Laughter.)\nQ: It's Monday. Not a Friday.\nQ: I laughed.\nMR. EARNEST: Thank you, Mark.\nQ: Okay, so you were saying that the President is still continuing to evaluate what has happened with the cyberattack and to look at what the response could be. But you also said something about you're not in a position to say whether it might have been initiated. So can you just clarify that? Is it possible, then, that whatever the U.S. response is going to be may have already started?\nMR. EARNEST: I think what I will -- the best way that I can clarify this situation is just to make clear that our response is not something that we're going to be in a position to discuss publicly. So I can't give you a time frame about whether or not something has started or whether or not it's ended. What I can tell you is that the United States is still evaluating exactly what has happened. There's still an active investigation that is ongoing. The President and his national security team are still learning from that investigation, and they're still considering what sort of response is appropriate.\nOnce the President has made a decision about that, that's not likely to be something that we'll announce in advance. With some aspects of the response, it may be something that we never acknowledge. But the range of responses that are open to the President extend beyond just the cyber realm. They include sanctions and other diplomatic efforts that could make clear our concern with Russia's nefarious behavior in cyberspace.\nQ: All right, well, it just sounded initially like you were saying you weren't ruling out that the response may have already started. But now, as you clarify, you say that it's still being evaluated, so it sounds like now you are ruling out that it might have started.\nMR. EARNEST: No. Again, I think the point of both my attempts to answer Lana's question and yours is hamstrung by the fact that I'm not going to be in a position to discuss the response.\nQ: But when you say things like, but the President is still considering what the best options would be, that sounds like there's been no response yet. So is that accurate?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I'm just not going to be in a position to confirm our response. So that's not accurate. I'm not in a position to confirm whether or not that is accurate.\nQ: Okay. All right, that's fine. And when we were talking earlier about the humanitarian consequences that could happen after Mosul. And you said that there has been coordination ahead of time, there's been well-thought-out sort of preparation. But you do hear from certain groups, especially over the weekend, saying that when you look at the emergency camps that have been established outside Mosul there's only room for 60,000 or so, but there could be 200,000 just in the initial days and we could see more than a million Iraqis affected by this operation. So are you saying that those -- when you say that the response that's been prepared to humanitarian concerns is well-though- out and planned, are you saying that those estimates that we're seeing and the concerns we're seeing might be inflated? That you think that that won't be a problem to that extent?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think that our approach to each of these situations is to prepare for the worst. And that is why you have seen so much work going into preparing for a range of humanitarian contingencies. That's why you've seen the United Nations take the lead in trying to collect significant resources from around the world to prepare for those humanitarian contingencies.\nBut no one can predict precisely what will transpire. We just want to ensure -- and when I say \"we,\" I mean the international community wants to ensure that we've thought through what those possible contingencies could be. And that's why you've seen the United Nations work to mobilize temporary housing for a large number of people. There's been water and food and medical supplies that have been pre-staged, or staged strategically so that they can be quickly used to offer relief to individuals who are fleeing violence. And I know the United Nations has actually indicated that they're interested in in collecting additional resources because they believe there is more preparation that can be done to prepare for the wide range of contingencies.\nSo we're mindful of this potential need to care for the basic humanitarian needs of a large number of people fleeing violence from Mosul. But what's also true is the people who are in Mosul right now and have been stuck in Mosul for the last two years are facing a rather dire humanitarian situation.\nWe know that ISIL, in an attempt to try to exercise control over that city, has killed innocent people, has tortured people, has used violence as a tool to try to pacify the population. So that's why there's a sense of urgency about mobilizing an effective response militarily to drive ISIL from the city, but also to make sure that there are resources mobilized to deal with any humanitarian contingencies that may arise.\nQ: Over the past couple of days we've seen the number of women accusing Donald Trump of either assaulting them or acting inappropriate with them growing. How does the President respond to that? What is the administration's response to seeing some of these stories coming out kind of fast and furious?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think for some insight into the administration's response, I'd refer you to the powerful speech that was delivered by the First Lady at the end of last week. I think she spoke powerfully about this situation, about the way that millions of American women in both parties are responding to it. As she described it, it's something that goes to our core values as Americans. It goes to our basic sense of fairness and justice and freedom.\nSo she has obviously thought about and responded very powerfully with her own personal reaction to this situation and to the tone and tenor of the debate and even the nature of the debate over the last couple of weeks. And she can speak to that more eloquently and more powerfully than I've been able to.\nJean.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. On North Korea. North Korea launched Musudan ballistic missile last weekend. Do you have any comment on that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I can confirm that the U.S. Strategic Command detected what we assess was a failed North Korean missile launch over the weekend near the northwestern city of Kusong. The missile is presumed to be a Musudan intermediate range ballistic missile, and NORAD determined that the missile launch from North Korea did not pose a threat to North America.\nAs we've said on a number of occasions, each time that North Korea conducts a test like this we strongly condemn this missile test because it violates the U.N. Security Council resolutions that explicitly prohibit North Korea's launches like this one.\nThe United States has worked with our partners and allies in the region to isolate North Korea and to apply pressure to them to try to persuade them not to engage in this kind of destabilizing behavior. And the United States is prepared and has mobilized the appropriate military resources to defend our allies and ourselves. And that is why the United States has been in discussions with our South Korean allies about deploying a THAAD battery, an anti-ballistic missile battery, to South Korea to protect South Korea from the ballistic missile threat emanating from North Korea.\nThere's other equipment and resources that have been mobilized in the Asia Pacific region, including to Japan, Alaska, and Guam, to counter this threat and to protect the American people and our allies. All of that is a reflection of the threat that emanates from North Korea, and all of that reflects the President's determination to ensure that the safety and security of the American people is protected.\nQ: So will the U.S. take another additional sanctions on these?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have a specific response to outline for you, but obviously the United States will continue to stay in close touch with our allies and partners in the region to ensure that we continue to apply pressure to the North Korean regime and protect our interests in that part of the world.\nQ: Yesterday, the North Korean high-level government officer announced that North Korea is preparing for the missile launch or a nuclear test that would be at the end of this year. So how would the U.S. plan on this?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, we've been deeply concerned about the willingness of the North Korean regime to ignore or even flout their basic international obligations. And that hasn't just been a source of concern for the United States; it's also been a source of concern by our allies in South Korea and Japan. Both China and Russia have expressed concerns about this kind of destabilizing behavior from the North Koreans. And it's an indication of just how isolated the North Koreans are right now.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, if the U.S. doesn't acknowledge that it responded to Russian cyber nefarious action, how will Russia know it's been retaliated against? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think this is -- the concerns that we have are concerns that we've made clear, both publicly and privately. The President has alluded to previous conversations he's had with President Putin about our concerns about their malign activities in cyberspace. So Russia is certainly aware of our concerns about their behavior.\nQ: So when there is response, you're saying Russia will get it? They'll understand where it's coming from and that they're being retaliated against for their actions?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I'll let the Russians speak for themselves with regard to whatever it is that they conclude or understand about a particular situation. What I've tried to do is speak as clearly as possible about our concerns about what the IC* has concluded about Russia's activities in cyberspace, and I've tried to be as clear as possible within the significant constraints that I have here to make clear that the President believes it's important for the United States to use our resources to protect our election's infrastructure and to consider an appropriate, proportional response.\nQ: And one clarification. You said the Renzi visit tomorrow was a state visit. I thought it's an official with a state dinner?\nMR. EARNEST: It's not in my material, but we can clarify that for you just to get to the bottom of it.\nGo ahead, JC.\nQ: Will there be --\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know all the plans that are in place for tomorrow, but we'll keep you posted.\nLalit, I saw you had your hand up.\nQ: Thank you. Prime Minister Modi said those remarks about Pakistan is the mothership of terrorism at the BRICS Summit, which was held in Goa this week. And the BRICS Summit, China and Russia are very reluctant to include the name of (inaudible) in the joint statement that they issued. In that context, how do you see the commitment or the partnership of Russia and China in the war against terrorism?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess I would characterize it as simply that Russia has often made a strong case -- or what they believe to be a strong case to the United States about our shared interest in confronting extremists not just in Syria and Iraq but around the world, and there are things that they've done in the past that would indicate that they're not as committed to that shared priority as they claim to be, in part because they devote so much time to shoring up the Assad regime in a way that makes it harder to resolve the conflict that ends up fueling extremism.\nSo we've been -- it's no secret that we've been frustrated about Russia's inability to live up to the commitments that they claim they're willing to make in the context of shared priorities. And the fact that they have not followed through on those commitments raises questions about whether or not they actually share those priorities.\nSo I can't speak to the specific statement that was signed at the BRICS conference, but the United States does believe that there are countries around the world with whom we should be able to coordinate to counter extremism. The forces of extremism only threaten the interests of countries around the world, and there should be an opportunity for the international community to coordinate our response and to counter those threats, but sometimes the Russians haven't been as willing partners as we'd like them to be.\nQ: And China, which had been particularly blocking attempts to sanction against well-known terrorist groups at the U.N. Security Council.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think China is an example of a country with whom we have been able to work very effectively in pursuit of some common interests, but there are some interests where we have not been able to -- where apparently our interests don't align.\nSo, again, I can't speak to the specific decision because, obviously, the United States wasn't a party to the BRICS conference, but the United States does have an aspiration to work more effectively in the international community to counter extremist threats. And there are countries like Italy, with whom the United States is able to work very effectively in a way that safeguards the safety and security of citizens in both our countries. Our relationship with countries like Russia and China is obviously a lot different than it is with a country like Italy.\nGoyal, go ahead.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Two questions. One, so far as the U.S. and India relations are concerned, these are the holidays in India that fighting against evil or evils and all that going on. What my question is, after 15 years of 9/11 and also five years of killing Osama Bin Laden, and millions of people around the globe are thanking President Obama, of course. But Pakistan is denying that Osama bin Laden was in Pakistan. And also at the same time, Madam Hillary Clinton recently meeting Indian-Americans at the Silicon Valley she said that the U.S. and India to fight poverty and hunger. And same thing Prime Minister Modi had told the Pakistan people because they are the victims of the terrorism, because still Pakistan is keeping so many terrorists there and feeding and training them and -- wanted by the U.S. and India.\nMy question is that where do we go from here? Because there is a call in the U.S. Congress and online petition by the Indian American community that Pakistan should be declared a state sponsor of terrorism to stop terrorism around the globe.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Goyal, I can't account for many of the things that you included in your question. What I can say in general is that the United States has been able to work effectively with Pakistan to confront extremist threats that threaten the interests of both our countries.\nAt the same time, we've acknowledged on a number of occasions that there is more that we would like to see Pakistan do to confront that threat, in part because the Pakistani people face a unique threat from those extremists. And there are many times when I've stood at this podium being asked to respond to the attacks from extremists that were carried out inside of Pakistan that resulted in the death or injury of many Pakistani citizens.\nSo there is a built-in interest for Pakistan to confront this extremist threat that they face. And there are a variety of ways in which the United States supports them in those efforts. But of course, there is more that we believe that they can and should do, and we'll continue to have those conversations with them.\nQ: Second, once again on behalf of the Indian-American community and a billion people in India, they are very thankful to President Obama and this administration. First it was (inaudible) who was the first Indian-American congressman in the '50s, and now there is a post office in his name in his hometown in California. And now, because of this administration and President Obama, there is a Diwali stamp, and it has been issued by the U.S. Postal Service. It is available around the U.S., and people are even now sending requests from around the globe for this stamp.\nSo any -- Diwali is coming up in the next two weeks. Any message from the President on this Diwali stamp and to the community?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I don't know that the White House can claim any credit for the decision on the part of the Postal Service to start printing and distributing Diwali stamps. But I would anticipate that the President and First Lady will issue a statement on the occasions of Diwali to offer their greetings to those who are celebrating the holiday.\nObviously, as we've discussed a couple of times here, Goyal, the United States and India share deep cultural ties. So there's a large and active Indian American population here in the United States that contributes greatly to the success and vibrancy of our country, our economy and our democracy. And our country benefits from the large Indian American population that lives here and makes tangible contributions to our country on a daily basis.\nSo if the issuance of that stamp is viewed by the Indian community as an affirmation of the important role that they play in our country, then that certainly would please the President of the United States.\nQ: And finally, (inaudible) to the many, many congressmen and senators on the Capitol Hill who have worked with the administration for this effort. Thank you.\nMR. EARNEST: So great. Thanks, Goyal.\nMark, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: I wanted to ask you about a comment Hillary Clinton made in a speech to Goldman Sachs. This was a series of things that were hacked in the last couple of days. She was talking about covert activity; I think it was in the context of Syria. And she said, \"We used to be much better at this than we are now. Now you know everybody can't help themselves. They go out and tell their friendly reporters and somebody else, look what we're doing, and I want credit for it.\" I'm wondering whether the President shares her concern that covert action is more difficult for the United States to take because there is a tendency of people to talk out of school.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it's an interesting question to ask the President's spokesperson -- (laughter) -- who I think, over the course of many administrations, has historically played the role of complaining about the unauthorized leak of sensitive information. I've, on a number of occasions, had the opportunity to fill that role in this administration as well.\nLet me start by issuing my typical disclaimer, which is that I've been quite reluctant to comment directly on the stolen emails of a private citizen. And so while I know much of the reporting indicates that there's plenty of reason to believe that this particular transcript is an accurate reflection of what she said, I do think I want to initiate my response by noting the stolen nature of the materials.\nWith regard to the President's thought on this question, though, which I think is where you're going, you all have heard the President speak publicly on a number of occasions about how preserving secrecy and confidentiality does advance our national security interests. The President's view, though, is that we should be quite judicious about deciding to invoke that kind of secrecy. In fact, the President has undertaken a number of initiatives to make our national security apparatus and our national security operations more transparent.\nAnd even in The New York Times over the weekend, Mark, there was a careful look at this by your colleagues with regard to our operations in Somalia. Many of the details that were included in that story were reported because they were disclosed by the United States government that there were war powers report notifications made to Capitol Hill about the deployment of U.S. military personnel. There were news releases generated by the Department of Defense announcing certain counterterrorism strikes, including those that were successful against Shabbaab leaders. There have also been public acknowledgements about investigations of strikes that may have results in some civilian casualties.\nThe President believes that that level of transparency gives the United States of America the opportunity to indicate our commitment to upholding the kinds of values that we cherish -- in fact, in some cases, the kinds of values that we're actually fighting for.\nSo the President has long acknowledged the need for some secrecy. But he believes that so much of what we do to keep the country safe on his orders is something that is even more effective when we can be transparent about it. And there are some cases where that's just not possible. And where that's not possible, the President believes it's important for those who have taken an oath to protect national security information to follow through on that commitment.\nBut the President also, I think -- part of his legacy will be the dogged commitment that he has pursued to make these kinds of operations and make many of these efforts more transparent than they have been in previous administrations.\nThanks, everybody. We'll see you later.\nEND 2:17 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2016-10-17", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "The President spoke at 11:21 a.m. In his remarks, he referred to former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and his wife Alma J. Powell, chair, America's Promise Alliance; Anita M. Berger, principal, Benjamin Banneker Academic High School; and Ifunanya Chukwu Azikiwe, student, Benjamin Banneker Academic High School, who introduced the President.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119517", "text": "Hello, Bulldogs! [Applause] Hey! Good to see you guys. How's everybody doing? Oh, you all look good. You look good. Hey! How's everybody?\nWell, it is so nice to see you guys. Everybody, have a seat though. Have a seat. I know you've been waiting here a while. Good thing you all had your phones with you. As the father of two teenage daughters, I know the whole time you were just like, \"And then, he said—girl, I couldn't believe it.\" [Laughter]\nAnyway, it's so good to see you. [Applause] Thank you! A couple of people I want to acknowledge. First of all, I want to thank our Secretary of Education, who has done outstanding work, John King is in the house. And then, my great friend and former Education Secretary and multiple winner of the three-on-three contest, as well as at the NBA All-Star Game—he can ball—Arne Duncan. We've got your mayor, Muriel Bowser is here. Give her a big round of applause. Your Representative, Eleanor Holmes Norton. And we are so grateful not only for their service to the country, but the amazing work they're doing with their philanthropic work and America's Promise, Colin and Alma Powell.\nSo by now you've settled into the new year. Right? Adjusted to classes. You're preparing for Spirit Week. Learning how to ballroom dance. [Laughter] I remember having to do that. Getting the nerve to text that cute girl or boy in your English class. [Laughter] I don't remember that; we did not have texts. We had to send little notes. And then, we used to actually have to go up to somebody if we liked them and talk to them. So you—that may happen to you someday. [Laughter] Seniors are looking at colleges, taking tests, filling out all the forms. And Malia just went through this, so I know how tough this is for you and for the parents.\nBut as I'm winding down my Presidency, I was so impressed with Banneker the last time I was here in 2011 that I wanted to come back, because you're an example of a school that's doing things the right way. And I believe that if you're going to be able to do whatever you want to do in your lives—if you want to become a teacher or a doctor or start a business or develop the next great app or be President—then you've got to have great education.\nWe live in a global economy. And when you graduate, you're no longer going to be competing just with somebody here in DC for a great job. You're competing with somebody on the other side of the world, in China or in India, because jobs can go wherever they want because of the Internet and because of technology. And the best jobs are going to go to the people who are the best educated, whether in India or China or anywhere in the world.\nSo when I took office almost 8 years ago, we knew that our education system was falling short when it came to preparing young people like you for that reality. Our public schools had been the envy of the world, but the world caught up. And we started getting outpaced when it came to math and science education. And African American and Latino students, in part because of the legacy of discrimination, too often lagged behind our White classmates, something called the achievement gap that, by one estimate, costs us hundreds of billions of dollars a year. And we were behind other developed countries when it came to the number of young people who were getting a higher education. So I said, when I first came into office, by 2020, I want us to be number one again. I want us to be number one across the board.\nSo we got to work, making real changes to improve the chances for all of our young people, from the time they're born all the way through until they got a career. And the good news is that we've made real progress. So I just wanted to talk to you about the progress we've made, because you are the reason we've made progress: some outstanding young people all across the country.\nWe recently learned that America's high school graduation rate went up to 83 percent, which is the highest on record. That's good news. More African American and Latino students are graduating than ever before. Right here in DC, in just 5 years, the graduation rate in the District of Columbia public schools went from just 53 percent to 69 percent. So DC's graduation rates grew faster than any other place in the country this year—this past year, which is something to be really proud of.\nNow, of course, here at Banneker, you graduated 100 percent of your seniors last year. One hundred percent. It's been a while since I did math, but 100 percent is good. [Laughter] You can't do better than that. So what all these numbers mean is that more schools across DC and across the country are starting to catch up to what you guys are doing here at this school.\nNow, some of the changes we made were hard, and some of them were controversial. We expected more from our teachers and our students. But the hard work that people have put in across the country has started to pay off.\nAnd I just want to talk to you a little bit about some of the things that we did. It starts with our youngest learners. High-quality early education is one of the best investments we can make, which is why we've added over 60,000 children to Head Start. We called for high-quality preschool for every 4-year-old in America. And when I took office, only 38 States offered access to State-funded preschool. Today, it's up to 46. We're trying to get those last holdouts to do the right thing. And by the way, the District of Columbia leads the Nation with the highest share of children—nearly 9 out of 10—in high-quality preschool. And that's a big achievement.\nWe launched then a competition called Race to the Top, which inspired States to set higher, better standards so that we could outteach and outcompete other Nations and make sure that we've got high expectations for our students. DC was one of the winners of this competition. It upgraded standards, upgraded curriculum, worked to help teachers build their skills. And that, in part, is why DC has done so well.\nWe realized that in today's world, when you all have a computer in your pocket in those phones, then you need to learn not just how to use a phone, you need to learn computer science. So we're working with private and philanthropic partners to bring high schools into the 21st century and give you a more personalized and real-world experience. We're bringing in high-speed Internet into schools and libraries, reaching 20 million more students and helping teachers with digital learning. And coding isn't, by the way, just for boys in Silicon Valley, so we're investing more in getting girls and young women and young people of color and low-income students into science and engineering and technology and math.\nAnd because we know that nothing is more important than a great teacher—and you've got some great teachers here, as well as a great principal at Banneker—we have focused on preparing and developing and supporting and rewarding excellent educators. You all know how hard they work. They stay up late grading your assignments. That's why you've got all those marks all over your papers. [Laughter] They pull sometimes money out of their own pockets to make that lesson extra special. And I promise you, the teachers here and the teachers around the country, they're not doing it for the pay, because teachers, unfortunately, still aren't paid as much as they should be. They're not doing it for the glory. They're doing it because they love you and they believe in you and they want to help you succeed.\nSo teachers deserve more than just our gratitude—they deserve our full support. And we've got to make their lives easier, which is why we enacted a law to fix No Child Left Behind, which gives teachers more flexibility to spend more time teaching creatively than just spending all their time teaching to a test. Give your teachers a big round of applause. They deserve it.\nSo we've made real progress, but here's the thing—and I think all of you know this because you go to this great school—a high school education these days is not enough. By 2020, two out of three job openings require some form of higher education. Now, that doesn't always mean a 4-year college degree, but it does mean—whether it's a 4-year university or a community college or some sort of training program—you've got to get a little bit more than just what you're getting in high school.\nIt used to be that a high school job might be enough because you could go into a factory or even go into an office and just do some repetitive work, and if you were willing to work hard, you could make a decent living. But the problem is, repetitive work now is done by machines. And that's just going to be more and more true. So in order for you to succeed in the marketplace, you've got to be able to think creatively; you've got to be able to work with a team; you've got to be able to work with a machine and figure out how to make it tailored for the specific requirements of your business and your job. All those things require some more sophisticated thinking than just sitting there and just doing the same thing over and over again. And that's why you've got to have more than just a high school education.\nAnd if you doubt that, I just want to give you some statistics. If—compared to a high school diploma, just getting a degree from a 2-year school,—going to a community college and getting an associate's degree—could earn you more than $300,000 over the course of your lifetime. And a 4-year degree earns you a million dollars more than if you just had a high school degree. Think about that. I mean, a million dollars, that's real money.\nSo one of the things that we're trying to do is to make it easier for you to access free money for college, to figure out how you can pay for your college without having a mountain of debt. And the key thing, as you know here at Banneker, but I want all the students around the country to do this—and Michelle and I and others have been really emphasizing this—is to fill out your FAFSA, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid.\nHow many people—how many seniors here have already filled out their FAFSA forms? All right. How many seniors here have not filled out their FAFSA forms? Fess up now. [Laughter] You sure? All right, I just want to make sure now. And, juniors, you can start getting ready now.\nBecause what the FAFSA does is, it puts you in the running for scholarships, grants, loans, work-study jobs, all to help you pay for college. And we've made it simpler than ever. And it's available right now at FAFSA.gov—FAFSA.gov. And since this is one of the most important investments of your life, next year's FAFSA is also going to direct you to something we created called our College Scorecard.\nNow, here's what this is. It gives you comprehensive information on every college in America. Now, some of you who have started applying for colleges, you know about these college rankings, right? It's, like, oh, this is the best school. And some of that information is useful; some of it not so much. But unlike traditional rankings that focus on which school has the fanciest dorm or the nicest football stadiums or is the most expensive or the most exclusive, what our College Scorecard does is, it focuses on some of the things that really matter for your future. Things like how many students actually graduate from the school, because it's not enough just to enroll in college; you've got to graduate from college. How much money do their alumni earn? What percentage of their students can pay back their loans? And what we've done is, we've worked with companies like Google to put this information right at your fingertips.\nSo for a decision this important, we want you to be able to comparison shop to figure out how do you get the best value for your money, just like if you were buying something on Amazon. Right? If you were buying a car or you're buying a phone or you're buying anything, especially if it's a pretty big purchase, you want to know ahead of time, is this legit? And what this does is makes you think about what your options are.\nNow, you've got some great counselors here. Obviously, you should work with them. But not every student may be going to a school like Banneker that has as many good counselors to think about their college education. And using this College Scorecard is going to be helpful for them to do a little comparison shopping. Because you don't want to go to the school just because it's the closest one, and it turns out, it's more expensive and doesn't do as good of a job as if you were willing to maybe travel someplace else, and it turns out that you could get the financial aid you need to go to a school that's more suited toward your needs. Right?\nSo we also reformed, by the way, the student loan system. When I came into office, you had tens of billions of dollars that were going to big banks, serving as middlemen for your student loans. We said, well, let's cut out the banks. Let's give the money directly to the students so they can afford college, and we can make the loans cheaper, and we can expand Pell grants.\nAnd now, what we're trying to do is to push to make 2 years of community college free for every responsible student all across the country. [Applause] All across the country. And we're starting to work with colleges around—and universities around the country to bring down the cost of college so that at the end of 4 years of college you're not saddled with a whole bunch of debt, because nobody should be priced out of a higher education.\nSo bottom line is, higher graduation rates, higher college attendance rates; more money for Pell grants and work to make sure that the interest rate on student loans haven't gone up; working to expand early childhood education and preschool; continuing to watch and work with States as they try to implement reforms to make K through 12 better; holding colleges more accountable for giving information so that students can make good decisions—we've made a lot of progress. We have made a lot of progress in terms of making sure that young people across the country get the kind of great education that you're getting here at Banneker. And I am really proud of what we've accomplished. I'm proud of what the District of Columbia has accomplished.\nBut I just want to be honest with you: We've still got more work to do. So as I go, I'm giving you kind of a final report card, transcript on what more we've got to get done. [Laughter]\nThere are still too many States that are cutting back on public education. And part of the reason tuition is going up is because States aren't putting as much money into State education, universities, community colleges as they used to. That's why, if you're 18, by the way, you've got to vote to make sure that the folks who represent you actually are delivering.\nWe've still got too many States that have not really worked in a serious way to raise standards and improve performance. In too many school districts, we still have schools that, despite the heroic efforts of a lot of great teachers, are not fully preparing our kids for success because they just don't have the resources to do it or the structure to do it. We've still got too many high schools where a third of their students do not earn their diplomas on time.\nFor too many students in America, ZIP Code still determines how far they'll go. And that's not acceptable. Some of you probably have friends or family who are just as smart or talented or as capable as you, but they didn't have the same support or the right opportunities or didn't get in the right school, and so now don't have the same shot at success. Am I right? Because I know that's true in our family. Michelle and I, we've got cousins and friends who we've known since they were tiny, shorties, little kids—[laughter]—and they—we know how smart they are because they were just as smart as we were, but just the luck of the draw was, they didn't get the same chance as we did. And that's not right.\nSo that's why I started something called \"My Brother's Keepers\" initiative, because what we want to do is help more young people—especially kids of color—get mentorships and the resources and the guidance they need to succeed. And I'm going to stay involved with that even after I'm done being President. Because we all have a part to play in making sure every single child has every single opportunity to achieve his or her dreams.\nThat's what Banneker is all about. That's what you can see in somebody like Ifunanya. I mean, that's an incredible young lady who's going to succeed because she has an incredible school in addition to an incredible family. And so we're so proud of her.\nThere's another person I want to just call out, Amari McDuffie. Where's Amari? Where's Amari? There she is right there, right in front. So, hey, Amari. [Laughter] I'm going to talk about you for a second. [Laughter]\nSo Amari was born with a heart and a lung condition. And sometimes, she had to miss a lot of school because of her illness. And you know, Banneker is a pretty rigorous school, so she was worried about staying on top of her work. But everybody in this family rallied around her and made sure she was keeping up. Her history teacher, Mr. Goldfarb—where's Mr. Goldfarb? Is he here or did he cut assembly? [Laughter] So Mr. Goldfarb came to visit her when Amari was in the hospital for weeks, bought a—brought a card from the whole class. And so Amari, she was talking about the support everybody here gave her, and she said, \"I believed in myself because my teachers believed in me.\"\nAnd that's the kind of community that we want in every school, where you're looking out for each other and you're taking care of one another. And so now Amari plans to be a doctor so she can help kids who had illnesses like hers. And that's what's possible when we're all committed to each other's success; when we understand that no matter what you look like, where you come from, what faith you are, what—whether you're a boy or a girl—that you should have great opportunities to succeed. And that requires you to put effort into it.\nMichelle and I talk a lot, because we travel around the world, and sometimes, we forget that there are places around the world where people have so little, but the kids are so hungry for an education. And they don't even have an actual roof over their head in some of their schools. And so even if you're really poor in this country, you can succeed if you want to invest in the teachers and the community and everybody raises standards and believes in each other. And that's what we want all of America to believe, in every kid, because there's magic in each and every one of you. And we just have to help you unleash it and nurture it and realize it.\nAnd, by the way, it's because of young people like you that I leave the Presidency never more optimistic than I am right now, because I've met so many young people around the country whose energy and excitement and how you treat each other with respect. That gives me a lot of confidence, a lot of faith for our country.\nSo I know you guys are going to keep on working hard. You're going to keep making our communities proud. If us adults do our part and we stay focused on making sure every school is as great as this one and that every young person has those same opportunities and everybody has a teacher like Mr. Goldfarb looking out for them, I've got no doubt that we're going to continue to build a country where everybody has the chance to make of their lives what they will. And that's what America is all about.\nAll right. Proud of you, Bulldogs. Thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Fill out those FAFSA forms! Thank you.", "timestamp": "2016-10-17", "title": "Remarks at Benjamin Banneker Academic High School"}

Knowles-Carter; and Greg Simon, Executive Director, White House Cancer Moonshot Task Force.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119518", "text": "The President. Well, as many of you know, at my final State of the Union, in addition to talking about the progress we had made on the economic front, some of the challenges and opportunities that we saw internationally, I announced my intention to set up a Cancer Moonshot, the notion being that given the incredible breakthroughs that we've seen in medicine, the potential that arises out of cracking our genetic code, that we now have the capability to accelerate progress on a disease that's plagued mankind for years.\nAnd in invoking this idea of a moonshot, what I hoped to be able to galvanize the country around was the same sense of urgency and an all-hands-on-deck approach, where everybody pulled together—commercial drug companies, Government agencies, philanthropies, organizations like the American Cancer Society, patients organizations—all to look at where, if we really put our shoulder behind the wheel, where can we make the biggest impact as quickly as possible.\nAnd to make this thing work, I could not think of somebody who is better to be in the mission control chair than my Vice President, Joe Biden, and our outstanding Second Lady—I don't know how can I—what's the phrase we use?\nJill T. Biden. Captain of the Vice Squad. [Laughter]\nThe President. Captain of the Vice Squad. That's what it is. [Laughter] I knew there was a phrase there. [Laughter]\nI couldn't think of better folks to make this thing work than Joe and Jill. Now, part of it obviously is because of how profoundly they've been touched by the disease. But the truth is, all of us have. As some of you know, my mother died of cancer when she was younger than I am today. And there's not a family that, in some way, has not been impacted.\nBut given Joe and Jill's passion for the issue, but also the incredible organizational skills that Joe has shown in the past in mobilizing things like the Recovery Act, I thought that he was ideally suited for this project. He energetically and enthusiastically took on the challenge. Jill energetically and enthusiastically joined him. And what we're now doing is releasing a report: the results of the last 8 months of really intensive work by Joe and Jill, but also a terrific team. And what they've done is to mobilize researchers, scientists, doctors, hospitals, tech companies, as well as philanthropies and patients advocacy organizations, and traveled around the country and internationally in order to really figure out, how are we going to get this thing to achieve a serious liftoff?\nAs Joe will detail, what we've discovered is that the boundaries of medical knowledge around cancer, the fact that we now understand that what we used to lump together as one cancer might end up being 10 different cancers; the fact that we now have potential ways of treating the disease that don't just involve surgeons or people applying radiation or chemotherapy, but we are having all sorts of disciplines now participating; our ability to identify early people who may have a proclivity for a certain kind of cancer and take preventive action faster; the capacity of big data to analyze cohorts and our ability to now start our pooling together hundreds of thousands or millions of genetic samples that rapidly accelerate our ability to engage in research—all these things have been the subject of incredible work by this team and Joe and Jill.\nAnd so although we're going to be leaving soon, what I think we're going to be able to leave behind is a architecture and a framework for organizing these efforts over the next several years. And we're already beginning to see results as people across disciplines who previously were working in isolation are now joining together and realizing we've all got one objective.\nAnd so I could not be prouder of the work that Joe, Jill, and this team have done. I gladly am going to be accepting this report, and more importantly, I'm looking forward not only to laying the ground work for the next administration to pick up the baton and run with it, but I know that Joe and Jill and I and Michelle will all continue to be involved after we've left this office in making sure that this works.\nSo thank you, Joe, for the great work.\nVice President Joe Biden. Well, thank you, Mr. President. And thank you—I'm going to give you the report. I want to——\nThe President. This is the executive summary.\nVice President Biden. Executive summary. Here——\nThe President. The report is much fatter. [Laughter] And I'm looking forward to all of you reading it.\nVice President Biden. Well, Mr. President, thank you for the trust you gave Jill and me to do this. And as you said to me early, early on, it's clear, folks, that the Vice Presidency has no power, it's all reflective of the President's confidence. And the fact that you made clear and you laid out how you expected the administration to respond has given me very wide authority to coordinate all the agencies of Government that had any possible impact on this fight. And they've been incredibly cooperative.\nMr. President, in 1971, when Richard Nixon declared the war on cancer, he had no army, he had no school, he had no weapons. And the culture, the medical culture that surrounded the beginning of that effort is fundamentally different—should be fundamentally different—than it is today. Now we have, after 40 years of enormous accumulation of data, research, and brilliant minds who have devoted their attention to this, we've reached an inflection point, Mr. President. This is what we learned when we tried to figure out, like every family does, how to deal with Beau's cancer.\nWhat we found out is, even 5 years ago, Mr. President, immunotherapy was viewed as some voodoo science; that is, how do you get the immune system to be energized and triggered to go out and kill the cancer in your body? Well, there's enormous breakthroughs that are being made. But before, the oncologists never worked with immunotherapists. They didn't work with virologists. They didn't work with chemical engineers and biological engineers.\nSo we started with our administration, Mr. President. And in addition to the obvious candidates to be engaged in this and have been engaged—from NIH to the National Cancer to HHS—we found out that there were other areas that were incredibly important—for example, NASA is now involved. Why? Because radiation, when it's used to kill what is left over from whatever the tumor has excised, it does enormous damage, sometimes more damage than the cancer. And so there's new technologies. Nobody has better technology than NASA in how to deal with radiation, because that's what all our astronauts are constantly bombarded with. And so we've also gotten involved—the Department of—the Patent Office to move quickly.\nSo my point is, they have all cooperated and brought in all these new disciplines. In the private sector, Mr. President, the same thing is beginning to happen. And first, it was not on my watch. But now, for example, Mr. President, drug companies are realizing that taking more than one of their therapies or one of their drugs from different companies in combination may have a profound impact on curing and/or drastically damaging the cancer. And—but before, they wouldn't share it.\nBut so what we came up with is essentially a prelicensing agreement. There are all these drug companies are putting in all their drugs that they're experimenting with, ones that they have yet to get patents on—and saying, have at it, gentlemen and ladies, the researchers. And they know that if something comes from it, it's like when you stick money in a jukebox, you play a song—you're going to play a song by Beyoncé or whomever—there's already a licensing agreement. She gets a share of what gets dropped in the box. The same thing is happening.\nSo, Mr. President, the private sector stepped up as well. You have IBM having contact with Greg Simon, who heads this effort for me, and saying, we're prepared to work with the VA hospitals using Watson to go out and analyze all the tumor biopsies that are out there and find patterns. And it's the single largest hospital in the world, with the most cancer patients assembled any one place. We're going to find patterns in what causes this disease. Microsoft is engaged with us now, and providing—and Amazon—space in the cloud for genomic information, for the genomic data common.\nSo, the point is, Mr. President, that the fundamental thing I come away with is that there is a need for a greater sense of urgency, because there is—there are available answers now to some cancers, and there is enormous opportunity in sharing data. You have our Department of Energy being able to do a million-billion calculations a second. If you could aggregate all the cancer data in one spot, imagine the capacity of being able to analyze all that to find patterns and what—why a particular therapy works on you, but not on me, works on one patient, but not another. So there's real excitement.\nAnd the second thing, Mr. President, that I came away with—and I'm going to be leaving here and going over—there's 200 oncologists, researchers, virologists, philanthropists, et cetera, over in the OEB. And, Mr. President, I'm going to release the Task Force report that you authorized me to organize. And it has another 35 specific recommendations beyond the 45 that were already put forward.\nBut the essence of it all gets down to one thing: We need a culture in 2016 that matches the accumulation of information and data we now have that did not exist when this culture was set up in 1971. That's what everybody seemed to be arriving at, and it's really exciting, Mr. President.\nI am confident, absolutely confident that we'll be able to accomplish in the next 5 years what otherwise would have taken us 10 years. I am confident we're going to find new prevention techniques out there. For example, the HPV virus now in fact is able to be—there's a vaccination you can have to prevent our children from getting cervical cancer, throat cancer, a whole range of other things.\nSo, Mr. President, in conclusion, I look forward to the day when your grandchildren and my grandchildren and their children show up at the office to get their physical to start school and get a shot for measles and they get a vaccine that affects significant numbers of cancers. We are very close to reaching that point and finding out what is the fundamental root cause of what makes a gene not turn off, a rogue gene, a cancer gene continue to eat up parts of the body. And I'm really optimistic, Mr. President.\nAnd thank you again for the confidence in letting me lead this effort. And like you said, in my case, I'm going to devote the rest of my life to working on this. And I think we're perilously close to making some gigantic progress.\nThe President. Well, you've done a great job. Jill has done a great job.\nTwo other things that I just want to note. Number one, because of Joe's really active engagement with Congress, this has strong bipartisan support.\nVice President Biden. It's true.\nThe President. And we are hopeful that the already significant funding stream that goes to NIH and other Government agencies is significantly supplemented and directed by the work that Joe and Jill have done.\nSecondly, this all comes down to, how does it impact patients? And so Joe, I think, has done a great job in engaging people who are going through battling cancer right now and finding ways that we're not just coming up with cures, but we're also making sure that these systems are set up so that they're easier for people to access, so that there's a broad, diverse group of people who are subject of studies so that—because, as Joe said, what may work for an Asian American man may not be the exact same treatment or approach that might work for a young Caucasian woman. And that means that we've got to bring in data sets and engage communities across America and not just a sliver.\nAnd the fact that this team has done so much work to reach out to every corner of the country is reflective of the fact that this is an issue that binds us together. This is a common enemy. And we're really lucky to have such a great couple of generals here to help us charge the mountaintop.\nVice President Biden. Mr. President, let me make one concluding statement. Two reports you're asking for. One is a vision statement: where we go from here, what we have to do. The second is a much thicker report that I'm going to be delivering to the Task Force that lays out all the things we recommend being done right now.\nThe President. Right.\nVice President Biden. And so, again, Mr. President, thank you for your confidence in me.\nThe President. Good. Great job. Thank you, everybody.\nQ. Mr. President—[inaudible]?\nThe President. We're talking about cancer today, Bill [Bill Plante, CBS News]. Thank you, sir. Thank you.\nAppreciate you. Thank you, guys.\nThink we can take at least about a 5-minute break from that? Thank you.", "timestamp": "2016-10-17", "title": "Remarks on Receiving Vice President Joe Biden's Report on the Cancer Moonshot and an Exchange With Reporters"}

Watch it here.\nThe campaign also recently released a Medium post on the Russian hack that Donald Trump refuses to admit or condemn laying out an important question that voters deserve to know - \"What did Trump know, and when did he know it?\" Read it here.\nHere are 15 facts you should know about Donald Trump, WikiLeaks and Russia:1) The U.S. intelligence community has concluded that top Kremlin officials are behind the hack of the DNC and other Democratic organizations to influence the elections – and named WikiLeaks as part of their effort.\n* Washington Post:\"Intelligence officials have identified WikiLeaks and other sites as among those receiving or publishing information from Russian intelligence, a claim that Assange has dismissed in the past.\n2) According to the Wall Street Journal, \"FBI Suspects Russia in Hack of John Podesta Emails\"- top Russian officials meanwhile shifted away from denying a role in separate hacking of the Democratic National Committee.\n3) Long time Trump campaign associate Roger Stone says he is in contact with Julian Assange. Stone unwittingly admitted the Russians are the source for WikiLeaks when he said, \"The DNC heist documents…were hacked and first made public by Guccifer 2.0, almost a month ago, and when that did not get the appropriate traction, he took them to WikiLeaks who then leaked them.\"  Stone also seemed to predict Podesta's emails would be released as far back as August, suggesting possible collusion.\n4) According to reports, \"several current and former officials who have worked in the Justice Department,FBI and intelligence community said they have little doubt federal law enforcement is looking into the different questions surrounding the different current and one-time Trump campaign operatives.\n5) Julian Assange's own ties to the Kremlin are extensive and well-documented:\n* Assange hosted a talk show on Putin's propaganda network, RT.\n* Forbes: The Breathtaking Hypocrisy of Julian Assange, Kremlin Pawn\n* A recent New York Times examination of Assange's time in exile found that WikiLeaks' activities have consistently benefitted Putin's Russia at the expense of America and our allies.\n* National security experts have criticized Assange and WikiLeaks for doing Putin's bidding by releasing documents obtained by Russian hackers:\n* Defense One: How Putin Weaponized Wikileaks to Influence the Election of an American President:\"Considerable evidence shows that the Wikileaks dump was an orchestrated act by the Russian government, working through proxies, to undermine Hillary Clinton's Presidential campaign.\"\n* Former NSA analyst and counterintelligence officer, John Schindler: \"Russian hackers working for the Kremlin cyber-pilfered the DNC then passed the purloined data, including thousands of unflattering emails, to Wikileaks, which has shown them to the world. This, of course, means that Wikileaks is doing Moscow's bidding and has placed itself in bed with Vladimir Putin.\"\n* National Security expert Michael Weiss: \"In a bizarre mind-meld that could only happen today, the WikiLeaks founder is refusing to say whether he got the hacked DNC emails from Russia, and Trump is defending Putin.\"\n6) Trump was reportedly briefed by U.S. intelligence officials before the last debate that Russian intelligence services were behind the hacks. Despite that information, Trump stood on the debate stage and claimed to 80 million Americans that it could be anyone including someone \"sitting in their bed who weighs 400 pounds.\" Why?\n* NBC News: \"A senior U.S. intelligence official assured NBC News that cybersecurity and the Russian government's attempts to interfere in the 2016 election have been briefed to, and discussed extensively with, both parties' candidates, surrogates and leadership, since mid-August. 'To profess not to know at this point is willful misrepresentation,' said the official. 'The intelligence community has walked a very thin line in not taking sides, but both candidates have all the information they need to be crystal clear.'\"\n* WaPo: Headline: \"Trump refusal to accept government assessments on Russian hacks dismays former officials\"\n* \"The former officials, who have served presidents in both parties, say they were bewildered when Trump cast doubt on Russia's role after receiving a classified briefing on the subject and again after an unusually blunt statement from U.S. agencies saying they were \"confident\" that Moscow had orchestrated the attacks.\"\n7) Donald Trump himself encouraged Russian hackers to spy MORE on Hillary Clinton:\"Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\" Trump said. \"I think you'll be rewarded mightily by our press!\"\n8) Trump's business interests in Russia run deep…and present HUGE conflicts of interest. Because Donald Trump won't release his taxes, the full extent of his Russian business interests that could conflict with American national security interests is largely unknown. But just some of the recent headlines have revealed hundreds of millions of dollars related to Russian business interests; connections to business groups with ties to the Kremlin like Bayrock; business dealings with alleged Russian mobster Felix Sater and a 30-year history of pursuing business with Russia including the Miss Universe pageant. Trump's son has said that \"Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section\" of the Trump Organization's assets and that \"we see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.\"\n9) Trump's policies are concerning experts because they align closely with Putin's agenda, contrary to American interests.\n* Op-ed by Former U.S. Ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul:\"Putin has rational motives for wanting Trump to win: Trump champions many foreign policies that Putin supports. Trump's most shocking, pro-Kremlin proposal is to \"look into\" recognition of Crimea as a part of Russia…. Trump has demanded that other NATO members essentially pay us for protection… Trump has also disparaged our allies in Asia, creating new opportunities for Russian influence…. On the whole, Trump advocates isolationist policies and an abdication of U.S. leadership in the world. He cares little about promoting democracy and human rights. A U.S. retreat from global affairs fits precisely with Putin's international interests.\"\n* Vox:Trump's policies are objectively pro-Russia. \"Nothing Russia could do, on its own, would help its foreign policy more than what Trump is proposing. He is literally suggesting the United States transform global politics to make it more favorable to Russian interests.\"\n* Slate:Putin's Puppet: If the Russian president could design a candidate to undermine American interests—and advance his own—he'd look a lot like Donald Trump. \"Donald Trump is like the Kremlin's favored candidates, only more so. He celebrated the United Kingdom's exit from the EU. He denounces NATO with feeling. He is also a great admirer of Vladimir Putin.\"\n* Politifact:\"Trumps [sic] comments on backing away from NATO, supporting Russia on the Ukraine and rethinking sanctions against Russia certainly qualify as statements that dovetail with what the Putin administration would like.\"\n10) Former Acting CIA Director Michael Morrell has concluded, \"In the intelligence business, we would say that Mr. Putin had recruited Mr. Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation.\"11) The Trump campaign's ties to Russia are deeply disturbing.\n* One-time Foreign Policy Adviser Carter Pageis being probed by U.S. intelligence agencies for meeting with sanctioned Kremlin officials including Igor Diveykin.\"A former Russian security official, Diveykin now serves as deputy chief for internal policy and is believed by U.S. officials to have responsibility for intelligence collected by Russian agencies about the U.S. election, the Western intelligence source said.\"\n* The Trump campaignlied about Page having \"never been a part of our campaign. Period\" to cover up his involvement. In fact, Trump announced Page himself to Washington Post editorial board back in March 2016 as one of his foreign policy advisers, which was confirmed by Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks to CNN.\n* Campaign Chair Paul Manafortwas forced to resign after the New York Timesrevealed, \"Handwritten ledgers show $12.7 million in undisclosed cash payments designated for Mr. Manafort from Mr. Yanukovych's pro-Russian political party from 2007 to 2012…Investigators assert that the disbursements were part of an illegal off-the-books system whose recipients also included election officials.\"\n*  Gen. Michael Flynn, the adviser who joined Trump for his classified intelligence briefing, has beenpaid by Kremlin-run RT and sat two seats downfrom Putin at the outlet's 10th anniversary gala. \"The presence of such an important figure at Putin's table startled current and former members of the Obama administration. 'It was extremely odd that he showed up in a tuxedo to the Russian government propaganda arm's party,' one former Pentagon official told me. Like Trump, Flynn has advocated forging closer ties with Russia.\"\n* Mike McSherry, an aide who helped lead Trump's convention strategy, worked alongside Manafort and Gatesto lobby for Putin puppet Yanukovych.\n* Howard Lorber, a Trump economic adviser, traveled with Trump to Moscow in the 1990s seeking real estate deals.Lorber was just the the \"latest in a long list of relationships that give Trump a financial stake in warm U.S.-Russian relations.\"\n* Boris Epshteyn,a senior Trump adviser and surrogate, moderated a 2013 forum at the \"Invest In Moscow!\" Conference and has echoed Kremlin talking points on TV. As a surrogate for Donald Trump's campaign he argued that Russia has not seized Crimea from Ukraine, even though Vladimir Putin seized the region more than two years ago. While discussing the GOP nominee's recent remarks about Putin on CNN Sunday, campaign surrogate Boris Epshteyn said, \"First of all, Russia did not seize Crimea.\"\n* Richard Burt,who has been an adviser to Trump and helped write his first major foreign policy speech, has deep ties to Russia as well. Burt sits on the board of directorsfor the US-Russia Business Council, formerly sat on the senior advisory board of Russia's Alfa Bank, and has argued against S. sanctions on Russia.\n* Michael Caputo,a former top Trump adviser who also recently resigned, had acontract with Russian conglomerate Gazprom Media in 2000 to improve Putin's image in the United States.\n12) Trump allies, WikiLeaks and Russia pushed a nonsensical conspiracy theory about the DNC hacks. \"Trump campaign surrogates are fueling a conspiracy theory that a murdered Democratic National Committee staffer was connected to the hacking of the DNC, a theory being pushed by WikiLeaks and the Russian state-controlled press. Some experts have gone as far as to say that Putin is explicitly using Trump to further his agenda.\"\n13) Even top Republicans have raised serious concerns about Trump's relationship with Putin's Russia. 50 G.O.P officials warned that Donald Trump would put the nation's security at risk: \"They viewed Mr. Trump's comments on NATO as an abandonment of America's most significant alliance relationship. Mr. Trump has said throughout his campaign that he intends to upend Republican foreign policy orthodoxy on everything from trade to Russia, where he has been complimentary of President Vladimir V. Putin, saying nothing about its crackdown on human rights and little about its annexation of Crimea.\"\n14) Top Democrats on four House committees that oversee national security on Friday called on the FBI to investigate Donald Trump's purported ties to the Russian government and its alleged hacking of Democratic groups and operatives.\n15) Trump has praised Putin for a decade, and Putin has returned the favor.\n* Trump, 2007:\"[Putin's] doing a great job. In rebuilding the image of Russia and also rebuilding Russia period. Forget about image.\"\n* Trump, 2011:\"I often speak highly [of Putin] for his intelligence and no-nonsense way…. Putin has also announced his grand vision: the creation of a 'Eurasian Union' made up of former Soviet nations that can dominate the region. I respect Putin…\"\n* Trump, 2013,on Putin's NYT op-ed denouncing American exceptionalism: \"I thought he did an amazing job…. He's making him look like a -- he's the professor and the President is a school child… He really becomes with this letter, almost, the world leader\"\n* Trump, 2013:\"Do you think Putin will be going to The Miss Universe Pageant in November in Moscow - if so, will he become my new best friend?\"\n* Washington Poston Trump's 2013 Miss Universe Contest in Moscow: \"Putin canceled at the last minute, but he sent a decorative lacquered box, a traditional Russian gift, and a warm note\"\n* Trump, 2014:\"Putin has become a big hero in Russia with an all time high popularity.\"\n* Trump, 2015:\"In terms of leadership, [Putin's] getting an 'A,' and our president is not doing so well.\"\n* Putin, 2015on Trump: \"He's a really brilliant and talented person, without any doubt.\"\n* Trump, 2016:\"[Putin] called me a genius, I'm going to disavow it? Are you crazy? Can you believe it? How stupid are they.\"\n* AP, 2016:Russia's Putin Reaffirms Praise for Trump, Calling Him 'Bright'", "timestamp": "2016-10-18", "title": "Clinton Campaign Statement on Donald Trump's Comments on Meeting with Putin"}

NCLR's investments in training workers, empowering the next generation of students and leaders, and supporting families are a model for the work we need to do across America.\n\"As President, I'll proudly work alongside organizations like NCLR to take on the issues that keep Latino families up at night – from creating good jobs with rising incomes in every zip code to passing comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship. Together, we'll reject the hateful rhetoric that has been directed at Latinos and too many others throughout this election, and open doors of opportunity for Latinos in every corner of our country.\n\"The stakes have never been higher, and I'm humbled to receive this historic endorsement from NCLR PAC. As voters head to the polls in states across the country, it's critical that Latinos make their voices heard in this election. With so much on the line, now is the time for people from all walks of life to stand up and vote for the kind of country we want to be: a country where we build bridges, not walls; where we're stronger together; and where every child can live up to his or her God-given potential.\"", "timestamp": "2016-10-18", "title": "National Council of La Raza Action PAC Endorses Hillary Clinton"}

The United States and Italy are working together bilaterally and through the NATO Alliance on international security and humanitarian efforts such as the Counter-ISIL Coalition, Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, and the refugee and migration crisis in the Mediterranean. Italy is a strong partner and leader in the global effort to counter terrorism and violent extremism, and is one of the largest troop contributors to the Counter-ISIL Coalition. The Italian Carabinieri forces are leading the way in training thousands of police in Iraq, a key component of the Coalition's efforts to secure and stabilize Iraqi cities and towns after they have been liberated from ISIL. Within NATO, Italy provides troops for the Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan, focused on training, advice, and assistance for the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces. Italy also serves as the Resolute Support Mission framework nation for the western region of Afghanistan. In addition to its significant troop contribution, Italy provides vital financial support for the Afghan security forces. In addition, Italy is the third largest contributor to NATO's Kosovo Force (KFOR) operation and is one of seven NATO Allies that is a framework nation for NATO's Very High Readiness Joint Task Force. We are also working closely with the Italians to support the Libyan Government of National Accord and its efforts to remove ISIL and other terrorists from Libya. Italy is the second-largest host to U.S. troops in Europe, providing a home to over 30,000 U.S. military and Department of Defense civilians at installations across Italy.\nStrong Economic Ties:  Our two countries benefit from a close economic and commercial relationship. The United States is one of Italy's most important trade partners, with two-way trade in 2015 totaling over $80 billion. The United States is Italy's largest non-European export market; Italy is our 12th-largest trading partner. Italian direct investment in the United States supports over 127,000 U.S. jobs, and U.S. direct investment in Italy supports over 200,000 Italian jobs. Between five and six million American tourists visit Italy each year.\nScience, Technology, and Innovation: The United States and Italy are committed to addressing climate change, reducing carbon emissions, and promoting clean energy development. Italian and U.S. officials meet every two years at the U.S.-Italy Joint Commission Meeting (JCM) to discuss ongoing areas of scientific cooperation and to propose new working groups. The 2015 Action Plan included working groups on natural hazards, agriculture, advanced materials, health, information and communication technologies, and preserving cultural heritage. The next JCM, hosted by the United States, will take place January 13-14, 2018, in Washington, D.C.\nCultural Exchange and Heritage: Robust educational exchange programs serve as a foundation for fostering people-to-people ties between the United States and Italy. Italy is the second most popular destination for American students, hosting approximately 30,000 annually, after the United Kingdom.\nThe Commission for Educational and Cultural Exchanges between Italy and the United States (the Fulbright Commission) is one of the oldest and largest in Europe. Since the Commission was established in 1948, approximately 10,000 U.S. and Italian students, teachers, lecturers, and researchers have been awarded Fulbright grants. The Business Exchange and Student Training (BEST) program brings young managers and entrepreneurs in science and engineering to the United States to pursue academic coursework and training in entrepreneurship. Since 2001, the United States and Italy have been partners in a bilateral agreement protecting Italy's cultural property by reducing the incentive for looting of archaeological sites in Italy and preventing the illicit trafficking of cultural objects from Italy.", "timestamp": "2016-10-18", "title": "Fact Sheet: United States-Italy Cooperation"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122595", "text": "Today's Actions Respond to Executive Order Issued on April 15 to Spur Competition, Build on Strong Record to Create a More Transparent, Lower Cost, and Higher Quality Experience for Consumers\nMore than 700 million passengers are expected to board 9 million domestic airline flights in America this year. The sheer volume of people, flights, and miles underscores how fundamental air travel is to the American economy and to the lives of so many people across the country. The Administration's actions will spur competition in the airline industry.\nWhen American families and workers travel—whether for a long-awaited vacation or to get to a last-minute meeting—they deserve to know exactly what they're buying. And they deserve to get what they pay for—without hidden fees or last-minute complications. Before the Obama Administration came into office, airlines were able to hide fees, shield their actual performance from consumers, and increase prices even after consumers had booked their tickets. That wasn't fair, and it stifled transparent competition.\nBut in 2009, as part of the President's efforts to promote more competition and protect consumers, the Obama Administration undertook an overhaul of the rules of the road. Through a series of new regulations, for example, the Administration has given consumers new tools. Today, consumers can easily determine the full fare for a flight, hold a reservation without payment or cancel reservation within 24 hours, get real-time updates from airlines about delayed flights, and feel confident that, if they get bumped from a flight, they will be properly compensated.\nToday, the Department of Transportation is announcing a series of new executive actions to build on that strong record. These actions answer the President's Executive Order that called for more competition that helps consumers, workers, and entrepreneurs. Together, the actions announced today will help consumers know how airlines are performing, make sure consumers don't have to pay for services they don't receive, and help consumers find the best flight options. That will create a more competitive market, with better outcomes for American consumers.\nØ      REQUIRING REFUNDS FOR DELAYED BAGGAGE: Passengers should not be charged for services they do not receive. For example, if passengers are charged a fee by an airline for their checked baggage, they should expect to receive that baggage in a timely manner. The Administration has already taken steps to require airlines to reimburse bag fees when bags are lost; today, DOT is issuing an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to require airlines to refund baggage fees when a passenger's luggage is substantially delayed.\nØ      MAKING THE AIRLINE MARKET FAIRER, MORE TRANSPARENT: Today, the Department is releasing new final rules that will provide consumers more information and prohibit airlines from cherry-picking data about their performance. The rules will:\n•      STOP AIRLINES FROM DATA CHERRY-PICKING: Require the big U.S. airlines to report performance for any plane that flies under their banner - ensuring that the large carriers have to faithfully report on all domestic flights under their brand, not just the ones they select. To meet this goal, the new rule will require the big airlines to report data for flights of their domestic code-share partners (i.e. flights by generally smaller, regional airlines that are sold under the brand of the larger airline) to make these airline performance reports more complete.\n•      PROHIBIT UNDISCLOSED BIAS BY AIRLINES AND ONLINE TICKET AGENTS: Prohibit online ticket agents – the platforms on which many consumers compare and book flights – from undisclosed biasing of flight offerings on behalf of certain airlines to make shopping for air travel more transparent and fair for consumers.\n•      PROTECT TRAVELERS WITH DISABILITIES: Require large U.S. airlines to report on how often they mishandle wheelchairs so air travelers with disabilities can easily compare carriers and make informed travel decisions.\n•      PROVIDE CONSUMERS A CLEARER PICTURE OF BAGGAGE DELIVERY: Overhaul the methodology large U.S. airlines use to report mishandled baggage, so it better informs passengers of their actual chances of receiving their checked baggage in an acceptable and timely manner. Instead of tallying passenger reports of lost baggage and comparing that to the overall number of travelers, airlines will be required to report the total number of mishandled checked bags and the total number of checked bags.\nIn addition to these final rules, DOT is conducting a separate rulemaking to explore protecting consumers from surprise fees:\n•      EXPLORING REQUIREMENTS ON AIRLINES TO PROVIDE CONSUMERS WITH ALL-IN PRICING INFORMATION: Today, many services or products airlines previously included in the price of a ticket such as checked baggage, advance seat assignments and priority boarding are sold separately. DOT will be conducting a rulemaking to explore whether airlines should be required to share fee information for such services or products with ticket agents, so that customers can get an all-in-one price when they shop online. DOT will also determine which fees will have to be included, potentially including baggage fees, seat assignment fees, and change and cancellation fees.\nThe Department of Transportation is also releasing a Request for Information on whether airlines unfairly restrict access to schedule and fare information:\n•      REVIEWING POTENTIALLY UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES: Some airlines currently prevent online travel sites from listing certain sets of the airline's fare and flight options. DOT will be looking into whether that kind of restriction is an unfair practice that makes it harder for travelers to find the most affordable and convenient flights that match their needs. Today, DOT is publishing a Request for Information to solicit feedback from consumer groups, industry, and other stakeholders to advance DOT's understanding of these market dynamics and to help DOT determine whether any regulatory or enforcement action is warranted.\nØ      GIVING CONSUMERS A VOICE: Today, DOT is announcing the selection of the new members of DOT's Advisory Committee for Aviation Consumer Protection, including New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu who has been selected to serve as Chair of this Advisory Committee as well as to represent state and local governments on the Committee. New Committee members also include: David Berg from Airlines for America, Mario Rodriguez from the Indianapolis Airport Authority, and Charlie Leocha of Travelers United. Since 2012, the Committee has given consumers a voice within DOT, leading DOT to place more educational information on its website to help consumers understand airline services, require airlines to make websites and kiosks at airports accessible for people with disabilities, and expand the airlines that report service quality data such as on-time performance data to the Department. To provide the public an opportunity to discuss important consumer issues and help address issues that do not have simple answers such as how to make the airline market more competitive, the Committee will meet twice a year at the DOT's headquarters in Washington, D.C. This meeting will be open to the public and comments by members of the public are invited. Additionally, DOT will stream the event live on the Internet.\nIn the months ahead, the Department of Transportation will finalize additional rules that will address:\n•      Whether to require travel agents to adopt minimum customer service standards – like the right to cancel a reservation within 24 hours and receive a prompt refund – in order to ensure consumers are treated fairly; and\n•      Whether to define what type of entity the Department considers a ticket agent to make it clear that all companies that market air transportation must follow the same consumer protection rules.\n*****\nToday's Actions Build on a Strong Record of Standing Up for Airline Passengers\nUnder President Obama, the Federal government has provided a substantial boost to airline passenger rights and protections. Today's actions build on rules issued in December 2009 and April 2011 aimed at enhancing airline passenger protections.\nThe 2009 and 2011 rules prohibited airlines from forcing passengers to remain stranded onboard aircraft on the tarmac for more than three hours on domestic flights and more than four hours on international flights, with exceptions for safety, security and air traffic control related-reasons. The tarmac delay rule has virtually eliminated excessive tarmac delays.\nThe Department's pro-passenger rules have also made travel simpler and easier for consumers in a number of other ways including by:\n•      requiring airlines to reimburse passengers for bag fees if their bags are lost;\n•      allowing passengers to hold a reservation made directly with an airline without payment or cancel a reservation within 24 hours without penalty, if the reservation is made one week or more prior to a flight's departure date;\n•      providing consumers who are involuntarily bumped from oversold flights with greater compensation;\n•      requiring carriers to disclose fees for baggage, meals, canceling or changing reservations, and other optional services on their websites;\n•      requiring airlines to promptly notify consumers of delays of over 30 minutes, as well as cancellations and diversions; and\n•      mandating that advertised and listed airfares must be the entire fare to be paid by the consumer, including all government taxes, in every advertised price.\nA Strong Enforcement Record. The Administration has also had a get-tough approach to enforcing consumer protection rules which has led to millions of dollars in sanctions. Since 2009, the Department has taken more enforcement actions, through cease and desist orders, than in the preceding 12 years combined­. These orders have assessed over $32.5 million in civil penalties for violations of airline consumer protection and disability rules. Among these are precedent-setting orders against airlines for violations of rules regarding the enplaning and deplaning of travelers with disabilities, the fair treatment of family members and survivors in the wake of aviation disasters, and rights of passengers during tarmac delays.", "timestamp": "2016-10-18", "title": "Fact Sheet: Obama Administration Announces New Actions to Spur Competition in the Airline Industry, Give Consumers the Information They Need to Make Informed Choices"}

We're going to take it back. [applause]\nAnd while I'm at it, make sure you mail in those ballots before election day. Early voting starts on the 24th, you've got to mail them in. But get there, November 8th.\nI'd like to also start today by recognizing the incredible military contributions of Colorado Springs, a place I actually know very well. One of the most beautiful places, by the way. We have such amazing people working at Fort Carson, Peterson Air Force Base, the United States Space Command, NORAD, Schriever Air Force Base and the United States Air Force Academy. Good place. [applause]\nI've got many friends that went to the Air Force Academy, all very smart. They love their airplanes, that I can tell you. The courage and selflessness of our service members and their devotion to each other and to their country are the traits that we need to make America great again. [applause]\nGreat people. Together, we're going to deliver real change that puts America first. You don't hear that term very much. We don't hear that term very much anymore, do we? America first, right? If I win, it's going to be America first every single time, that I can tell you. Believe me. [applause]\nWe're going to end the government corruption and we're going to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C. [applause]\nWe are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees from other countries, reduce surging crime, cut taxes big league and end regulations. [applause]\nUnleash job-producing American energy, rebuild our great military, which sadly has become very depleted, but the greatest people on Earth. We're going to take care of our veterans like they have never been taken care of before. And repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. [applause]\nYour jobs will come back under a Trump administration. Your incomes will go up under a Trump administration. Your taxes will go down under a Trump administration. [applause]\nYour country and I tell you, your country is so proud of you, but right now we have to help our country. We have to help our country. It is under siege in so many ways. By the way, you could almost stay, especially from the dishonest media, that's for sure. [applause]\nVery dishonest. Your companies won't be leaving Colorado under a Trump administration. They'll be expanding and there will be new companies coming in. Right now, we're not growing at all as a nation. You look at our jobs report, a disaster. Last week a jobs report, total disaster. Look at our GNP, total disaster.\nUnder my plan, we're going to grow at 4 percent. Right now, we're at about 1 percent. [applause]\nChina's at 7 percent. India's at 8 percent. We're at 1 percent and it's going to be going down if we keep if Hillary Clinton gets in, you will set record lows, believe me. That I can tell you. [applause]\nWe're going to create at least 25 million new jobs in 10 years. And by the way, did you see the protesters yesterday, where they call them. The protesters are paid a lot of money by the DNC. And I kept saying, I wonder why those people are here? Because they never seem to have much on their mind, other than stand up and protest.\nAnd yesterday it came out, but it was barely covered by the media. But it's all over the media. They were busted. They were paid $1,500 each and were given cell phones go up and disturb Trump rallies. And I sort of always knew it, in Chicago, even last night. We had people stand up for no reason. It's like, what are they doing here? And can you imagine, that's a big story, hardly covered by the media. [applause]\nSo bad. We're also going to create a new government that answers to the people. Hillary Clinton—Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to run for the presidency. [applause]\nShe shouldn't be allowed to run for the presidency after what she's done. I'll tell you. It's true. Newly released, two days ago, FBI documents reveal just how deep the corruption goes. The undersecretary of state, Patrick Kennedy, illegally pressured the FBI to unclassify e-mails from Hillary Clinton's illegal server. [applause]\nIt's hard to believe. And nothing happens to her, folks, and nothing ever happens. In other words, the State Department was trying to cover up Hillary's crime of sending classified information on a server our enemies could easily access. [applause]\nThe FBI document show that Patrick Kennedy made the request for altering classification as part of a very, very serious quid pro quo. Not allowed to do it. This is a felony corruption. Yesterday, I said Undersecretary Kennedy must immediately resign. [applause]\nThe media barely covers this event, by the way. [applause]\nThis is a bigger event than Watergate and they practically refuse to cover it. Today, I'm calling for him to be fired. [applause]\nClinton and her cronies have sacrificed your security, your family's safety and your country's safety as though it meant nothing at all to her. [applause]\nRemember also that Hillary lied under oath to Congress, saying that she never sent or received classified information on her secret server. Right? She never received it on that insecure server, that she should have never been allowed to have. That you're not allowed to have. And pretended not to know. Remember this one: that the letter \"C\" meant confidential information was classified. [applause]\nShe thought it was the lettering of a paragraph. [applause]\nThere's never been a time in our country's history where anything like this has gone on. And the FBI, there must be people in there, based on what you read, that are ashamed of what's happened. And the Department of Justice, there must be people in there that are ashamed, absolutely ashamed of what's been going on.\nHillary then told the FBI she couldn't remember 39 times. And then in written testimony last week, under oath, she said that she couldn't remember another 21 times. Bad memory. She's got a terrible memory. [applause]\nThis elaborate, criminal cover up included Hillary's deleting and bleaching of 33,000 e-mails. The disappearance of 13 iPhones, some by hammers, two boxes of e-mail evidence gone missing, that was as of last week. Can you imagine they're now missing on top of everything else, two boxes of e-mails? And the destruction of laptops, in a secret deal with the FBI. [applause]\nThis truly is, and I said it, this truly is many times worse than Watergate. And we're going to put an end to it on November 8th. [applause]\nGoing to do it. [applause]\nAnother series of leaked e-mails show top officials in the Clinton campaign scheming to take massive sums of money from registered foreign lobbyists. And then you wonder why we do so badly. But you don't hear the media talking about that at all, do you? You don't see it at all. As WikiLeaks proved, the media, is merely, and it truly is, it's just an extension of the Clinton campaign. [applause]\nThe press has created a rigged system and poisoned the mind of so many of our voters. They have rigged it from the beginning by telling totally false stories. Most recently about phony allegations where I have been under constant attack. They attack my business. I built a great business but, although most people do admit that. They attacked my wonderful family. They attacked my temperament.\nBut I built an incredible company, those papers are filed. And I'm fortunate to have a beautiful and loving family. You all saw Melania last night on television. Did a great job. [applause]\nThat she even has to do that is a shame. And my temperament has always been just about my greatest strength. We have a winning temperament. Our country doesn't win anymore. We don't win anymore. This is an election about truth. And you're not going to get it from the dishonest media.\nSome people can't handle the truth. No matter what people may think of me, the one thing they know is that we're going to tell the American people where we stand, where we are. We're going to tell them the truth. [applause]\nNow even though we're doing pretty good in the polls, I don't believe the polls anymore. I don't believe them. I don't believe them. And if there's 10, and if there's one or two bad ones, that's the only one they show.\nBelieve me, folks, we're doing great. If we keep our spirit, and if we go out and win, this is another Brexit, believe me. They are so worried. That's why they've become vicious and hostile and dirty because they see what's going on. This rally set up just a short while ago; look at the number of people, packed. But every rally is the same way. [applause]\nAt her rallies, very few people show up, when she has the energy to go to the event. Which isn't often. She's doing debate prep. She did so much debate prep. Did we beat her badly in that second debate? [applause]\nSort of funny. She's been doing this for 30 years. Now she has to do debate prep for five days. You know what the debate prep is? It's resting. It's lying down, going to sleep. I think the media's trying to discourage our people from going out to vote. And it was just brought up to me by a reporter in the back.\nThey said, you know, it's very interesting, when you were fighting 17 people, the media was nasty, but they really got nasty when we started to take the lead in the polls. They said, \"Wait a minute, this thing's going to happen. It's going to happen.\"\nChange stop our jobs from leaving, our companies from leaving, strengthen our military, preserve our Second Amendment. They're saying, this is going to happen. And it is true. Made up stories. They're liars and made up stories.\nWithout the media and all of the other corrupt entities that have helped her along the way, she would be nothing. She would be nothing. She really—she would be doing so badly. Even my worst critics agree that the media has come after us like they have never come after anyone before. It's my badge of honor.\nI mean, you know, what am I going to do? Even the New York Times, which is totally dishonest, by the way—here's the good news about the New York Times. They won't be in business much longer. Do you see what they're losing? [applause]\nThey are dying. They are dying. And they're dying also because they're very dishonest. But one of their biggest columnist-reporters wrote a story about how bad it is. He said, let's face it—this is in the New York Times \"balance has been on vacation since Mr. Trump stepped onto this golden Trump Tower escalator to announce his candidacy.\"\nCan you believe that? They're admitting it. They don't even care. It actually said that we don't care. They will do anything to stop what we're doing. Not me, it's what we're doing. It's an agenda. It's going to agenda of change. But we won't let them stop maybe the greatest movement in the history of our country.\nHistory is watching us now, waiting to see if we will rise to the moment. We have to rise. We have to do it. We're under tremendous opposition. We have the greatest people in the world. That's what I've learned. Somebody said, what's the most important thing you learned? How great the American people are. I've gone all over the country.\nI have two things I've learned that, and I've learned how totally dishonest the media is. It's so dishonest. I've learned that, too. They are the most dishonest people I've ever dealt with. Not all of them, but, honestly, like 75 percent. Some are very good, but for the most part, yes.\nWe have stories that we think are going to unbelievable stories. They turn out—they make them as bad as possible. We have stories on the other side that would normally dismantle a campaign, and they don't even report them. It's a disgrace. What's going on is a disgrace.\nBut we've only just begun to fight, believe me. We have three weeks. You know what, we have three weeks. And I hear we're going great in Colorado. My people in back said, \"You're going to win Colorado, doesn't matter what they say.\" [applause]\nGet out and vote. But they even want to try and rig the election at the polling booths where so many cities are corrupt. And you see that. And voter fraud is all too common. And then they criticize us for saying that. And we have even Republicans, \"Oh, that's such a terrible thing to say.\"\nWell, take a look at Philadelphia, what's been going on. Take a look at Chicago, take a look at St. Louis. Take a look at some of these cities where you see things happening that are horrendous. And if you talk about them, they say bad things about you. They call you a racist. They call you all—and by the way, speaking of that, nobody will do more for the African-American citizens of this country than Donald Trump, nobody, nobody. Nobody will do more for the Latino community than Donald Trump, I can tell you.\nIn 2014, the Washington Post, another beauty, published an article entitled, \"Could Non-Citizens Decide the November Election?\" The article found that 14 percent of non-citizens were registered to vote, 14 percent were registered to vote. And we're not supposed to talk about it. And your Republican leaders said, \"Oh, this—everything is peachy-dory,\" right? And it also found non-citizen voting may have given Democrats the pivotal sixtieth vote needed to pass Obamacare. It's a Washington policy, not me.\nThe system is also rigged by the donors giving hundreds of millions of dollars to Crooked Hillary's campaign. It's rigged. It's a bad system. The reason Hillary Clinton pushes for NAFTA—or the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will also be a disaster—NAFTA's the worst trade deal ever signed, ever made, by anybody in the world.\nWe're a one-way highway out. We get the drugs, right? We get the drugs. We get the unemployment. We get the empty factories. Mexico and other countries get the cash. They get the employment. They get the plants.\nAnd for completely open borders—she wants completely open borders, is because her international donors control her every move. If we let Crooked Hillary's cartel and—and just remember this—run this government, history will record that 2017 was the year that America lost, truly lost, its independence, truly lost its independence.\nAnd by the way, this is our final shot, folks. In four years, it's over. You're never going to be able to win. You're never going to be able to win. It's tilting. It's going to be a one-party system. This is your final shot for the Supreme Court, for your Second Amendment. I mean, this is your final shot, November 8th.\nSo hopefully you'll do what you know you have to do. Get out of bed and vote. No matter how you're feeling, no matter how you're feeling.\nIt is indeed time to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C. This is why I'm proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again. First, I'm going to institute a five-year ban on all executive branch officials lobbying the government after they leave government service, right?\nSecond, I'm going to ask Congress to institute its own five-year ban on lobbying by former members of Congress and their staffs. That's a simple one. And they know this should be done, but they're not going to do it, but they'll do it if I get in.\nI'm going to, number three, expand the definition of lobbyists so that we close all the loopholes that former government officials use by labeling themselves [applause]\nRight? I've been talking about that for years. Decades of failure in Washington and decades of special interest dealing must and will come to an end. And remember, by the time this ends, I will have spent over $100 million on my campaign. Hillary's spent nothing. She gets all her money from the special interest donors. And my interest is you; my interest is you. [applause]\nWe have to break the cycle of corruption, and we have to give new voices to change. And we have to—we have no—do we have a choice? So that we can have a government that works again and can function properly, which our government doesn't right now, including giving Iran $1.7 billion in cash. [booing]\nAnd remember the deportation of 800 people? Turned out to be 800 people, then went to 1,800 people.\nAnd they were going to be deported for good reason. You know, if our country deports somebody, they've got to be pretty, pretty out there. Well, they pressed the wrong button, and congratulations, we have 1,800 new citizens of the United States.\nAnd when I said, \"undo it,\" they said that wouldn't be constitutional. Hey, folks, how stupid are we being led? The time for congressional term limits has finally arrived. Not only will it end our government corruption, but we will end the economic stagnation that we're in right now. No growth.\nMy plan for the economy can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs. It will happen. [applause]\nAt the center of our historic jobs plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals, which I've wanted to do from the beginning; 47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are living right now on food stamps. It's hard to believe this is our country.\nWe have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world. And the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression. Do you know that? The worst since the Great Depression. Colorado has lost one in seven manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA, and a deal supported by Hillary Clinton very strongly.\nAnd this I thought was a typographical error, because I figured they meant 700 or 7,000, but it wasn't: We've lost 70,000 factories since China's entry into the World Trade Organization. Another Bill and Hillary backed disaster.\nWe are living through the greatest job theft in the history of the world. More jobs have been stolen from our country, so stupidly we let them go. We let our companies go so foolishly. We don't know what we're doing. A Trump administration is going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to the foreign cheating, and stop the jobs from leaving our country, and have jobs come back in the other direction. [applause]\nAs part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we're going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent. [applause]\nWe are right now the highest-taxed nation in the world. That's one of the reasons our companies are leaving. We're also going to fix our inner cities—45 percent of African-American children, under the age of six are living in poverty; 58 percent of African-American youth are not working. Almost 3,500 people have been shot in the city of Chicago.\nCan you believe this? Since January 1st. The national murder rate has experienced the largest single year increase in more than 45 years. Can you believe that? Murder, highest rate in 45 years.\nSo you don't—they don't seem to. She said, \"nobody cares.\" And you're right, they don't seem too. So to those African-Americans suffering, to those Latinos suffering, I say: What do you have to lose? Elect Donald Trump. I will fix it. We will fix it. [applause]\nWe will fix it. We're going to get a very big African-American vote. We're going to get a very big Latino vote. Because the Democrats come in, they want your vote. And as soon as you give them the vote, they say, \"See you in four years.\" They don't do anything. It's gotten worse and worse for both the African-Americans, the Latino-Hispanics. It's gotten worse and it will only get worse.\nThey want your vote. Hillary Clinton said she was going to fix up the state of New York when she ran for the Senate. It is a total disaster. We will be a rich nation once again. But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country. [applause]\nOur national security begins at the border. Speaking in secret, to a foreign bank [applause]\nI promise, we will build the wall. [applause]\nHillary Clinton said her dream is for total open trade. There go your jobs; and open borders—there goes your country. Simple as that.\nThere are already a record 65 million people in the United States who speak a language other than English. It's in their interest and everyone's interest to control immigration so past arrivals can integrate into society and really join the middle class and the upper class.\nBut in a secret speech to Goldman Sachs, she said, \"Citizens who want to control immigration are un-American.\" In other words, if you want to have a border, you want to have a wall, which creates a country. Even if you want people to come in, but come in through a legal process, she considers that un-American. So Hillary thinks most of the country is either deplorable, irredeemable, un-American, racist, or basement dwellers in the case of the Bernie Sanders people. She said they were basement dwellers. Hillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East, meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores.\nWe will be the great Trojan horse folks. As sure as you're standing there. Just today, an Iraqi refugee approved for entry by Hillary Clinton's State Department pled guilty to joining ISIS. He entered as a refugee in November of 2009. And then we approved for a green card in 2011. It's one of hundreds of examples of the United States voluntarily admitting people from the world's most dangerous places who turn out to be terrorists.\nSo let me state this as clearly as I can. If I'm elected president of the United States, I am going to keep radical Islamic terrorist the hell out of our country. We have enough problems. [applause]\nWe have enough problems. We've got big problems: $20 trillion in debt. We have problems like you wouldn't believe. We'll also stop the crisis of illegal immigration. A Trump administration will secure and defend our borders. And we will build that wall and Mexico will pay for that wall. [applause]\nWe just got the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol Office. First time they've ever done it. ICE was just last week. As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released because their home countries would not take them back. They were too evil. They were too evil drug lords, heads of gangs. I mean these people were evil. They wouldn't take them back.\nSo we come over, we bring, they won't take them back. Oh, take them back, drop them on the streets. And then you wonder why the murder rate is the highest in 45 years and other things.\nThe ICE officer described Hillary's proposal as quote, \"The most radical immigration proposal in U.S. history.\" Here's a summary of the Hillary plan. She wants to support sanctuary cities.\nShe wants Social Security, Medicare and lifetime welfare for illegal immigrants by making them all citizens. They get taken care of better than our great vets. That won't happen. She wants Obamacare for illegal immigrants. Obamacare is not going to be here much longer, folks. You see what's going on. Regardless. No deportation of Visa overstays. Expanding catch-and-release on the border. She wants it expanded. In other words, catch them and say, \"Oh, you can go.\"\nExpanding President Obama's unconstitutional executive amnesty, including instant work permits for millions of illegal workers. Freeing even—there go your jobs—freeing even more criminal aliens by expanding Obama's non-enforcement directives.\nAnd this is to me, the beauty of them all. Obama has allowed thousands and thousands and thousands of people to come in, Syrians from the Middle East. She wants an increase of 550 percent in Syrian refugees into our country. [booing]\nEither we win this election, or we lose our country. Under a Trump administration, it's going to be America first. [applause]\nHere are some of the amazing things we're going to do for our country starting in 2017. We're so close. We have to get it over the line. We're so close. Forget the press. Read the internet, study other things, don't go for the mainstream media. Most of them—good news—fortunately most of them won't be around very much longer, in my opinion. They're going down. Financially, big trouble. A lot of big trouble. They've got a lot of big trouble. That's good.\nWe're going to have—and I do get a lot of honesty over the internet. You do get some dishonesty, too, but at least you can separate it. We should have a choice. We're going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan and maybe even bigger. We're going to eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation. We are going to defend religious liberty, provide school choice to every low- income child in America. And get rid of common core so that we can have education locally. [applause]\nWe are going to support the men and women of law enforcement. [applause]\nLaw and order and justice. Law and order and justice. We are going to save something that is under tremendous stress. We're going to save your Second Amendment. [applause]\nAnd we're going to appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. [applause]\nYou have 21 days to make every dream you've ever dreamed for you family, for your grandchildren, for you children, for yourself, for your country to come true. Our campaign is powered by our love for this country and our love for our fellow citizens. There's a lot of love in this room. A lot of love. And we don't want a divided country. We want to bring other people. We want to love everybody in our country. It's a campaign about rejecting the cynicism and the elitism of our failed political establishment. On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington, D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter. That's you, and you.\nI am going to fight so hard for every citizen, of every background, for every single stretch of this nation. I am going to fight for every child living in poverty. I'm going to fight for every mom whose lost her child to illegal immigration and drugs and gang violence, and the viciousness that it all builds.\nI'm going to fight for every community whose jobs and factories have turned into dust. And those jobs and factories are not with us any more. They're in other countries, making everybody rich but us. [applause]\nI'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people, not the donors and the special interests. [applause]\nAnd with all the money she made, she doesn't put up any money into her own campaign. That's pretty remarkable. I'm doing it. I'm going to fight to bring us all together. We're not going to be divided anymore as Americans. Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people, under one God, saluting one American flag. [applause]\nThank you. In 10 years, in 20 years, in 30 years, you're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this beautiful day in this great state and in this truly great country. This is a movement that they have never seen before. They've never seen anything like this before. There has never been like this before.\nYou're going to look back at this election and say, \"This is by far the most important vote, you've ever cast, for anyone at any time.\" [applause]\nOnce again, we're going to have a government of, by, and for the people. [applause]\nYou will see, and be so proud of your country again and hopefully you'll be so proud of your president again. [applause]\nWe will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again.\nThank you, everybody. God bless you. November 8th, go out and vote. November 8th. God bless you, everybody. [applause]", "timestamp": "2016-10-18", "title": "Remarks at the Norris-Penrose Event Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado"}

In his remarks, the President referred to Agnese Landini, wife of Prime Minister Renzi; and actor Sophia Loren. He also referred to his mother-in-law, Marian Shields Robinson.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119519", "text": "President Obama. Good morning!\nAudience members. Good morning!\nPresident Obama. Buon giorno!\nAudience members. Buon giorno!\nPresident Obama. Today is bittersweet for Michelle and I because this marks the final official visit and state dinner of my Presidency.\nBut——\nAudience members. Aww!\nPresident Obama. It's okay. [Laughter] We've saved the best for last. And so on behalf of Michelle and myself, and on behalf of the American people, it is my great honor to welcome, from Italy, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and Mrs. Agnese Landini.\nAs Americans and Italians, we're here because of each other. America's Founding Fathers—Washington, Jefferson, Adams—drew inspiration from Cincinnatus, Cicero, Cato. Prime Minister Renzi, you've spoken with great emotion about the American soldiers of World War II who liberated Italy so that families like yours could live in freedom. Today we again pay tribute to all those who risked their lives—and often gave their lives—including the heroes of the Italian Resistance, so that we can stand here today as two free peoples.\nAnd on a personal level, today is a chance for Michelle and me to reciprocate the incredible warmth and hospitality that the Italian people have shown us on each of our visits to Italy. When, years ago, Michelle and I traveled through Tuscany, back when we didn't have kids so we could have a really good time. [Laughter] You remember that? [Laughter] Then, when, in my first term, we brought our daughters to Rome to experience the timeless beauty of the Eternal City. And when Michelle and our daughters and my mother-in-law went to Milan for last year's Expo. All of which has prompted Malia and Sasha to ask the question posed by generations of visitors to Italy: When can we go back? [Laughter]\nOf course, this visit also reflects the deep friendship between our two peoples and the Americans' love of all things Italian. We love the food. We love the fashion. We love the wine. We love Sophia Loren. [Laughter] And nowhere does our love for Italy run deeper than among the millions of very proud Italian Americans, including those who are here today.\nNow, I'm not fortunate enough to claim Italian anecestry myself, although my name does end in a vowel. [Laughter] But I do consider myself an honorary Italian. I was raised in part by my grandmother, and as any Italian will tell you, you listen to your nonna. [Laughter] And because of Michelle, like every good Italian home, the White House now has a garden, with tomatoes and garlic. [Laughter]\nLet me also say that in the Italian American experience—immigrants who often came here with nothing, who had to learn the language and carve out new lives, and who overcame prejudice and discrimination, relying on the love of family and the strength of their faith, and then have gone on to succeed in every walk of life—we see a truth that we must never forget, and that is that America was built by immigrants, America is stronger because of immigrants, America is great because of immigrants.\nAnd as President, I'm especially grateful for my partnership with my good friend, Matteo. I mean, look at him. He's young, handsome. He's put forth a vision of progress that's not rooted in people's fears, but rather in their hopes. He knows that, as nations, as an—individuals, we have the power to achieve great change. In Italy, he's challenging the status quo with bold reforms. He likes to tweet a lot. [Laughter] We also have in common the wisdom to marry remarkable women, leaders in their own right, who have dedicated their efforts to giving children every opportunity to succeed, including a good education to our sons and our daughters.\nSo I'm told that there's an Italian saying—forgive my accent—\"Patti chiari, amicizia lunga.\"\nPrime Minister Renzi. Wonderful!\nThe President. So, roughly translated, it means that clear conditions lead to long friendships. When it comes to Italy and the United States, the underlying conditions could not be more clear. We're united not only by our interests, but also by our values: by our love of liberty, by our commitment to the dignity of every human being, which is why I can say without hesitation that Italy is one of our strongest allies and one of our closest friends.\nAnd in Italy, and in Prime Minister Renzi, the United States has a partner with whom we share a common vision: inclusive, growing economies that create opportunity and reduce injustice and inequality; a Europe that is whole and free and at peace; a strong NATO alliance committed to our collective defense and united in the face of aggression and terrorism; empathy for the migrant and compassion for the refugee; partners in clean energy as our generation takes the boldest steps ever to save our planet from climate change; and partners in development, because when Italians and Americans work together, we can help save the world's most vulnerable people from the ravages of hunger and disease.\nAs our Italian friends know, Matteo began his life of faith and service in the Scouts. And ever since, he's been guided by the words of the Scouts' founder: \"Leave this world a little better than you found it.\" Well, Matteo, Agnese—and to the Italian people—we are proud to call you allies and friends, today and always, because we know that when we stand together as Americans and Italians, we can leave the world a little better than we found it.\nSo, to all of you, welcome to the United States. Benvenuti amici miei.\nPrime Minister Renzi. Mr. President, Mrs. Obama, my American friends, cari amici italiani e italoamericani: Thank you for such a warm welcome here. President Obama organized very perfectly everything, also the sun. Incredible organization. [Laughter] And Agnese and I are delighted to be here. It's an incredible honor, it's an incredible gift, this opportunity, on this solemn occasion, to celebrate the relation between our two nations. Obviously, we are ready in every moment to host you and your family: in every moment, as also in every city, also Florence. [Laughter] But we are so, so excited for this occasion and this opportunity.\nThe enduring friendship and the bond between our countries has never been so strong, so deep, and so wide. Italy and the United States work together globally, fighting terrorism, providing security, creating economic opportunity. But I think, Mr. President, if you think about our history, we can imagine five centuries ago when a young Italian called Amerigo Vespucci gave his name to America. And 70 years ago, so many young Americans sacrificed their lives to give freedom back to Italy. Thank you again to these people.\nToday, we, together, we are facing the challenge of give the name to a new era together: a new era, a new season full of opportunities, also full of uncertainties. But my personal opinion is, the name of the future has to be freedom. The name has to feature—has to be education, not intolerance; sustainability, not destruction; trust, not hate; bridges, not walls. The name of the future has to be growth, not austerity. And in a time of fear, we have to give answer with audacity of hope, not only in United States.\nMr. President, Italians love history. The Romans used to say, \"Historia magistra vitae\"—history is a teacher of life. We think history will be kind with you, Mr. President. Under your leadership, a country hit by crisis started growing again. Day after day, you have made change that improved lives, helped environment, and created opportunities for poor people.\nI think there are a lot of people who think that politics is only about screaming, fighting each other. Hate creates division. You are different, Mr. President. We are different. We think politics is making a difference. And this is the reason: Because we love history, but at the same time, we need a future. We love our past, but we need the future.\nIn the history of Italy, there are a lot of incredible personalities—Michelangelo, Leonardo, Galileo—the most incredible geniuses of the past. But they are not our stakeholders. Our stakeholders in this time are our children, the future of the new generation. And for this reason, I think Italy is ready to build with United States of America a great season of new opportunities, a future—common future—based on strengths, civil rights, education, culture, soft power—the real great bond between the United States and Italy.\nSo, Mr. President, we have a great poet, Dante Alighieri, who used an expression—wonderful. I am not able to translate in English, I'm sorry. \"Fatti non foste a viver come bruti, ma per seguir virtute e canoscenza.\" Fatti non foste a viver come bruti. It means our mission is not full of brutality, but full of values and knowledge. This is the choice for us today. This is the mission for the new generation of politician. This is the ambition. I think we will never be tired of being a true friend, a solid partner, of United States of America.\nIn this spirit, thank you so much for your leadership, Mr. President. And thank you so much for your friendship. We are so honored to be here, because here is there is heart and our identity. Viva gli Stati Uniti d'America. Viva l'Italia. Viva la libertà.", "timestamp": "2016-10-18", "title": "Remarks at a Welcoming Ceremony for Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy"}

Please, everybody, have a seat. Salve. Once again, I want to welcome Prime Minister Renzi and his delegation back to the White House. As we all saw this morning, Matteo's English is much better than my Italian. Michelle and I are looking forward to hosting Matteo and Agnese at tonight's state dinner. But as I believe our Italian friends say, prima il dovere, poi il piacere—[laughter]—which means \"first duty, then pleasure.\" Tonight's dinner will be a pleasure. Today we're focused on our duties: our work to advance the security and the prosperity of our peoples.\nI want to begin by once again expressing our deep gratitude, as Americans, for the extraordinary alliance with Italy. The United States is lucky to have many strong allies around the world. Few are as strong and as reliable and as capable as Italy. In good times and in bad, we can count on each other. And I want to thank the Government and the people of Italy for the hospitality and the generosity they show to the many American military personnel and families who are stationed in Italy, far away from home.\nMatteo, please also know that our thoughts continue to be with the people of Amatrice. And I know that you're still working closely with local governments there to recover and rebuild from the devastating earthquake that took place this summer.\nIn our work together over the past 2 years, I've come to count on Prime Minister Renzi as one of my closest partners and friends on the world stage. By virtue of his progressive vision, his energy, the reforms that he's pursuing—which are sweeping—the bold vision that he has for Italy and the world, I think Matteo embodies a new generation of leadership, not just for Italy, but also for Europe. And this is critically important because, as I've said repeatedly over the last several years, a strong and united and confident and prosperous Europe, anchored in liberal traditions and democracy and rights, that's a necessity for the United States, and it's a necessity for the world. It's a strategic interest of ours that we have a successful, united Europe. And today we focused on a number of key challenges facing Europe, our trans-Atlantic alliance, and the globe.\nOn the economic front, we agree that our focus has to remain on growth, creating jobs and prosperity for our people. Matteo has been pursuing some very bold economic reforms, structural reforms in Italy that are not easy, that are often resisted by existing institutions and inertia. But the Italian economy has shown signs of growth. It still has a long way to go to put Italy on a path to long-term and sustainable growth. And the upcoming referendum to modernize Italy's political institutions are something the United States strongly supports because we believe that it will help accelerate Italy's path towards a more vibrant, dynamic economy, as well as a more responsive political system.\nMatteo shared his thoughts on how, in the wake of Brexit, the European Union can move forward and focus on delivering security and prosperity that Europeans deserve. And we both agreed that without an emphasis on demand and growth, and investment in infrastructure and projects that can put people back to work—particularly young people—that much of the economic fragility in Europe will continue. And by the way, that has an impact around the world, including on the American economy as well. We both reaffirmed our strong support for negotiations around the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which can support jobs and exports and innovation and growth on both sides of the Atlantic.\nWe talked about, as NATO allies, our unified determination to defend every ally and to continue to strengthen NATO's defense and deterrence posture. Italy will be a key contributor to NATO's Joint Task Force, which is now operational and can deploy anywhere in Europe on short notice. We discussed our shared concerns around the situation in Ukraine and the importance of keeping sanctions, including EU sanctions, in place until Russia and Ukraine are both implementing commitments under the Minsk agreement. And we are determined to work diplomatically with the Normandy Group in order to achieve that goal.\nI thanked Italy very strongly for its leading role in the coalition against ISIL. After the United States, Italy is the second largest contributor of forces in Iraq. Italian forces are helping to stabilize cities through its training of police after they are liberated from ISIL. The start of Iraqi operations to liberate Mosul is another major step forward. Mosul, as many of you know, is Iraq's second largest city, and ISIL has been entrenched there for more than 2 years. Perhaps a million civilians are still living there. And so, in addition to rooting out ISIL, our focus jointly is on the safety and the humanitarian aid for civilians who are escaping the fight. That's going to be a top priority for both our governments.\nMy—Mosul will be a difficult fight, and there will be advances and there will be setbacks. But I am confident that just as ISIL has been defeated in communities across Iraq, ISIL will be defeated in Mosul as well, and that will be another step towards their ultimate destruction. Meanwhile, Italy continues to be one of our strongest counterterrorism partners as we work together to prevent terrorist attacks in our countries.\nMore broadly, we agreed to continue our strong support of the Libyan Government of National Accord, which, as we've seen in recent days, continues to face challenges to its authority. Italy provided critical diplomatic support to Libya's efforts to forge the Government. Together, we intend to continue to support the Government of National Accord as it works to eject ISIL from Libya, provide stability and services throughout the country. And as ISIL tries to expand its presence in Afghanistan, Italy continues to play a vital role as we train and assist Afghan forces and support Afghan development.\nWe discussed the continued need for strong, coordinated responses to the largest migrant and refugee crisis in Europe since World War II. As the leader of EU's naval operation in the Mediterranean, Italy and its partners have helped to save hundreds of thousands of lives. As NATO agreed in Warsaw, the alliance is moving ahead with plans to increase its support of these EU operations. And, Matteo, I want to commend you and the Italian people. For the leadership in Europe that you have shown as an eloquent voice for a collective, orderly, and humane response to this crisis is in keeping with our values and our shared commitment to human dignity.\nAnd finally, the past two weeks have been a powerful reminder that when our countries work together we can leave the world a little bit better than we found it. Because the United States and Italy joined with other nations across the globe, we've brought the Paris Agreement on climate change into force. We reached an agreement to limit aviation emissions. And through the Montreal Protocol, nearly 200 nations just this past week agreed to phase down production and consumption of dangerous hydrofluorocarbons, which are a enormous contributor to greenhouse gases and a major step towards achieving the goals that we set in Paris. Meanwhile, Italy continues to be a strong partner for development, especially to combat hunger and malnutrition around the world.\nSo, once again, Matteo, thank you for your friendship. Thank you for your partnership. I could not ask for a better partner. And the American people could not ask for a better friend and ally than Italy. So grazie.\nPrime Minister Renzi. I'm not sure your Italian is worse than my English because——\nPresident Obama. It's slower anyway.\nPrime Minister Renzi. ——you improve very quickly, your Italian.\nMr. President, grazie mille.\n[At this point, Prime Minister Renzi spoke in Italian, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nPrime Minister Renzi. Thank you. Thank you kindly for the reception. What we said about the great honor which is here today for Italy is something I'd like to confirm, is something that I'd like to underline with great strength. But as President Obama said, our meeting was also an occasion to talk about our duties, and after that, to talk about pleasure.\nIn those topics that have to do with our political times, I want to thank the United States of America for the extraordinary support for the battle that Italy is having in our country, within Europe to affirm a paradigm of growth and not only of austerity at all levels. The United States are a model in this sense, 2008-2016. Constantly, your country has indicated, shown us the way of how to get out of the biggest crisis after the war. I believe that Europe can and should do more. Italy considers the American example as the reference point in this battle.\nOf course, we also know that we have to do our homework at home, the structural reforms. And therefore, what the President just reminded us of is the priorities, starting with the labor market reform.\nI had to ask for his forgiveness because I used the expression, \"Jobs Act,\" which is obviously something that I copied. But this is something that is open source, and I think that we can copy each other's expressions from the great initiatives that were set forth by the Obama Presidency. This has created 588,000 new jobs in Italy, which for Italy are still insufficient, but at least they are a first step to leave our difficult situation.\nThank you, President Obama, for the work you've done as a leader in the energy field. Today, Italy is one of the main nations that sustains and upholds the vision of COP 21 in Paris. We will be working in Marrakesh in November. The next few years, we will be working in this direction in order to have clean energy, sustainable environment for our children.\nAnd thank you for the work that we've done together in the field of culture—in the cultural field. I believe that we find ourselves in a season of our political lives. Maybe some people choose hatred, the culture of intolerance. We have to bet on liberty. We have to bet on our identity, the values that make this country extraordinary. And Europe—Europe has a desperate need to find its own soul. And this is due to its children. This is due to its grandchildren. So this is the first topic of conversation that we had with President Obama.\nIn terms of Italy, we want to make sure that the G-7, in Taormina, in Italy, in the beautiful Sicily is an important, a relevant appointment, and we commit ourselves, because the work that we began together, dear President, under your Presidency may continue. The legacy of President Obama not—will not only remain in the United States. This has to be absolutely clear and absolutely loud. It will involve the Europe, and we feel totally committed in this direction.\nAnd finally, before I talk about international policies, I want to tell you that we thank you for remembering Amatrice. Amatrice is a small village in the center of Italy which has been affected by a dramatic earthquake. It's also the town where pasta all'Amatriciana was born. This is one of the typical products of Italy. And so this small community at Amatrice that had so many dead has not left its courage.\nDear President, when you come to visit Italy in the next few months, I believe that we will want you to taste, thanks to the cooks in Amatrice, one of the best pastas that you have ever tried in your life, particularly pasta all'Amatriciana. I think that this is a way of saying to this community—where a community that has been folded by this terrible tragedy—that food can be an element of identity in the future.\nIn terms of our international policies, the Italian agenda is in agreement with the American agenda. We are thoroughly convinced of the need to affirm values of being able to live together, of being civil throughout the world. That's why we commit ourselves to work with the international coalition in all theaters, starting in Iraq, in Mosul, where Italian troops are supporting an operation to save the dam in Mosul. And we believe that it's fundamental, it's crucial not to succumb to the culture of fear. In the future, we cannot know what will happen, but if there's a great inheritance left by the American Dream, this is the best way to proceed.\nRecently, a lot has been said about innovation and technology, and this has made people think that the future is a threat. I am completely convinced that in Italy and the United States we can help the new generations to think of the future not only of—think of this as a great opportunity. And for this reason, the agenda that the United States has presented today is an agenda that we agreed upon and we will be working together on it.\nThank you so much, Mr. President.\nPresident Obama. Okay, we're going to take a few questions. And I will start with Kevin Freking of AP.\nRussia-U.S. Relations/Republican Presidential Nominee Donald J. Trump/Federal Bureau of Investigation/Department of State\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton talks too tough about Vladimir Putin and that both of you insult the Russian leader. He also said that, if elected, he might meet with the Russian leader before his Inauguration. What do you think of Trump's approach to Putin? And how would it affect America's interest on the international stage?\nSecondly——\nPresident Obama. I can still hear.\nQ. Secondly, does it distress you that folks at the FBI and State Department talked about the proper level of classification of e-mails that were on Secretary Clinton's server? Would you acknowledge the appearance of impropriety? And should State Department officials look into this further?\nAnd for Prime Minister Renzi, with the critical governing referendum happening soon in your country, what would passage mean for your ability to lead that country? And what would failure mean to your political future, as well as to Italy's role in the European Union? President Obama. Well, I'm going to be a little more subdued in my discussions of the Republican nominee in this context than I might be on the campaign trail. But let me just speak broadly about Russia.\nWhen I came into office, Russia, under the previous administration, had invaded parts of Georgia, had created a frozen conflict there. There was a new President, and we tried to initiate a more constructive path with respect to U.S.-Russia relations. And I think we showed Russia plenty of respect, acknowledging enormous differences and different values, but also trying to find ways in which we could cooperate together.\nWe initiated the New START Treaty. We assisted Russia with respect to its ascension to the WTO. We worked on some common international challenges together. And when the previous President was replaced with Mr. Putin, I met with him and we discussed again ways in which we could constructively work together.\nThe challenge that we've had with Russia is very much centered on Russian aggression in some very particular areas around the world. In Ukraine, where they have engaged in similar conduct to what they did in Georgia, and even there, we've tried to broker, and work with the Europeans to broker, a Minsk agreement that would peacefully resolve those issues.\nIn Syria, one of my earliest meetings with Putin was to suggest to him that if Asad stayed in power, given the brutality with which he had treated his own people, you would see a civil war that would not be good for the Syrians, certainly, but would not be good for the world anywhere. Rather than to work with us to try to solve the problem, he doubled down on his support for Asad, and we know the situation that exists there.\nSo any characterization that somehow we have improperly challenged Russian aggression or have somehow tried to encroach on their legitimate interests is just wrong. And Mr. Trump's continued flattery of Mr. Putin and the degree to which he appears to model many of his policies and approaches to politics on Mr. Putin is unprecedented in American politics, and is out of step with not just what Democrats think, but out of step with what, up until the last few months, almost every Republican thought, including some of the ones who are now endorsing Mr. Trump.\nSo you'll have to explain to me how it is that some of the same leaders of the Republican Party who were constantly haranguing us for even talking to the Russians and who consistently took the most hawkish approaches to Russia—including Mr. Trump's selection for Vice President—now reconcile their endorsement of Mr. Trump with their previous views.\nThe bottom line is, is that we think that Russia is a large, important country with a military that is second only to ours, and has to be a part of the solution on the world stage rather than part of the problem. But their behavior has undermined international norms and international rules in ways that we have to call them out on. And anybody who occupies this office should feel the same way, because these are values that we fought for and we protected.\nWe can't go around talking about human rights or freedom of the press or democracy or freedom of religion or nondiscrimination or basic laws of war or the sovereignty and territorial integrity of countries no matter how small and then extoll the virtues of somebody who violates those principles.\nAnd Mr. Trump rarely surprises me these days. I'm much more surprised and troubled by the fact that you have Republican officials who, historically, have been adamantly anti-Russian and, in fact, have attacked me for even engaging them diplomatically, now supporting and, in some cases, echoing, his positions. It's quite a reversal. You'll have to ask them how to explain it.\nWith respect to the State Department and the FBI reports, I think you've heard directly from both the FBI and the State Department that the notion or the accounts that have been put out there are just not true. And you can question them again, but based on what we have seen, heard, learned, some of the more sensational implications or appearances, as you stated them, aren't based on actual events and based on what actually happened and, I think, derive from sort of overly broad characterizations of interactions between the State Department and the FBI that happen a lot and happen between agencies.\nI think that covers me.\nPrime Minister Renzi. What the forum—I know 2016 is not a very good year to organize a referendum. But I think the Italian referendum is very simply a message because it's about the fight against bureaucracy. And we need a great investment against bureaucracy in Italy for a lot of reasons. We changed 63 governments in 70 years. A few times, we joke about it with the President, because it's unbelievable in a country to have a government change 1 year—every year. But it's normal. The discussion, the political discussion is very strong.\nMy opinion is very easy. If in December we will win this referendum for Italy, it will be easy—more easy to continue the battle to change Europe, because structural reforms are important for Italy, but are important also for institutions in Brussels—in Europe.\nSo the only consequence, constitutional reform apart, in the political debate in my view is, if we win, Italy will be stronger in the debate in EU. And so I work strongly and hardly to achieve the victory.\nAh, sorry. Platero, Sole 24 Ore.\nQ. Grazie.\nPrime Minister Renzi. You're American, not Italian.\nQ. I'm American; I'm Italian.\nPrime Minister Renzi. American citizens.\nQ. I will ask the question in English—or in Italian.\nPrime Minister Renzi. Okay.\n[A reporter spoke in Italian, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nU.S. Economy/European Union\nSo let's talk about the referendum, because you hope to win, of course. But we've found many investors at Wall Street who are worried about the fact that you might lose the referendum. These are investors that have faith in Italy and that threaten, if there is a negative result in terms of the reforms, to just leave. So what can you tell these investors in order to reassure them to—if there is a negative outcome, will you stay on? Will you continue with the reforms?\nAnd one last thing. This evening, will you bring some wine to the dinner with the President? This is an Italian custom.\n[The reporter spoke in English as follows.] Q. I agree with the Prime Minister, your accent is beautiful, truly beautiful.\nThe President. Grazie.\nQ. So your Italian accent, of course.\nThe President. I've got my hands to—grazie. [Laughter]\nQ. Yes. On growth, you seem to be in agreement that there is a need to sort of go ahead with the policy that you have pursued on being more flexible on the fiscal side. The problem is that Brussels is very rigid about it. And it's very rigid with the Italian efforts, therefore jeopardizing these efforts. What can you say to Brussels, especially after Brexit—they don't seem to be moving on that front—how important it is to move forward in that direction? And do you think that in case the referendum will not go well for the Prime Minister, he should stay on and continue in his reforms? Thank you.\n[Prime Minister Renzi spoke in Italian, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nPrime Minister Renzi. I have a feeling— and I think that rightly so—our American friends are a little bit more interested in November 8 than in the Italian vote on constitutional reform. And so are we, might I add.\nBut in terms of what you were asking, very, very briefly, this is a time in which many investors throughout the world are coming back to invest in Italy. We're extremely happy about this. We're happy about the investments on innovation in terms of technology. Apple is investing in Naples. Amazon is going to open an artificial intelligence center in Turin. So for the entire economic and financial world, well, they're starting to see Italy as an area in which to create opportunities and business, therefore, open doors.\nI don't believe that there will be any major disasters if the \"no\" wins at the referendum. But in order to have no doubts, I'd rather win the referendum. I'll do everything I can do; this atavistic doubt will not be able to come about. But what is fundamental, what is true is that the message goes through. This referendum does not have to do with the great world events, the great world issues. Very simply: Do you want to simplify the institutional system in Italy, giving greater stability and certain times in which to have greater stability? This is something to simply things in our country.\nAnd based on the question that was asked to the President on Europe, we do respect the European rules, and we're totally inside the European rules, although sometimes we do this halfheartedly. We'd like to do things differently. But so long as rules don't change, we will respect them, because Italy has made of its reputation one of the key words in its mandate. We work to change them, but if they're there, we are going to respect them.\nNow, what will happen within the next few months will be seen, as a great singer—Italian singer says—we will discover this by living. So I'm almost certain that the \"yes\" will win so you will have no grounds to ask this question.\nPresident Obama. During the course of my Presidency, I have had repeated conversations with Brussels, with Angela, with François, and others around how we could most effectively recover from the crisis of 2007, 2008. It is fair to say that we have made more progress more quickly. And what I've tried to point out was, the reason we were able to make progress was, we focused very early on in providing a large infusion of demand through our fiscal policies: rebuilding roads, bridges; investing in schools, teachers, clean energy; putting people back to work; tax cuts, put money into pockets of consumers; saving the auto industry. But then, also, what was very important was quickly trying to fix the banks and infusing capital and making sure they were more stable, more transparent, and would attract confidence so that the financial system was working again.\nAnd look, I'm proud of our economic track record. We have grown faster and created more jobs and, this past year, seen incomes rise and poverty fall more quickly than a lot of our counterparts in Europe.\nNow, I recognize that Europe is a more complicated collection of states and it's more difficult to move and some are in the euro zone and some are not. And so I don't expect that everything we've done can immediately translate to Europe. And there's some parts of what Europe does that we could learn from in terms of the social safety net, for example.\nBut what I do know is that given the very slow growth that's taken place in Europe, or contraction, over what is almost a decade now, you have a generation of European youth who are not attaching themselves to the labor market fast enough. And if you don't reverse some of those trends, then it becomes a generational loss of income, of wealth, of economic dynamism.\nAnd now that countries like Italy and others have made real progress on their finances and their deficits and there's more market confidence in their position, now would be a good time, I believe, to refocus attention on growth and making investments. Because one of the reasons that we've been able to cut our deficits by two-thirds is not simply because we cut spending by two-thirds. We disciplined spending, but we also grew fast enough that more revenue came in. And that's one of the best ways for you to arrive at a sound fiscal position.\nAnd monetary policy alone is not sufficient. I think Mario Draghi and the European Central Bank have done good work trying to maintain a positive trajectory in Europe. But ultimately, there's only so much monetary policy can do if it's not combined with fiscal policy. And my hope would be that—Matteo is right, Italy has been true to its word in Europe and met its obligations—but my hope would be, the debate broadens as Europe moves forward around how to grow more quickly, put more people back to work, see incomes rise, create a greater sense of momentum and optimism. Because I do believe that there is a connection between stagnation and some of the less constructive populist impulses that have been rising up.\nAnd those trend lines about Europe do concern me, because if you look at the European experiment over the last 40 years—I said this in Hannover—there's probably been no group of people who have enjoyed more prosperity and more peace over the last several decades than a united Europe. If it begins now splintering because their sense is, the global capitals and elites are not attentive to the ordinary concerns of people, that would be a tragedy. And my hope is that that discussion, led by Matteo and others, will continue.\nAnd by the way, yes, I think if—I won't weigh in on the referendum, but the reforms Matteo is initiating, certainly on the economic side, are the right ones. And in a global, Internet-driven world, governments have to be able to move fast and quickly and transparently. And so I am rooting for success, but I think you should hang around for a while no matter what.\nAyesha Rascoe [Reuters]. 2016 Presidential Election/U.S. Electoral System/Republican Presidential Nominee Donald J. Trump/Iraq/Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) Terrorist Organization\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like to ask you about the election. Donald Trump is telling his supporters that the election is rigged and asking them to monitor certain areas on election day. How concerned are you about the potential for violence? And what about after election day, are you worried the results of the election may be distrusted?\nAnd for Prime Minister Renzi, the offensive in Mosul has begun. Are you concerned about what happens after liberation? And, Mr. President, if you want to weigh in on that as well, I'd appreciate it.\nPresident Obama. I do.\nQ. Thanks.\nPresident Obama. Okay. One of the great things about America's democracy is, we have a vigorous, sometimes bitter, political contest. And when it's done, historically, regardless of party, the person who loses the election congratulates the winner, reaffirms our democracy, and we move forward. That's how democracy survives, because we recognize that there is something more important than any individual campaign, and that is making sure that the integrity and trust in our institutions sustains itself. Because democracy, by definition, works by consent, not by force.\nI have never seen in my lifetime or in modern political history any Presidential candidate trying to discredit the elections and the election process before votes have even taken place. It's unprecedented. It happens to be based on no facts. Every expert, regardless of political party, regardless of ideology—conservative or liberal—who has ever examined these issues in a serious way will tell you that instances of significant voter fraud are not to be found; that, keep in mind, elections are run by State and local officials, which means that there are places like Florida, for example, where you've got a Republican Governor whose Republican appointees are going to be running and monitoring a whole bunch of these election sites. The notion that somehow if Mr. Trump loses Florida, it's because of those people that you have to watch out for, that is both irresponsible, and by the way, it doesn't really show the kind of leadership and toughness that you'd want out of a President.\nIf you start whining before the game is even over, if whenever things are going badly for you and you lose, you start blaming somebody else, then you don't have what it takes to be in this job. Because there are a lot of times when things don't go our way or my way. That's okay. You fight through it, you work through it. You try to accomplish your goals.\nBut the larger point that I want to emphasize here is that there is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig America's elections, in part because they're so decentralized and the numbers of votes involved. There's no evidence that that has happened in the past or that there are instances in which that will happen this time.\nAnd so I'd advise Mr. Trump to stop whining and go try to make his case to get votes. And if he got the most votes, then it would be my expectation of Hillary Clinton to offer a gracious concession speech and pledge to work with him in order to make sure that the American people benefit from an effective Government. And it would be my job to welcome Mr. Trump, regardless of what he's said about me or my differences with him on my opinions, and escort him over to the Capitol, in which there would be a peaceful transfer of power. That's what Americans do. That's why America is already great. One way of weakening America and making it less great is if you start betraying those basic American traditions that have been bipartisan and have helped to hold together this democracy now for well over two centuries.\nWith respect to Mosul, we are seeing the Iraqi forces, with the support of the coalition that includes the United States and Italy and other nations, moving forward and encircling Mosul. The intention is to drive ISIL out of what was its first major urban stronghold and what continues to be one of the key organizational and logistical and leadership hubs for ISIL.\nI'm confident that we can succeed, although it's going to be a tough fight and a difficult fight. It is Iraqis who are doing the fighting. And they are performing effectively and bravely and taking on significant casualties. There will be ups and downs in this process, but my expectation is, is that ultimately it will be successful. And this will be, I think, a key milestone in what I committed to doing when ISIL first emerged, which was, we were going to roll them back and we are going to ultimately drive them out of population centers and we will destroy them and defeat them so that they are not in a position to carry out terrorist attacks against our peoples or our friends and allies or against innocent people inside of Iraq and Syria. And we've seen just steady progress on this front.\nNow, you ask a very important question, which is, if in fact we are successful, how do we deal with what could be a humanitarian crisis? Because ISIL, when it occupies these territories, it bleeds them dry. It feeds off them. It oppresses the local populations. It's not very good at governance. And so just basic functions like electricity or water start running down. People are fleeing from their homes. There will be significant displacement.\nThis has all been part of the coalition planning process in conjunction with the United Nations, in conjunction with major aid organizations. And so we have put together plans and infrastructure for dealing with a potential humanitarian crisis that are as extensive as the military plans. That doesn't mean that we don't have to pay attention to it. And executing will be difficult; it's going to still be a tough environment to operate under. And no doubt, there will be instances where we see some heartbreaking situations if in fact large numbers of people flee. It's hard when you leave your home. It's hard when you leave your home and you already didn't have a lot because you were living under an oppressive barbarous regime. It's hard to leave your home in a war zone.\nSo it's not something that I expect will be easy, but I think it perhaps hasn't been publicized enough, at least in the American press, the degree of planning and assets and resources that we're devoting to this very important problem. Because if we aren't successful in helping ordinary people as they're fleeing from ISIL, then that makes us vulnerable to seeing ISIL return and feeding on the resentments in the aftermath of Mosul being liberated. And so there's a strategic, as well as humanitarian, interest in us getting that right. Okay?\nPrime Minister Renzi. I think about Mosul, the considerations of President are very clear. For Italian side, we are particularly committed about dam. There is a dam—a dangerous dam—and we support an Italian company who will work to restore the dam, because it could be a great problem for the population.\nAnd for the rest, we are totally engaged with the rest of coalition to ensure to the Iraqi people the possibility to have a future. And let me be very great [grateful; White House correction.] to the Italian Army, particularly Italian Carabinieri, who provide in this country to learning the local police. So we are not worried for the future if we will bring Mosul because we think sooner or later that we will destroy Daesh. And the reconstruction and the rebuilding will be a priority for every member of international community. Italy is engaged in the work with the United States and the other alliance.\nLast. Prego, l'ultima. Last—[inaudible].\nQ. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. In italiano e anzi in inglese.\n[The reporter asked a question in English as follows.]\nEuropean Migration Crisis/Libya/Central American Migration to the U.S./European Union\nQ. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. The Mediterranean represents a geopolitical priority for Italy, mainly because of the constant flow of migrants. And is there common strategies on this and common strategies on Libya? And can Italy act as a bridge between Europe and Africa? And how American administration can help the efforts of the Italian Government, because Europe sometimes leave alone Italy to face the challenge? Thank you.\n[Prime Minister Renzi spoke in Italian, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nPrime Minister Renzi. I'm going to answer in Italian for the first channel, TG1. Obviously, our position is always the same one. Europe has to be more convinced and look toward Africa with more conviction. And from this stance, we can't go every time to ask for help to the United States without doing our part. The United States are busy in all the international theaters. And the ones that are closer to us, we obviously need the support of our best friend, because the United States are this: our best friend.\nBut we also have to start an Italian and European strategy. We can't always just sit and wait for this type of support. Therefore, the issue of the Mediterranean and Africa has been left aside during the last 10 years in the European Union. We have to give it priority again. We have to work as the Commission had foreseen it would do. But it's not doing it with the necessary speed, and we will do whatever we can with the agreements with certain states, with the five states that are our priority. We have to work for Africa to be a priority, including a priority from the point of view of resources, local development.\nWe will talk about this during the G-7 in Sicily next year. And in terms of investments, the political investment—which perhaps in the last few years has been sorely lacking—before asking for help for—from the United States, which is something we gladly do, Italy and Europe have to do their part. Italy will increase its efforts for international cooperation in the ranking of G-7 for international cooperation. We were the last in the classification, seven—the seventh in the position, the list of seven. It's not a good position. But we will reach the fourth place in the ranking in terms of GDP, which each of us proposes.\nSo we have an increase in terms of the money in international cooperation, in funds. And in terms of Libya, you know that we are working. We want to stabilize the Government. We want to make sure that there is a block of all these brothers and sisters that leave their country. Every time they go to sea, they risk dying. We're happy and we're very proud to help save lives. But the ocean is one of the worst places to do that. But we don't want the Mediterranean to become a cemetery, so we have to have a long-term strategy. We spoke about this. And we have to have short-term strategies as well. We're very proud of what we're doing, but we know that this method cannot go on forever. We cannot think of being in charge by ourselves of all the problems of Libya and Africa. And from this stance, in the—on Thursday and Friday, at the European Council, we will talk about this.\nPresident Obama. [Inaudible]—extensive topic of conversation. Let me just make a few points. Number one, it is a strategic interest of the United States to make sure that the migration crisis that's been taking place in Europe is solved. It's a strategic interest because of the terrible loss of life that we see as people attempt to reach Europe, but also because of the distorting effects that it can have on European politics if the sense is that the influx of migration is disorderly, chaotic, and overwhelms European countries. And so we are deeply committed in Europe's success in resolving this issue effectively.\nNow, obviously, there are a lot of contributors to it. So we are very focused on strengthening the Government of National Accord, as I indicated. And Secretary John Kerry and others are working with his counterparts on a multilateral basis to strengthen the Government of National Accord, resolve tensions that exist between the different portions of Libya, and then to be able to invest and build in their capacity to control their borders and their waterways. Because if we don't have a partner on the other side of the ocean, it's going to continue to be a problem. That's point number one.\nPoint number two: We are deeply appreciative of the generosity and humanitarian impulses of the Italian people in rescuing so many people through Operation Sophia. What we did in Warsaw during the NATO meeting was to indicate that although that is primarily a EU mission, NATO and the United States and our naval assets are prepared to assist in a robust way where appropriate. And it's just a matter of coordinating with Europe to find out—and Italy and other countries—what it is that you need, we will help. The same way that we do with respect to helping to enforce the agreement between Turkey and the European Union on that portion, that body of water.\nThe third point, as Matteo pointed out, is more long term, and that is, trying to help these countries that are having difficulties, where people feel either unstable, insecure, or just hungry and in search of opportunity. How do we help them develop in such a way where people feel that they can succeed and raise their families without fleeing to more developed countries? That is a longer term proposition, but we have to begin to make the investments now.\nI mentioned to Matteo, we have obviously different issues with respect to migration. And net migration into this country has actually been flat—in some cases, even decreased—or we've seen reverse flows, particularly with respect to Mexico. But one area where we have seen a big spike over the last several years is actually from the smaller countries in Central America where the economy is doing poorly; agriculture has done poorly, in part because of changing weather patterns; violence brought on by narcotraffickers.\nSo Vice President Biden, I gave him the charge of working with those countries to come up with a development plan. Congress, on a bipartisan basis, supported us putting more money into these countries for development, more effective policing, dealing with fighting the narcotraffickers in a more effective way, investing in young people. But that's not going to happen overnight. That will be a decade-long process, potentially.\nIn the meantime, we insist that those countries cooperate with us to send a message to the populations that it is a dangerous trip to reach the United States, and if you get here, you're likely to be turned back, to try to discourage a dangerous—this dangerous passage but also to try to undermine the human traffickers who are preying on the desperation of these people to make money.\nSo all those strategies have to be employed. And the one thing I would encourage is—and I've said this whenever I've visited Europe—you can't have a situation where Italy, Greece, Germany are bearing the entire burden. If in fact you have a European Union, then you're unified not just for the benefits, but also for the costs. And I do think it is important for Europe collectively to be invested in solving this problem and not just leave it to one country, in the same way that here in the United States, obviously, it's—we're an actual nation-state as opposed to a union of separate states. But we would not abandon one State and just say, here, you deal with an entire problem and good luck with that. Right? If we have solidarity and benefit from that solidarity on a whole range of issues, then that means you also have joint responsibilities. Okay?\nQ. Sir, on Central American, numbers have actually increased——\nPresident Obama. That's what I just said. I said Central America, they've increased, David [David Nakamura, Washington Post]. Why——\nQ.

No, actually, David, they went—they spiked heavily in 2014, went down significantly in 2015, have gone back up this year, in part because there's still desperation in Central America, but are still not at the levels they were in 2014.\nBut I appreciate you shouting out a question, since I'm sure there are a lot of other colleagues of yours who would want to do the same.

Women and men of every faith, background, and race have channeled their talents and ingenuity into harnessing the spirit of innovation that has long been the hallmark of our people. And as an essential part of our country's story, minority-owned enterprises have helped spur this progress. During Minority Enterprise Development Week, we reflect on the significant ways they have helped put our economy on the path to success, and we recommit to empowering every hardworking American to write our next great chapters.\nMinority-owned firms employ millions of workers and generate more than $1 trillion in economic output, revitalizing our communities and driving our growth. That is why my Administration is helping entrepreneurs of all backgrounds and small businesses across our country get the resources they need to get off the ground. Through the Minority Business Development Agency, we have led efforts to promote growth and competitiveness. We are helping streamline the process of starting a company and investing in entrepreneurship training and skill building for more Americans. Through www.Business.USA.gov, we are helping more enterprises get information about Federal contracts, and we are connecting them to critical resources to help develop and grow a business. In today's global economy, minority-owned businesses are essential to our country's success. They are twice as likely as other businesses to export their goods and services, and I am working to encourage entrepreneurship and innovation through a smart trade agenda that will allow us to sell more goods, boost economic competitiveness, and help more of our entrepreneurs thrive.\nOur Nation has always drawn strength from the diversity of our people, and no matter who you are, what you look like, or where you come from, America is a place where everyone deserves a chance to get ahead. This week, we must continue working to support minority enterprises and all entrepreneurs—and ensure that by expanding access to the networks, capital, and opportunities required to build a business, everybody can have a fair shot at reaching their piece of the American dream.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 23 through October 29, 2016, as Minority Enterprise Development Week. I call upon all Americans to celebrate this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities to recognize the many contributions of our Nation's minority enterprises.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-10-18", "title": "Proclamation 9526—Minority Enterprise Development Week, 2016"}

In his remarks, he referred to Agnese Landini, wife, and Laura Bovoli, mother, of Prime Minister Renzi; and fashion designer Giorgio Armani. Prime Minister Renzi referred to his daughter Ester.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119524", "text": "President Obama. Good evening, everybody!\nAudience members. Good evening!\nPresident Obama. Buona sera!\nAudience members. Buona sera!\nPresident Obama. On behalf of my—Michelle and myself, welcome to the White House. And welcome to the final state dinner of my Presidency. But in the immortal words of a great Italian American, Yogi Berra, \"It ain't over till it's over.\" And so we have a wonderful evening ahead of us as we celebrate the great alliance between the United States and Italy with our great friends, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and Mrs. Agnese Landini.\nNow, I have to say, this is a remarkable crowd. I will confess that, at first, I was a little nervous about this dinner. After all, Matteo is called Il Rottamatore—The Scrapper, The Demolition Man. [Laughter] And Roberto Benigni is here as well, and he has promised not to jump on the tables. [Laughter] Ask any Italian or Italian American, and they'll tell you that the dinners can get somewhat animated. People can get excited, especially if your grandmother thinks you're not eating enough. And so Michelle and I decided to just think of this as a typical Italian Sunday dinner: surrounded by family and great friends—paisans—and pasta.\nBut tonight we're reminded that American democracy has been graced by the touch of Italy. Our declaration that \"all men are created equal\" was penned by Thomas Jefferson, and it was a concept shared by his friend, also from Florence, Firenze, Filippo Mazzei. We stand before the Lincoln Memorial and see the work of the Piccirilli brothers. We look up at the dome of the U.S. Capitol and marvel at the touch of Brumidi. Then again, some days our Presidential campaigns can seem like Dante's \"Inferno.\" [Laughter]\nMost of all, we see the spirit of Italy—and the friendships between our people—in so many proud Italian Americans. I suspect that many of you here tonight are thinking of your own families—parents, grandparents, great-grandparents—who left the old country, who toiled and sacrificed and gave everything they had so that the next generation could succeed. And your presence here tonight shows that America is a place where if you work hard, no matter what you look like, what your last name is, how many vowels you have in your name, you can make it if you try. And even if we are not Italian American, or Mets fans, we can celebrate that Mike Piazza is finally in the Baseball Hall of Fame. [Laughter]\nI also want to take this occasion to once again thank my great friend Matteo. He may be the youngest Prime Minister in modern Italian history—he makes me feel old, which is unfortunate. [Laughter] When I came in I was the young guy; now he's the young guy. [Laughter] But from the first time we met, I could see that he represented the energy and the optimism, the vision and the values that can carry Italy, and Europe, forward. He is, as you say in Italy, buono come il pane.\nMatteo, I cannot thank you enough for your excellent partnership as we've worked to advance the security and prosperity of our citizens and the dignity of people around the world. I understand that when you were growing up, your mother would tell you stories about Robert Kennedy's commitment to justice and that she would end by telling you, \"Matteo, fight.\" As you fight for the cause of reform, know that we stand with you. I believe that Italy, and the world, will continue to benefit from your leadership for many years to come.\nNow, one of the reasons that I'm so confident that Matteo will continue to make outstanding contributions is because he has an outstanding partner in Agnese. Our wives keep us humble. As our Italian friends know, Matteo's first claim to fame—when he was just 19 years old—was, he was on Italy's version of \"Wheel of Fortune.\" [Laughter] This is a true story. And Agnese points out that several of the sweaters and the suits that he wore were too big—which is an affront to Italian fashion. [Laughter] Matteo may deny it, but there's video, and you can judge for yourself. [Laughter] Giorgio Armani is here, and he would be ashamed to know that the Italian Prime Minister used to wear things like this. [Laughter]\nNow, you are not alone, because when Michelle was in Milan for last year's Expo, she spoke with some young people about the importance of eating slowly and savoring your food—unlike President Obama, who she said, sometimes \"shovels\" his food down—[laughter]—which is true. [Laughter] So the point is that Matteo and I both married up. And because of our wives, we eat better, we dress better, we are better. And we thank you both.\nIn closing, I just want to reminisce about my last visit to Rome. Thanks to Matteo's Minister—Ministry of Culture, I had the opportunity to visit the Coliseum. And one of the perks of being President is, you can go to the Coliseum and nobody else is there. It was late in the day. It was quiet. The Sun was going down. And as I walked across those ancient stones, worn by the history of 2,000 years, it was a humbling reminder of our place here on Earth.\nIn the grand sweep of time, each of us is here only for a brief moment. So many of the things that we focus on each day—the political ups and downs, the successes and the setbacks—those things are fleeting. What matters in the end is what we build. What matters is what we leave behind, the things that will endure long after we are gone. As the poet Virgil reminded us, \"Fortune favors the bold.\"\nAnd so I want to propose a toast: To the enduring alliance between the United States and Italy; to our friends, Matteo and Agnese; and to the friendship between the Americans and the Italians. In pursuit of the world we can build for future generations, may we always be bold; may fortune smile upon us. Salute. Cheers.\n[At this point, President Obama offered a toast.]\nAnd with that, let me bring to the stage the Prime Minister of Italy, Matteo Renzi.\nPrime Minister Renzi. Mr. President, Madam First Lady, dear American friends, cari amici italiani: It is an incredible honor. It's an incredible privilege to be here with you on this occasion of the last state dinner of President Obama. I am really excited and really great because I think this is a special moment for the history of this country, as the Presidency of President Obama was a special moment in the life of this great country.\nSo thank you so much. Thank you. It's an honor for Italy, dear Barack, but it's also an honor for us. So thank you all, from Agnese and myself, for your warm welcome.\nBut I'm really in a difficult situation, because it's impossible for me to reply after the President Obama, and also this afternoon I spent time to imagine an organization of something to give thanks. And it's impossible. I think, for Mr. President, that we can organize after the finish of your service a dinner in Florence, after the little walk in Uffizi's Gallery and in front of David, and we can prepare Sasha and Malia to verify if really ice cream—Italian ice cream—is better on the water, and then not a state dinner, but we with the osteria, with the Florentine wine and Tuscan wine we can taste. And we can verify if the tomatoes of the garden of White House are better than tomatoes of Italian products.[Laughter] We can try that.\nI know, Michelle, your tomatoes are great. But after the last week's, let me be very frank: Your speeches are better than your tomatoes. [Laughter] And thank you so much. Thank you so much as Prime Minister, but thank you so much also as father of a young daughter.\nAnd, Barack, you know I'm a huge fan of you. You know I follow from the first speech in—first, not first—first speech for the Presidential run in February 2007 in Illinois. But when I listened to the speech of Michelle in Philadelphia, I think finally, finally, maybe when I see—\"when they go low, we go high,\" I told you, finally, I found someone of the same level of Barack Obama: Michelle Obama. [Laughter] So this is good.\nJust—but let me conclude with a personal consideration. I come from a city called Florence, so I really—I love lots the history of my country. And during the Renaissance in Florence, masters and students used to work together to produce masterpieces and also not masterpieces, but the goal is masterpiece—masterpieces they have endured across centuries. And those workshops—this workshop was called bottega. Bottega was the place in which masters and students together tried to do better, tried to build a future. New generation acquired inside the bottega a comprehensive vision of the future. And I think, Mr. President, dear Barack, this is what you have done for us in this period.\nEight years, very important for international community, not only for the United States of America. And I think your service was a service as a master of Renaissance, because you work with us to give us an opportunity and we worked together exactly with the spirit of bottega: try to make better, try to give a special opportunity to new generations.\nSo, as a Florentine, I think I'm really grateful to you for your service and also for your message of the ideal state of government because with your message, a lot of new leaders around the world today could imagine the future as a good place in which imagine our destination and our generation.\nThank you so much for that, Mr. President. Thank you so much, master of Renaissance.\nSo, in Italy, there is an expression, is an expression who come from the shared table, a shared moment of a—particular moment in the dinner and lunch—is an expression who come from Latin: cum and panis. Cum from Latin is \"with\"; panis is \"bread.\" Cum panis comes a lot of things; the expression \"company\" comes exactly from that. Why? Because the values in the table are exactly the values of sharing not only bread, not only wine, not only food, but sharing a friendship and common values. I think this is the real relation between the United States of America and Italy. We share the same values, the same friendship. And yes, in the table, cum piú panis, we share the bread. We share the food. We share also the wine. But we share above all the future and the common values. For all the reasons, I propose a toast: To President Obama, to First Lady Michelle, thank you so much for your incredible journey. Thank you so much for your incredible service. Thank you so much for the values you inspire not only in the United States of America, but around the world. Thank you, President.\n[Prime Minister Renzi offered a toast.]\nThank you, President.

I'm Chris Wallace of Fox News, and I welcome you to the third and final of the 2016 presidential debates between Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.\nThis debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. The commission has designed the format: Six roughly 15-minute segments with two-minute answers to the first question, then open discussion for the rest of each segment. Both campaigns have agreed to those rules.\nFor the record, I decided the topics and the questions in each topic. None of those questions has been shared with the commission or the two candidates. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent. No cheers, boos, or other interruptions so we and you can focus on what the candidates have to say.\nNo noise, except right now, as we welcome the Democratic nominee for president, Secretary Clinton, and the Republican nominee for president, Mr. Trump. [applause]\nSecretary Clinton, Mr. Trump, welcome. Let's get right to it. The first topic is the Supreme Court.\nYou both talked briefly about the court in the last debate, but I want to drill down on this, because the next president will almost certainly have at least one appointment and likely or possibly two or three appointments.\nWhich means that you will, in effect, determine the balance of the court for what could be the next quarter century.\nFirst of all, where do you want to see the court take the country? And secondly, what's your view on how the Constitution should be interpreted? Do the founders' words mean what they say or is it a living document to be applied flexibly according to changing circumstances? In this segment, Secretary Clinton, you go first. You have two minutes.\nCLINTON: Thank you very much, Chris. And thanks to UNLV for hosting us.\nYou know, I think when we talk about the Supreme Court, it really raises the central issue in this election, namely, what kind of country are we going to be? What kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens? What kind of rights will Americans have?\nAnd I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy. For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women's rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system.\nI have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court. But I feel that at this point in our country's history, it is important that we not reverse marriage equality, that we not reverse Roe v. Wade, that we stand up against Citizens United, we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace, that we stand up and basically say: The Supreme Court should represent all of us.\nThat's how I see the court, and the kind of people that I would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans.\nAnd I look forward to having that opportunity. I would hope that the Senate would do its job and confirm the nominee that President Obama has sent to them. That's the way the Constitution fundamentally should operate. The president nominates, and then the Senate advises and consents, or not, but they go forward with the process.\nWALLACE: Secretary Clinton, thank you.\nMr. Trump, same question. Where do you want to see the court take the country? And how do you believe the Constitution should be interpreted?\nTRUMP: Well, first of all, it's great to be with you, and thank you, everybody. The Supreme Court: It's what it's all about. Our country is so, so—it's just so imperative that we have the right justices.\nSomething happened recently where Justice Ginsburg made some very, very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people, many, many millions of people that I represent. And she was forced to apologize. And apologize she did. But these were statements that should never, ever have been made.\nWe need a Supreme Court that in my opinion is going to uphold the Second Amendment, and all amendments, but the Second Amendment, which is under absolute siege. I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I truly don't think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now. But I feel that it's absolutely important that we uphold, because of the fact that it is under such trauma.\nI feel that the justices that I am going to appoint—and I've named 20 of them—the justices that I'm going to appoint will be pro-life. They will have a conservative bent. They will be protecting the Second Amendment. They are great scholars in all cases, and they're people of tremendous respect. They will interpret the Constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted. And I believe that's very, very important.\nI don't think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear. It's all about the Constitution of—of—and so important, the Constitution the way it was meant to be. And those are the people that I will appoint.\nWALLACE: Mr. Trump, thank you.\nWe now have about 10 minutes for an open discussion. I want to focus on two issues that, in fact, by the justices that you name could end up changing the existing law of the land. First is one that you mentioned, Mr. Trump, and that is guns.\nSecretary Clinton, you said last year, let me quote, \"The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment.\" And now, in fact, in the 2008 Heller case, the court ruled that there is a constitutional right to bear arms, but a right that is reasonably limited. Those were the words of the Judge Antonin Scalia who wrote the decision. What's wrong with that?\nCLINTON: Well, first of all, I support the Second Amendment. I lived in Arkansas for 18 wonderful years. I represented upstate New York. I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership. It goes back to the founding of our country.\nBut I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation. Because I support the Second Amendment doesn't mean that I want people who shouldn't have guns to be able to threaten you, kill you or members of your family.\nAnd so when I think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns. I think we need comprehensive background checks, need to close the online loophole, close the gun show loophole. There's other matters that I think are sensible that are the kind of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the Second Amendment.\nYou mentioned the Heller decision. And what I was saying that you referenced, Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them. And the court didn't accept that reasonable regulation, but they've accepted many others. So I see no conflict between saving people's lives and defending the Second Amendment.\nWALLACE: Let me bring Mr. Trump in here. The bipartisan Open Debate Coalition got millions of votes on questions to ask here, and this was, in fact, one of the top questions that they got. How will you ensure the Second Amendment is protected? You just heard Secretary Clinton's answer. Does she persuade you that, while you may disagree on regulation, that, in fact, she supports a Second Amendment right to bear arms?\nTRUMP: Well, the D.C. vs. Heller decision was very strongly—and she was extremely angry about it. I watched. I mean, she was very, very angry when upheld. And Justice Scalia was so involved. And it was a well-crafted decision. But Hillary was extremely upset, extremely angry. And people that believe in the Second Amendment and believe in it very strongly were very upset with what she had to say.\nWALLACE: Well, let me bring in Secretary Clinton. Were you extremely upset?\nCLINTON: Well, I was upset because, unfortunately, dozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns, because, unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions.\nBut there's no doubt that I respect the Second Amendment, that I also believe there's an individual right to bear arms. That is not in conflict with sensible, commonsense regulation.\nAnd, you know, look, I understand that Donald's been strongly supported by the NRA. The gun lobby's on his side. They're running millions of dollars of ads against me. And I regret that, because what I would like to see is for people to come together and say: Of course we're going to protect and defend the Second Amendment. But we're going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33,000 lives that we lose every year.\nWALLACE: Let me bring Mr. Trump back into this, because, in fact, you oppose any limits on assault weapons, any limits on high- capacity magazines. You support a national right to carry law. Why, sir?\nTRUMP: Well, let me just tell you before we go any further. In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city. So we have the toughest laws, and you have tremendous gun violence.\nI am a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment. And I am—I don't know if Hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner, but I'm very proud to have the endorsement of the NRA. And it's the earliest endorsement they've ever given to anybody who ran for president. So I'm very honored by all of that.\nWe are going to appoint justices—this is the best way to help the Second Amendment. We are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the Second Amendment, that will not do damage to the Second Amendment.\nWALLACE: Well, let's pick up on another issue which divides you and the justices that whoever ends up winning this election appoints could have a dramatic effect there, and that's the issue of abortion.\nTRUMP: Right.\nWALLACE: Mr. Trump, you're pro-life. But I want to ask you specifically: Do you want the court, including the justices that you will name, to overturn Roe v. Wade, which includes—in fact, states—a woman's right to abortion?\nTRUMP: Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life, and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states.\nWALLACE: But I'm asking you specifically. Would you like to...\nTRUMP: If they overturned it, it will go back to the states.\nWALLACE: But what I'm asking you, sir, is, do you want to see the court overturn—you just said you want to see the court protect the Second Amendment. Do you want to see the court overturn Roe v. Wade?\nTRUMP: Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justice on, that's really what's going to be—that will happen. And that'll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court. I will say this: It will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination.\nWALLACE: Secretary Clinton?\nCLINTON: Well, I strongly support Roe v. Wade, which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate, most difficult, in many cases, decisions about her health care that one can imagine. And in this case, it's not only about Roe v. Wade. It is about what's happening right now in America.\nSo many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding Planned Parenthood, which, of course, provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country.\nDonald has said he's in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood. He even supported shutting the government down to defund Planned Parenthood. I will defend Planned Parenthood. I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women's rights to make their own health care decisions.\nWALLACE: Secretary Clinton...\nCLINTON: And we have come too far to have that turned back now. And, indeed, he said women should be punished, that there should be some form of punishment for women who obtain abortions. And I could just not be more opposed to that kind of thinking.\nWALLACE: I'm going to give you a chance to respond, but I want to ask you, Secretary Clinton, I want to explore how far you believe the right to abortion goes. You have been quoted as saying that the fetus has no constitutional rights. You also voted against a ban on late-term, partial-birth abortions. Why?\nCLINTON: Because Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account. And when I voted as a senator, I did not think that that was the case.\nThe kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make. I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy. I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions. So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account.\nWALLACE: Mr. Trump, your reaction? And particularly on this issue of late-term, partial-birth abortions.\nTRUMP: Well, I think it's terrible. If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.\nNow, you can say that that's OK and Hillary can say that that's OK. But it's not OK with me, because based on what she's saying, and based on where she's going, and where she's been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day. And that's not acceptable.\nCLINTON: Well, that is not what happens in these cases. And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate. You should meet with some of the women that I have met with, women I have known over the course of my life. This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make. And I do not believe the government should be making it.\nYou know, I've had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country. I've been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions, like they used to do in China, or forced women to bear children, like they used to do in Romania. And I can tell you: The government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice. And I will stand up for that right.\nWALLACE: All right. But just briefly, I want to move on to another segment...\nTRUMP: And, honestly, nobody has business doing what I just said, doing that, as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth. Nobody has that.\nWALLACE: All right. Let's move on to the subject of immigration. And there is almost no issue that separates the two of you more than the issue of immigration. Actually, there are a lot of issues that separate the two of you.\nMr. Trump, you want to build a wall. Secretary Clinton, you have offered no specific plan for how you want to secure our southern border. Mr. Trump, you are calling for major deportations. Secretary Clinton, you say that within your first 100 days as president you're going to offer a package that includes a pathway to citizenship. The question, really, is, why are you right and your opponent wrong?\nMr. Trump, you go first in this segment. You have two minutes.\nTRUMP: Well, first of all, she wants to give amnesty, which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting on line for many, many years. We need strong borders.\nIn the audience tonight, we have four mothers of—I mean, these are unbelievable people that I've gotten to know over a period of years whose children have been killed, brutally killed by people that came into the country illegally. You have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country. They're coming in illegally. Drugs are pouring in through the border. We have no country if we have no border.\nHillary wants to give amnesty. She wants to have open borders. The border—as you know, the Border Patrol agents, 16,500-plus ICE last week, endorsed me. First time they've ever endorsed a candidate. It means their job is tougher. But they know what's going on. They know it better than anybody. They want strong borders. They feel we have to have strong borders.\nI was up in New Hampshire the other day. The biggest complaint they have—it's with all of the problems going on in the world, many of the problems caused by Hillary Clinton and by Barack Obama. All of the problems—the single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern border. It's just pouring and destroying their youth. It's poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people. We have to have strong borders. We have to keep the drugs out of our country. We are—right now, we're getting the drugs, they're getting the cash. We need strong borders. We need absolute—we cannot give amnesty.\nNow, I want to build the wall. We need the wall. And the Border Patrol, ICE, they all want the wall. We stop the drugs. We shore up the border. One of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords, all of the bad ones—we have some bad, bad people in this country that have to go out. We're going to get them out; we're going to secure the border. And once the border is secured, at a later date, we'll make a determination as to the rest. But we have some bad hombres here, and we're going to get them out.\nWALLACE: Mr. Trump, thank you. Same question to you, Secretary Clinton. Basically, why are you right and Mr. Trump is wrong?\nCLINTON: Well, as he was talking, I was thinking about a young girl I met here in Las Vegas, Carla, who is very worried that her parents might be deported, because she was born in this country but they were not. They work hard, they do everything they can to give her a good life.\nAnd you're right. I don't want to rip families apart. I don't want to be sending parents away from children. I don't want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country.\nWe have 11 million undocumented people. They have 4 million American citizen children, 15 million people. He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation. Now, here's what that means. It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business, rounding up people who are undocumented. And we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country.\nI think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation. I think it's an idea that would rip our country apart.\nI have been for border security for years. I voted for border security in the United States Senate. And my comprehensive immigration reform plan of course includes border security. But I want to put our resources where I think they're most needed: Getting rid of any violent person. Anybody who should be deported, we should deport them.\nWhen it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president. Didn't even raise it. He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said we're not paying for that wall.\nSo I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly. And that's why I'm introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first 100 days with the path to citizenship.\nWALLACE: Thank you, Secretary Clinton. I want to follow up...\nTRUMP: Chris, I think it's...\nWALLACE: OK.\nTRUMP: I think I should respond to that. First of all, I had a very good meeting with the president of Mexico. Very nice man. We will be doing very much better with Mexico on trade deals. Believe me. The NAFTA deal signed by her husband is one of the worst deals ever made of any kind, signed by anybody. It's a disaster.\nHillary Clinton wanted the wall. Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts. Now, she never gets anything done, so naturally the wall wasn't built. But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.\nWALLACE: Well, let me—wait, wait, sir, let me...\nTRUMP: We are a country of laws. We either have—and by the way...\nWALLACE: Now, wait. I'd like to hear from...\nTRUMP: Well—well, but she said one thing.\nWALLACE: I'd like to hear—I'd like to hear from Secretary Clinton.\nCLINTON: I voted for border security, and there are...\nTRUMP: And the wall.\nCLINTON: There are some limited places where that was appropriate. There also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that.\nBut it is clear, when you look at what Donald has been proposing, he started his campaign bashing immigrants, calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers, that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants.\nNow, what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy will be good, because then employers can't exploit them and undercut Americans' wages.\nAnd Donald knows a lot about this. He used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower. He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: \"You complain, I'll get you deported.\"\nI want to get everybody out of the shadows, get the economy working, and not let employers like Donald exploit undocumented workers, which hurts them, but also hurts American workers.\nWALLACE: Mr. Trump?\nTRUMP: President Obama has moved millions of people out. Nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it. But under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country. They've been deported. She doesn't want to say that, but that's what's happened, and that's what happened big league.\nAs far as moving these people out and moving—we either have a country or we don't. We're a country of laws. We either have a border or we don't.\nNow, you can come back in and you can become a citizen. But it's very unfair. We have millions of people that did it the right way. They're on line. They're waiting. We're going to speed up the process, big league, because it's very inefficient. But they're on line and they're waiting to become citizens.\nVery unfair that somebody runs across the border, becomes a citizen, under her plan, you have open borders. You would have a disaster on trade, and you will have a disaster with your open borders.\nWALLACE: I want to...\nTRUMP: But what she doesn't say is that President Obama has deported millions and millions of people just the way it is.\nWALLACE: Secretary Clinton, I want to...\nCLINTON: We will not have open borders. That is...\nWALLACE: Well, let me—Secretary...\nCLINTON: That is a rank mischaracterization.\nWALLACE: Secretary Clinton...\nCLINTON: We will have secure borders, but we'll also have reform. And this used to be a bipartisan issue. Ronald Reagan was the last president...\nWALLACE: Secretary Clinton, excuse me. Secretary Clinton.\nCLINTON: ... to sign immigration reform, and George W. Bush supported it, as well.\nWALLACE: Secretary Clinton, I want to clear up your position on this issue, because in a speech you gave to a Brazilian bank, for which you were paid $225,000, we've learned from the WikiLeaks, that you said this, and I want to quote. \"My dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders.\" So that's the question...\nTRUMP: Thank you.\nWALLACE: That's the question. Please quiet, everybody. Is that your dream, open borders?\nCLINTON: Well, if you went on to read the rest of the sentence, I was talking about energy. You know, we trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the world combined. And I do want us to have an electric grid, an energy system that crosses borders. I think that would be a great benefit to us.\nBut you are very clearly quoting from WikiLeaks. And what's really important about WikiLeaks is that the Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans. They have hacked American websites, American accounts of private people, of institutions. Then they have given that information to WikiLeaks for the purpose of putting it on the Internet.\nThis has come from the highest levels of the Russian government, clearly, from Putin himself, in an effort, as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed, to influence our election.\nSo I actually think the most important question of this evening, Chris, is, finally, will Donald Trump admit and condemn that the Russians are doing this and make it clear that he will not have the help of Putin in in this election, that he rejects Russian espionage against Americans, which he actually encouraged in the past? Those are the questions we need answered. We've never had anything like this happen in any of our elections before.\nWALLACE: Well?\nTRUMP: That was a great pivot off the fact that she wants open borders, OK? How did we get on to Putin?\nWALLACE: Hold on—hold on, wait. Hold on, folks. Because we—this is going to end up getting out of control. Let's try to keep it quiet so—for the candidates and for the American people.\nTRUMP: So just to finish on the borders...\nWALLACE: Yes?\nTRUMP: She wants open borders. People are going to pour into our country. People are going to come in from Syria. She wants 550 percent more people than Barack Obama, and he has thousands and thousands of people. They have no idea where they come from.\nAnd you see, we are going to stop radical Islamic terrorism in this country. She won't even mention the words, and neither will President Obama. So I just want to tell you, she wants open borders.\nNow we can talk about Putin. I don't know Putin. He said nice things about me. If we got along well, that would be good. If Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good.\nHe has no respect for her. He has no respect for our president. And I'll tell you what: We're in very serious trouble, because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads—1,800, by the way—where they expanded and we didn't, 1,800 nuclear warheads. And she's playing chicken. Look, Putin...\nWALLACE: Wait, but...\nTRUMP: ... from everything I see, has no respect for this person.\nCLINTON: Well, that's because he'd rather have a puppet as president of the United States.\nTRUMP: No puppet. No puppet.\nCLINTON: And it's pretty clear...\nTRUMP: You're the puppet!\nCLINTON: It's pretty clear you won't admit...\nTRUMP: No, you're the puppet.\nCLINTON: ... that the Russians have engaged in cyberattacks against the United States of America, that you encouraged espionage against our people, that you are willing to spout the Putin line, sign up for his wish list, break up NATO, do whatever he wants to do, and that you continue to get help from him, because he has a very clear favorite in this race.\nSo I think that this is such an unprecedented situation. We've never had a foreign government trying to interfere in our election. We have 17—17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin and they are designed to influence our election. I find that deeply disturbing.\nWALLACE: Secretary Clinton...\nCLINTON: And I think it's time you take a stand...\nTRUMP: She has no idea whether it's Russia, China, or anybody else.\nCLINTON: I am not quoting myself.\nTRUMP: She has no idea.\nCLINTON: I am quoting 17...\nTRUMP: Hillary, you have no idea.\nCLINTON: ... 17 intelligence—do you doubt 17 military and civilian...\nTRUMP: And our country has no idea.\nCLINTON: ... agencies.\nTRUMP: Yeah, I doubt it. I doubt it.\nCLINTON: Well, he'd rather believe Vladimir Putin than the military and civilian intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect us. I find that just absolutely...[crosstalk]\nTRUMP: She doesn't like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way.\nWALLACE: Mr. Trump...\nTRUMP: Excuse me. Putin has outsmarted her in Syria.\nWALLACE: Mr. Trump...[crosstalk]\nTRUMP: He's outsmarted her every step of the way.\nWALLACE: I do get to ask some questions.\nTRUMP: Yes, that's fine.\nWALLACE: And I would like to ask you this direct question. The top national security officials of this country do believe that Russia has been behind these hacks. Even if you don't know for sure whether they are, do you condemn any interference by Russia in the American election?\nTRUMP: By Russia or anybody else.\nWALLACE: You condemn their interference?\nTRUMP: Of course I condemn. Of course I—I don't know Putin. I have no idea.\nWALLACE: I'm not asking—I'm asking do you condemn?\nTRUMP: I never met Putin. This is not my best friend. But if the United States got along with Russia, wouldn't be so bad.\nLet me tell you, Putin has outsmarted her and Obama at every single step of the way. Whether it's Syria, you name it. Missiles. Take a look at the \"start up\" that they signed. The Russians have said, according to many, many reports, I can't believe they allowed us to do this. They create warheads, and we can't. The Russians can't believe it. She has been outsmarted by Putin.\nAnd all you have to do is look at the Middle East. They've taken over. We've spent $6 trillion. They've taken over the Middle East. She has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody I've ever seen in any government whatsoever.\nWALLACE: We're a long way away from immigration, but I'm going to let you finish this topic. You got about 45 seconds.\nTRUMP: And she always will be.\nCLINTON: I—I find it ironic that he's raising nuclear weapons. This is a person who has been very cavalier, even casual about the use of nuclear weapons. He's...\nTRUMP: Wrong.\nCLINTON: ... advocated more countries getting them, Japan, Korea, even Saudi Arabia. He said, well, if we have them, why don't we use them, which I think is terrifying.\nBut here's the deal. The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed. There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so. And that's why 10 people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out and, in an unprecedented way, said they would not trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes or to have his finger on the nuclear button.\nTRUMP: I have 200 generals...\nWALLACE: Very quickly.\nTRUMP: ... and admirals, 21 endorsing me, 21 congressional Medal of Honor recipients. As far as Japan and other countries, we are being ripped off by everybody in the—we're defending other countries. We are spending a fortune doing it. They have the bargain of the century.\nAll I said is, we have to renegotiate these agreements, because our country cannot afford to defend Saudi Arabia, Japan, Germany, South Korea, and many other places. We cannot continue to afford—she took that as saying nuclear weapons.\nWALLACE: OK.\nTRUMP: Look, she's been proven to be a liar on so many different ways. This is just another lie.\nCLINTON: Well, I'm just quoting you when you were asked...\nTRUMP: There's no quote. You're not going to find a quote from me.\nCLINTON: ... about a potential nuclear—nuclear competition in Asia, you said, you know, go ahead, enjoy yourselves, folks. That kind...\nTRUMP: And defend yourselves.\nCLINTON: ... of language—well...\nTRUMP: And defend yourselves. I didn't say nuclear. And defend yourself.\nCLINTON: The United States has kept the peace—the United States has kept the peace through our alliances. Donald wants to tear up our alliances. I think it makes the world safer and, frankly, it makes the United States safer. I would work with our allies in Asia, in Europe, in the Middle East, and elsewhere. That's the only way we're going to be able to keep the peace.\nWALLACE: We're going to—no, we are going to move on to the next topic, which is the economy. And I hope we handle that as well as we did immigration. You also have very different ideas about how to get the economy growing faster. Secretary Clinton, in your plan, government plays a big role. You see more government spending, more entitlements, more tax credits, more tax penalties. Mr. Trump, you want to get government out with lower taxes and less regulation.\nTRUMP: Yes.\nWALLACE: We're going to drill down into this a little bit more. But in this overview, please explain to me why you believe that your plan will create more jobs and growth for this country and your opponent's plan will not. In this round, you go first, Secretary Clinton.\nCLINTON: Well, I think when the middle class thrives, America thrives. And so my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle-class families many more opportunities. I want us to have the biggest jobs program since World War II, jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing. I think we can compete with high-wage countries, and I believe we should. New jobs and clean energy, not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem, but to create new opportunities and new businesses.\nI want us to do more to help small business. That's where two- thirds of the new jobs are going to come from. I want us to raise the national minimum wage, because people who live in poverty should not—who work full-time should not still be in poverty. And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do.\nI feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college. That's why I want more technical education in high schools and in community colleges, real apprenticeships to prepare young people for the jobs of the future. I want to make college debt-free and for families making less than $125,000, you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or university if the plan that I worked on with Bernie Sanders is enacted.\nAnd we're going to work hard to make sure that it is, because we are going to go where the money is. Most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top. So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share. We're going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country.\nThat is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs. By contrast, Donald's plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose 3.5 million jobs. Why? Because his whole plan is to cut taxes, to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations, adding $20 trillion to our debt, and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before, because it truly will be trickle-down economics on steroids.\nSo the plan I have I think will actually produce greater opportunities. The plan he has will cost us jobs and possibly lead to another Great Recession.\nWALLACE: Secretary, thank you. Mr. Trump, why will your plan create more jobs and growth than Secretary Clinton's?\nTRUMP: Well, first of all, before I start on my plan, her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes. Her tax plan is a disaster. And she can say all she wants about college tuition. And I'm a big proponent. We're going to do a lot of things for college tuition. But the rest of the public's going to be paying for it. We will have a massive, massive tax increase under Hillary Clinton's plan.\nBut I'd like to start off where we left, because when I said Japan and Germany, and I'm—not to single them out, but South Korea, these are very rich, powerful countries. Saudi Arabia, nothing but money. We protect Saudi Arabia. Why aren't they paying?\nShe immediately—when she heard this, I questioned it, and I questioned NATO. Why aren't the NATO questioned—why aren't they paying? Because they weren't paying.\nSince I did this—this was a year ago—all of a sudden, they're paying. And I've been given a lot—a lot of credit for it. All of a sudden, they're starting to pay up. They have to pay up. We're protecting people, they have to pay up. And I'm a big fan of NATO. But they have to pay up.\nShe comes out and said, we love our allies, we think our allies are great. Well, it's awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are.\nWe have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us out. We have, during his regime, during President Obama's regime, we've doubled our national debt. We're up to $20 trillion.\nSo my plan—we're going to renegotiate trade deals. We're going to have a lot of free trade. We're going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now. But we have horrible deals. Our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed, NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever. Our jobs are being sucked out of our economy.\nYou look at all of the places that I just left, you go to Pennsylvania, you go to Ohio, you go to Florida, you go to any of them. You go upstate New York. Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places. We're bringing our jobs back.\nI am going to renegotiate NAFTA. And if I can't make a great deal—then we're going to terminate NAFTA and we're going to create new deals. We're going to have trade, but we're going—we're going to terminate it, we're going to make a great trade deal.\nAnd if we can't, we're going to do it—we're going to go a separate way, because it has been a disaster. We are going to cut taxes massively. We're going to cut business taxes massively. They're going to start hiring people. We're going to bring the $2.5 trillion...\nWALLACE: Time, Mr. Trump.\nTRUMP: ... that's offshore back into the country. We are going to start the engine rolling again, because...\nWALLACE: Mr. Trump?\nTRUMP: ... right now, our country is dying at 1 percent GDP.\nCLINTON: Well, let me translate that, if I can, Chris, because...\nTRUMP: You can't.\nCLINTON: ... the fact is, he's going to advocate for the largest tax cuts we've ever seen, three times more than the tax cuts under the Bush administration. I have said repeatedly throughout this campaign: I will not raise taxes on anyone making $250,000 or less.\nI also will not add a penny to the debt. I have costed out what I'm going to do. He will, through his massive tax cuts, add $20 trillion to the debt.\nWell, he mentioned the debt. We know how to get control of the debt. When my husband was president, we went from a $300 billion deficit to a $200 billion surplus and we were actually on the path to eliminating the national debt. When President Obama came into office, he inherited the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression. He has cut the deficit by two-thirds.\nSo, yes, one of the ways you go after the debt, one of the ways you create jobs is by investing in people. So I do have investments, investments in new jobs, investments in education, skill training, and the opportunities for people to get ahead and stay ahead. That's the kind of approach that will work.\nWALLACE: Secretary...\nCLINTON: Cutting taxes on the wealthy, we've tried that. It has not worked the way that it has been promised.\nWALLACE: Secretary Clinton, I want to pursue your plan, because in many ways it is similar to the Obama stimulus plan in 2009, which has led to the slowest GDP growth since 1949.\nTRUMP: Correct.\nWALLACE: Thank you, sir.\nYou told me in July when we spoke that the problem is that President Obama didn't get to do enough in what he was trying to do with his stimulus. So is your plan basically more—even more of the Obama stimulus?\nCLINTON: Well, it's a combination, Chris. And let me say that when you inherit the level of economic catastrophe that President Obama inherited, it was a real touch-and-go situation. I was in the Senate before I became secretary of state. I've never seen people as physically distraught as the Bush administration team was because of what was happening to the economy.\nI personally believe that the steps that President Obama took saved the economy. He doesn't get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions. But it was a terrible recession.\nSo now we've dug ourselves out of it, we're standing, but we're not yet running. So what I am proposing is that we invest from the middle out and the ground up, not the top down. That is not going to work.\nThat's why what I have put forward doesn't add a penny to the debt, but it is the kind of approach that will enable more people to take those new jobs, higher-paying jobs. We're beginning to see some increase in incomes, and we certainly have had a long string of increasing jobs. We've got to do more to get the whole economy moving, and that's what I believe I will be able to do.\nWALLACE: Mr. Trump, even conservative economists who have looked at your plan say that the numbers don't add up, that your idea, and you've talked about 25 million jobs created, 4 percent...\nTRUMP: Over a 10-year period.\nWALLACE: ... growth is unrealistic. And they say—you talk a lot about growing the energy industry. They say with oil prices as low as they are right now, that's unrealistic, as well. Your response, sir?\nTRUMP: So I just left some high representatives of India. They're growing at 8 percent. China is growing at 7 percent. And that for them is a catastrophically low number.\nWe are growing—our last report came out—and it's right around the 1 percent level. And I think it's going down. Last week, as you know, the end of last week, they came out with an anemic jobs report. A terrible jobs report. In fact I said, is that the last jobs report before the election? Because if it is, I should win easily, it was so bad. The report was so bad.\nLook, our country is stagnant. We've lost our jobs. We've lost our businesses. We're not making things anymore, relatively speaking. Our product is pouring in from China, pouring in from Vietnam, pouring in from all over the world.\nI've visited so many communities. This has been such an incredible education for me, Chris. I've gotten to know so many—I've developed so many friends over the last year. And they cry when they see what's happened. I pass factories that were thriving 20, 25 years ago, and because of the bill that her husband signed and she blessed 100 percent, it is just horrible what's happened to these people in these communities.\nNow, she can say that her husband did well, but, boy, did they suffer as NAFTA kicked in, because it didn't really kick in very much, but it kicked in after they left. Boy, did they suffer. That was one of the worst things that's ever been signed by our country.\nNow she wants to sign Trans-Pacific Partnership. And she wants it. She lied when she said she didn't call it the gold standard in one of the debates. She totally lied. She did call it the gold standard. And they actually fact checked, and they said I was right. I was so honored.\nWALLACE: I want you to give you a chance to briefly speak to that, and then I want to pivot to one-sixth of the economy...\nTRUMP: And that will be as bad as NAFTA.\nWALLACE: ... which is Obamacare. But go ahead, briefly.\nCLINTON: Well, first, let me say, number one, when I saw the final agreement for TPP, I said I was against it. It didn't meet my test. I've had the same test. Does it create jobs, raise incomes, and further our national security? I'm against it now. I'll be against it after the election. I'll be against it when I'm president.\nThere's only one of us on this stage who's actually shipped jobs to Mexico, because that's Donald. He's shipped jobs to 12 countries, including Mexico.\nBut he mentioned China. And, you know, one of the biggest problems we have with China is the illegal dumping of steel and aluminum into our markets. I have fought against that as a senator. I've stood up against it as secretary of state.\nDonald has bought Chinese steel and aluminum. In fact, the Trump Hotel right here in Las Vegas was made with Chinese steel. So he goes around with crocodile tears about how terrible it is, but he has given jobs to Chinese steelworkers, not American steelworkers.\nWALLACE: Mr. Trump?\nCLINTON: That's the kind of approach that is just not going to work.\nTRUMP: Well, let me just say—let me just say.\nCLINTON: We're going to pull the country together. We're going to have trade agreements that we enforce. That's why I'm going to have a trade prosecutor for the first time in history. And we're going to enforce those agreements, and we're going to look for businesses to help us by buying American products.\nWALLACE: Secretary Clinton? Go ahead, Mr. Trump.\nTRUMP: Let me ask a simple question. She's been doing this for 30 years. Why the hell didn't you do it over the last 15, 20 years?\nCLINTON: No, I voted.\nTRUMP: You were very much involved—excuse me. My turn. You were very much involved in every aspect of this country. Very much. And you do have experience. I say the one thing you have over me is experience, but it's bad experience, because what you've done has turned out badly.\nFor 30 years, you've been in a position to help, and if you say that I use steel or I use something else, I—make it impossible for me to do that. I wouldn't mind.\nThe problem is, you talk, but you don't get anything done, Hillary. You don't. Just like when you ran the State Department, $6 billion was missing. How do you miss $6 billion? You ran the State Department, $6 billion was either stolen. They don't know. It's gone, $6 billion. If you become president, this country is going to be in some mess. Believe me.\nCLINTON: Well, first of all, what he just said about the State Department is not only untrue, it's been debunked numerous times.\nBut I think it's really an important issue. He raised the 30 years of experience, so let me just talk briefly about that. You know, back in the 1970s, I worked for the Children's Defense Fund. And I was taking on discrimination against African-American kids in schools. He was getting sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination in his apartment buildings.\nIn the 1980s, I was working to reform the schools in Arkansas. He was borrowing $14 million from his father to start his businesses. In the 1990s, I went to Beijing and I said women's rights are human rights. He insulted a former Miss Universe, Alicia Machado, called her an eating machine.\nTRUMP: Give me a break.\nCLINTON: And on the day when I was in the Situation Room, monitoring the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice, he was hosting the \"Celebrity Apprentice.\" So I'm happy to compare my 30 years of experience, what I've done for this country, trying to help in every way I could, especially kids and families get ahead and stay ahead, with your 30 years, and I'll let the American people make that decision.\nTRUMP: Well, I think I did a much better job. I built a massive company, a great company, some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, worth many, many billions of dollars. I started with a $1 million loan. I agree with that. It's a $1 million loan. But I built a phenomenal company.\nAnd if we could run our country the way I've run my company, we would have a country that you would be so proud of. You would even be proud of it.\nAnd frankly, when you look at her real record, take a look at Syria. Take a look at the migration. Take a look at Libya. Take a look at Iraq. She gave us ISIS, because her and Obama created this huge vacuum, and a small group came out of that huge vacuum because when—we should never have been in Iraq, but once we were there, we should have never got out the way they wanted to get out. She gave us ISIS as sure as you are sitting there. And what happened is now ISIS is in 32 countries. And now I listen how she's going to get rid of ISIS. She's going to get rid of nobody.\nWALLACE: All right. We are going to get to foreign hot spots in a few moments, but the next segment is fitness to be president of the United States. Mr. Trump, at the last debate, you said your talk about grabbing women was just that, talk, and that you'd never actually done it. And since then, as we all know, nine women have come forward and have said that you either groped them or kissed them without their consent.\nWhy would so many different women from so many different circumstances over so many different years, why would they all in this last couple of weeks make up—you deny this—why would they all make up these stories?\nSince this is a question for both of you, Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump says what your husband did and that you defended was even worse. Mr. Trump, you go first.\nTRUMP: Well, first of all, those stories have been largely debunked. Those people—I don't know those people. I have a feeling how they came. I believe it was her campaign that did it.\nJust like if you look at what came out today on the clips where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence? She's the one and Obama that caused the violence. They hired people—they paid them $1,500, and they're on tape saying be violent, cause fights, do bad things.\nI would say the only way—because those stories are all totally false, I have to say that. And I didn't even apologize to my wife, who's sitting right here, because I didn't do anything. I didn't know any of these—I didn't see these women.\nThese women—the woman on the plane, the—I think they want either fame or her campaign did it. And I think it's her campaign. Because what I saw what they did, which is a criminal act, by the way, where they're telling people to go out and start fist-fights and start violence.\nAnd I'll tell you what, in particular in Chicago, people were hurt and people could have been killed in that riot. And that was now all on tape, started by her. I believe, Chris, that she got these people to step forward. If it wasn't, they get their 10 minutes of fame. But they were all totally—it was all fiction. It was lies, and it was fiction.\nCLINTON: Well...\nWALLACE: Secretary Clinton?\nCLINTON: At the last debate, we heard Donald talking about what he did to women. And after that, a number of women have come forward saying that's exactly what he did to them. Now, what was his response? Well, he held a number of big rallies where he said that he could not possibly have done those things to those women because they were not attractive enough for them to be assaulted.\nTRUMP: I did not say that. I did not say that.\nCLINTON: In fact, he went on to say...\nWALLACE: Her two minutes—sir, her two minutes. Her two minutes.\nTRUMP: I did not say that.\nWALLACE: It's her two minutes.\nCLINTON: He went on to say, \"Look at her. I don't think so.\" About another woman, he said, \"That wouldn't be my first choice.\" He attacked the woman reporter writing the story, called her \"disgusting,\" as he has called a number of women during this campaign.\nDonald thinks belittling women makes him bigger. He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don't think there is a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like. So we now know what Donald thinks and what he says and how he acts toward women. That's who Donald is.\nI think it's really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is, and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next president, how we want to bring our country together, where we don't want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other, where instead we celebrate our diversity, we lift people up, and we make our country even greater.\nAmerica is great, because America is good. And it really is up to all of us to make that true, now and in the future, and particularly for our children and our grandchildren.\nWALLACE: Mr. Trump...\nTRUMP: Nobody has more respect for women than I do. Nobody. [laughter]\nNobody has more respect...\nWALLACE: Please, everybody.\nTRUMP: And frankly, those stories have been largely debunked. And I really want to just talk about something slightly different.\nShe mentions this, which is all fiction, all fictionalized, probably or possibly started by her and her very sleazy campaign. But I will tell you what isn't fictionalized are her e-mails, where she destroyed 33,000 e-mails criminally, criminally, after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.\nWhat happened to the FBI, I don't know. We have a great general, four-star general, today you read it in all of the papers, going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the FBI. One lie. She's lied hundreds of times to the people, to Congress, and to the FBI. He's going to probably go to jail. This is a four-star general. And she gets away with it, and she can run for the presidency of the United States? That's really what you should be talking about, not fiction, where somebody wants fame or where they come out of her crooked campaign.\nWALLACE: Secretary Clinton?\nCLINTON: Well, every time Donald is pushed on something which is obviously uncomfortable, like what these women are saying, he immediately goes to denying responsibility. And it's not just about women. He never apologizes or says he's sorry for anything.\nSo we know what he has said and what he's done to women. But he also went after a disabled reporter, mocked and mimicked him on national television.\nTRUMP: Wrong.\nCLINTON: He went after Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the parents of a young man who died serving our country, a Gold Star family, because of their religion. He went after John McCain, a prisoner of war, said he prefers \"people who aren't captured.\" He went after a federal judge, born in Indiana, but who Donald said couldn't be trusted to try the fraud and racketeering case against Trump University because his parents were Mexican.\nSo it's not one thing. This is a pattern, a pattern of divisiveness, of a very dark and in many ways dangerous vision of our country, where he incites violence, where he applauds people who are pushing and pulling and punching at his rallies. That is not who America is.\nAnd I hope that as we move in the last weeks of this campaign, more and more people will understand what's at stake in this election. It really does come down to what kind of country we are going to have.\nTRUMP: So sad when she talks about violence at my rallies, and she caused the violence. It's on tape.\nWALLACE: During the last...\nTRUMP: The other things are false, but honestly, I'd love to talk about getting rid of ISIS, and I'd love to talk about other things...\nWALLACE: OK.\nTRUMP: ... but those other charges, as she knows, are false.\nWALLACE: In this bucket about fitness to be president, there's been a lot of developments over the last 10 days since the last debate. I'd like to ask you about them. These are questions that the American people have.\nSecretary Clinton, during your 2009 Senate confirmation hearing, you promised to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest with your dealing with the Clinton Foundation while you were secretary of state, but e-mails show that donors got special access to you. Those seeking grants for Haiti relief were considered separately from non-donors, and some of those donors got contracts, government contracts, taxpayer money.\nCan you really say that you kept your pledge to that Senate committee? And why isn't what happened and what went on between you and the Clinton Foundation, why isn't it what Mr. Trump calls pay to play?\nCLINTON: Well, everything I did as secretary of state was in furtherance of our country's interests and our values. The State Department has said that. I think that's been proven.\nBut I am happy, in fact I'm thrilled to talk about the Clinton Foundation, because it is a world-renowned charity and I am so proud of the work that it does. You know, I could talk for the rest of the debate—I know I don't have the time to do that.\nBut just briefly, the Clinton Foundation made it possible for 11 million people around the world with HIV-AIDS to afford treatment, and that's about half all the people in the world who are getting treatment. In partnership with the American Health Association...\nWALLACE: Secretary Clinton...\nCLINTON: ... we have made environments in schools healthier for kids, including healthier lunches...\nWALLACE: Secretary Clinton, respectfully, this is—this is an open discussion.\nCLINTON: Well, it is an open discussion. And you...\nWALLACE: And the specific question went to pay for play. Do you want to talk about that?\nCLINTON: Well, but there is no—but there is no evidence—but there is...[crosstalk]\nTRUMP: I think that it's been very well...\nWALLACE: Let's ask Mr. Trump.\nCLINTON: There is a lot of evidence about the very good work...\nTRUMP: It's been very well studied.\nCLINTON: ... and the high rankings...[crosstalk]\nWALLACE: Please let  Mr. Trump speak.\nTRUMP: ... and it's a criminal enterprise, and so many people know it.\nWALLACE: Please let Mr. Trump speak.\n[crosstalk]\nTRUMP: It's a criminal enterprise. Saudi Arabia giving $25 million, Qatar, all of these countries. You talk about women and women's rights? So these are people that push gays off business—off buildings. These are people that kill women and treat women horribly. And yet you take their money.\nSo I'd like to ask you right now, why don't you give back the money that you've taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly? Why don't you give back the money? I think it would be a great gesture.\nBecause she takes a tremendous amount of money. And you take a look at the people of Haiti. I was at a little Haiti the other day in Florida. And I want to tell you, they hate the Clintons, because what's happened in Haiti with the Clinton Foundation is a disgrace. And you know it, and they know it, and everybody knows it.\nWALLACE: Secretary Clinton?\nCLINTON: Well, very quickly, we at the Clinton Foundation spend 90 percent—90 percent of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs of people around the world and in our own country. I'm very proud of that. We have the highest rating from the watchdogs that follow foundations. And I'd be happy to compare what we do with the Trump Foundation, which took money from other people and bought a six- foot portrait of Donald. I mean, who does that? It just was astonishing.\nBut when it comes to Haiti, Haiti is the poorest country in our hemisphere. The earthquake and the hurricanes, it has devastated Haiti. Bill and I have been involved in trying to help Haiti for many years. The Clinton Foundation raised $30 million to help Haiti after the catastrophic earthquake and all of the terrible problems the people there had.\nWe have done things to help small businesses, agriculture, and so much else. And we're going to keep working to help Haiti...\nWALLACE: All right.\nCLINTON: ... because it's an important part of the American experience.\nTRUMP: They don't want you to help them anymore.\n[crosstalk]\nTRUMP: I'd like to mention one thing. Trump Foundation, small foundation. People contribute, I contribute. The money goes 100 percent—100 percent goes to different charities, including a lot of military. I don't get anything. I don't buy boats. I don't buy planes. What happens—the money goes to them.\nWALLACE: Wasn't some of the money used to settle your lawsuits, sir?\nTRUMP: No, it was—we put up the American flag. And that's it. They put up the American flag. We fought for the right in Palm Beach to put up the American flag.\nWALLACE: Right. But there was a penalty that was imposed by Palm Beach County, and the money came from your foundation...\nTRUMP: There was. There was. And, by the way...\nWALLACE: ... instead of Mar-a-Lago or yourself, sir.\nTRUMP: ... the money—the money went to Fisher House, where they build houses—the money that you're talking about went to Fisher House, where they build houses for veterans and disabled vets.\nWALLACE: I want to get into one...\nCLINTON: But, of course, there's no way we can know whether any of that is true, because he hasn't released his tax returns. He is the first candidate ever to run for president in the last 40-plus years who has not released his tax returns, so everything he says about charity or anything else, we can't prove it. You can look at our tax returns. We've got them all out there.\nBut what is really troubling is that we learned in the last debate he has not paid a penny in federal income tax. And we were talking about immigrants a few minutes ago, Chris. You know, half of all immigrants—undocumented immigrants in our country—actually pay federal income tax. So we have undocumented immigrants in America who are paying more federal income tax than a billionaire. I find that just astonishing.\nWALLACE: I want...\nTRUMP: So let me just tell you very quickly, we're entitled because of the laws that people like her passed to take massive amounts of depreciation on other charges, and we do it. And all of her donors—just about all of them—I know Buffett took hundreds of millions of dollars, Soros, George Soros, took hundreds of millions of dollars...\nWALLACE: We...\nTRUMP: Let me just explain.\nWALLACE: But, no, we heard this...\nTRUMP: Most of her donors have done the same thing as I do.\nWALLACE: Mr. Trump, we—OK.\nTRUMP: You know what she should have done?\nWALLACE: Folks, we heard this...\nTRUMP: And you know, Hillary, what you should have done, you should have changed the law when you were a United States senator...\nWALLACE: Folks, we heard this...\nTRUMP: ... because your donors and your special interests are doing the same thing as I do, except even more so.\nCLINTON: Well, you know...\nTRUMP: You should have changed the law. But you won't change the law, because you take in so much money. I mean, I sat in my apartment today on a very beautiful hotel down the street known as Trump...\nCLINTON: Made with Chinese steel.\nTRUMP: But I will tell you, I sat there...[laughter]... I sat there watching ad after ad after ad, false ad. All paid for by your friends on Wall Street that gave so much money because they know you're going to protect them. And, frankly, you should have changed the laws.\nWALLACE: Mr. Trump...\nTRUMP: If you don't like what I did, you should have changed the laws.\nWALLACE: Mr. Trump, I want to ask you about one last question in this topic. You have been warning at rallies recently that this election is rigged and that Hillary Clinton is in the process of trying to steal it from you.\nYour running mate, Governor Pence, pledged on Sunday that he and you—his words—\"will absolutely accept the result of this election.\" Today your daughter, Ivanka, said the same thing. I want to ask you here on the stage tonight: Do you make the same commitment that you will absolutely—sir, that you will absolutely accept the result of this election?\nTRUMP: I will look at it at the time. I'm not looking at anything now. I'll look at it at the time.\nWhat I've seen—what I've seen is so bad. First of all, the media is so dishonest and so corrupt, and the pile-on is so amazing. The New York Times actually wrote an article about it, but they don't even care. It's so dishonest. And they've poisoned the mind of the voters.\nBut unfortunately for them, I think the voters are seeing through it. I think they're going to see through it. We'll find out on November 8th. But I think they're going to see through it.\nWALLACE: But, sir, there's...\nTRUMP: If you look—excuse me, Chris—if you look at your voter rolls, you will see millions of people that are registered to vote—millions, this isn't coming from me—this is coming from Pew Report and other places—millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn't be registered to vote.\nSo let me just give you one other thing. So I talk about the corrupt media. I talk about the millions of people—tell you one other thing. She shouldn't be allowed to run. It's crooked—she's—she's guilty of a very, very serious crime. She should not be allowed to run.\nAnd just in that respect, I say it's rigged, because she should never...\nWALLACE: But...\nTRUMP: Chris, she should never have been allowed to run for the presidency based on what she did with e-mails and so many other things.\nWALLACE: But, sir, there is a tradition in this country—in fact, one of the prides of this country—is the peaceful transition of power and that no matter how hard-fought a campaign is, that at the end of the campaign that the loser concedes to the winner. Not saying that you're necessarily going to be the loser or the winner, but that the loser concedes to the winner and that the country comes together in part for the good of the country. Are you saying you're not prepared now to commit to that principle?\nTRUMP: What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time. I'll keep you in suspense. OK?\nCLINTON: Well, Chris, let me respond to that, because that's horrifying. You know, every time Donald thinks things are not going in his direction, he claims whatever it is, is rigged against him.\nThe FBI conducted a year-long investigation into my e-mails. They concluded there was no case; he said the FBI was rigged. He lost the Iowa caucus. He lost the Wisconsin primary. He said the Republican primary was rigged against him. Then Trump University gets sued for fraud and racketeering; he claims the court system and the federal judge is rigged against him. There was even a time when he didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged against him.\nTRUMP: Should have gotten it. [laughter]\nCLINTON: This is—this is a mindset. This is how Donald thinks. And it's funny, but it's also really troubling.\nWALLACE: OK.\nCLINTON: So that is not the way our democracy works. We've been around for 240 years. We've had free and fair elections. We've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them. And that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a debate stage during a general election. You know, President Obama said the other day when you're whining before the game is even finished... [applause]\nWALLACE: Hold on. Hold on, folks. Hold on, folks.\nCLINTON: ... it just shows you're not up to doing the job. And let's—you know, let's be clear about what he is saying and what that means. He is denigrating—he's talking down our democracy. And I, for one, am appalled that somebody who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind of position.\nTRUMP: I think what the FBI did and what the Department of Justice did, including meeting with her husband, the attorney general, in the back of an airplane on the tarmac in Arizona, I think it's disgraceful. I think it's a disgrace.\nWALLACE: All right.\nTRUMP: I think we've never had a situation so bad in this country. [applause]\nWALLACE: Hold on, folks. This doesn't do any good for anyone. Let's please continue the debate, and let's move on to the subject of foreign hot spots.\nThe Iraqi offensive to take back Mosul has begun. If they are successful in pushing ISIS out of that city and out of all of Iraq, the question then becomes, what happens the day after? And that's something that whichever of you ends up—whoever of you ends up as president is going to have to confront.\nWill you put U.S. troops into that vacuum to make sure that ISIS doesn't come back or isn't replaced by something even worse? Secretary Clinton, you go first in this segment. You have two minutes.\nCLINTON: Well, I am encouraged that there is an effort led by the Iraqi army, supported by Kurdish forces, and also given the help and advice from the number of special forces and other Americans on the ground. But I will not support putting American soldiers into Iraq as an occupying force. I don't think that is in our interest, and I don't think that would be smart to do. In fact, Chris, I think that would be a big red flag waving for ISIS to reconstitute itself.\nThe goal here is to take back Mosul. It's going to be a hard fight. I've got no illusions about that. And then continue to press into Syria to begin to take back and move on Raqqa, which is the ISIS headquarters.\nI am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a real—a really successful military operation. But we know we've got lots of work to do. Syria will remain a hotbed of terrorism as long as the civil war, aided and abetted by the Iranians and the Russians, continue.\nSo I have said, look, we need to keep our eye on ISIS. That's why I want to have an intelligence surge that protects us here at home, why we have to go after them from the air, on the ground, online, why we have to make sure here at home we don't let terrorists buy weapons. If you're too dangerous to fly, you're too dangerous to buy a gun.\nAnd I'm going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to, frankly, gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track.\nWALLACE: Mr. Trump, same question. If we are able to push ISIS out of Mosul and out of Iraq, will—would you be willing to put U.S. troops in there to prevent their return or something else?\nTRUMP: Let me tell you, Mosul is so sad. We had Mosul. But when she left, when she took everybody out, we lost Mosul. Now we're fighting again to get Mosul. The problem with Mosul and what they wanted to do is they wanted to get the leaders of ISIS who they felt were in Mosul.\nAbout three months ago, I started reading that they want to get the leaders and they're going to attack Mosul. Whatever happened to the element of surprise, OK? We announce we're going after Mosul. I have been reading about going after Mosul now for about—how long is it, Hillary, three months? These people have all left. They've all left.\nThe element of surprise. Douglas MacArthur, George Patton spinning in their graves when they see the stupidity of our country. So we're now fighting for Mosul, that we had. All she had to do was stay there, and now we're going in to get it.\nBut you know who the big winner in Mosul is going to be after we eventually get it? And the only reason they did it is because she's running for the office of president and they want to look tough. They want to look good. He violated the red line in the sand, and he made so many mistakes, made all the mistakes. That's why we have the great migration. But she wanted to look good for the election. So they're going in.\nBut who's going to get Mosul, really? We'll take Mosul eventually. But the way—if you look at what's happening, much tougher than they thought. Much, much tougher. Much more dangerous. Going to be more deaths that they thought.\nBut the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because they're smart. They say, what do we need this for? So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing. And Iran should write us a letter of thank you, just like the really stupid—the stupidest deal of all time, a deal that's going to give Iran absolutely nuclear weapons. Iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much, because Iran, as I said many years ago, Iran is taking over Iraq, something they've wanted to do forever, but we've made it so easy for them.\nSo we're now going to take Mosul. And do you know who's going to be the beneficiary? Iran. Oh, yeah, they're making—I mean, they are outsmarting—look, you're not there, you might be involved in that decision. But you were there when you took everybody out of Mosul and out of Iraq. You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but you did vote for it. You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but once you were in Iraq, you should have never left the way.\nWALLACE: Sir, your two minutes are up.\nTRUMP: The point is, the big winner is going to be Iran.\nCLINTON: Well, you know, once again, Donald is implying that he didn't support the invasion of Iraq. I said it was a mistake. I've said that years ago. He has consistently denied what is...\nTRUMP: Wrong.\nCLINTON: ... a very clear fact that...\nTRUMP: Wrong.\nCLINTON: ... before the invasion, he supported it. And, you know, I just want everybody to go Google it. Google \"Donald Trump Iraq.\" And you will see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of Iraq.\nTRUMP: Wrong.\nCLINTON: And you can actually hear the audio of him saying that. Now, why does that matter? Well, it matters because he has not told the truth about that position. I guess he believes it makes him look better now to contrast with me because I did vote for it.\nBut what's really important here is to understand all the interplay. Mosul is a Sunni city. Mosul is on the border of Syria. And, yes, we do need to go after Baghdadi, and—just like we went after bin Laden, while you were doing \"Celebrity Apprentice,\" and we brought him to justice. We need to go after the leadership.\nBut we need to get rid of them, get rid of their fighters. There are an estimated several thousand fighters in Mosul. They've been digging underground. They've been prepared to defend. It's going to be tough fighting. But I think we can take back Mosul, and then we can move on into Syria and take back Raqqa.\nThis is what we have to do. I'm just amazed that he seems to think that the Iraqi government and our allies and everybody else launched the attack on Mosul to help me in this election, but that's how Donald thinks. You know, he always is looking for some conspiracy.\nTRUMP: Chris, we don't gain anything.\nCLINTON: He has all the conspiracy theories...[crosstalk]\nTRUMP: Iran is taking over Iraq.\nWALLACE: Secretary Clinton, it's...[crosstalk]\nTRUMP: Iran is taking over Iraq. We don't gain anything.\nCLINTON: This conspiracy theory, which he's been spewing out for quite some time.\nTRUMP: If they did it by surprise...[crosstalk]\nWALLACE: Wait, wait, wait, Secretary Clinton, it's an open discussion.\nCLINTON: He says...[crosstalk]\nTRUMP: We could have gained if they did it by surprise.\nWALLACE: Secretary, please let Mr. Trump speak.\nCLINTON: ... unfit, and he proves it every time he talks.\nTRUMP: No, you are the one that's unfit. You know, WikiLeaks just actually came out—John Podesta said some horrible things about you, and, boy, was he right. He said some beauties. And you know, Bernie Sanders, he said you have bad judgment. You do.\nAnd if you think that going into Mosul after we let the world know we're going in, and all of the people that we really wanted—the leaders—they're all gone. If you think that was good, then you do. Now, John Podesta said you have terrible instincts. Bernie Sanders said you have bad judgment. I agree with both.\nCLINTON: Well, you should ask Bernie Sanders who he's supporting for president. And he has said...\nTRUMP: Which is a big mistake.\nCLINTON: ... as he has campaigned for me around the country, you are the most dangerous person to run for president in the modern history of America. I think he's right.\nWALLACE: Let's turn to Aleppo. Mr. Trump, in the last debate, you were both asked about the situation in the Syrian city of Aleppo. And I want to follow up on that, because you said several things in that debate which were not true, sir. You said that Aleppo has basically fallen. In fact, there—in fact, there are...\nTRUMP: It's a catastrophe. I mean...\nWALLACE: It's a catastrophe, but there...\nTRUMP: ... it's a mess.\nWALLACE: There are a quarter of...\nTRUMP: Have you seen it? Have you seen it?\nWALLACE: Sir...\nTRUMP: Have you seen what's happening to Aleppo?\nWALLACE: Sir, if I may finish my question...\nTRUMP: OK, so it hasn't fallen. Take a look at it.\nWALLACE: Well, there are a quarter of a million people still living there and being slaughtered.\nTRUMP: That's right. And they are being slaughtered...\nWALLACE: Yes.\nTRUMP: ... because of bad decisions.\nWALLACE: If I may just finish here, and you also said that—that Syria and Russia are busy fighting ISIS. In fact, they have been the ones who've been bombing and shelling eastern Aleppo, and they just announced a humanitarian pause, in effect, admitting that they have been bombing and shelling Aleppo. Would you like to clear that up, sir?\nTRUMP: Well, Aleppo is a disaster. It's a humanitarian nightmare. But it has fallen from the—from any standpoint. I mean, what do you need, a signed document? Take a look at Aleppo. It is so sad when you see what's happened.\nAnd a lot of this is because of Hillary Clinton, because what's happened is, by fighting Assad, who turned out to be a lot tougher than she thought, and now she's going to say, oh, he loves Assad, she's—he's just much tougher and much smarter than her and Obama. And everyone thought he was gone two years ago, three years ago. He—he aligned with Russia.\nHe now also aligned with Iran, who we made very powerful. We gave them $150 billion back. We give them $1.7 billion in cash. I mean, cash. Bundles of cash as big as this stage. We gave them $1.7 billion.\nNow they have—he has aligned with Russia and with Iran. They don't want ISIS, but they have other things, because we're backing—we're backing rebels. We don't know who the rebels are. We're giving them lots of money, lots of everything. We don't know who the rebels are. And when and if—and it's not going to happen, because you have Russia and you have Iran now. But if they ever did overthrow Assad, you might end up with—as bad as Assad is, and he's a bad guy, but you may very well end up with worse than Assad.\nIf she did nothing, we'd be in much better shape. And this is what's caused the great migration, where she's taking in tens of thousands of Syrian refugees, who probably in many cases—not probably, who are definitely...\nWALLACE: Let me...\nTRUMP: ... in many cases, ISIS-aligned, and we now have them in our country, and wait until you see—this is going to be the great Trojan horse. And wait until you see what happens in the coming years. Lots of luck, Hillary. Thanks a lot for doing a great job.\nWALLACE: Secretary Clinton, you have talked about—and in the last debate and again today—that you would impose a no-fly zone to try to protect the people of Aleppo and to stop the killing there. President Obama has refused to do that because he fears it's going to draw us closer or deeper into the conflict.\nAnd General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, says you impose a no-fly zone, chances are you're going to get into a war—his words—with Syria and Russia. So the question I have is, if you impose a no-fly zone—first of all, how do you respond to their concerns? Secondly, if you impose a no-fly zone and a Russian plane violates that, does President Clinton shoot that plane down?\nCLINTON: Well, Chris, first of all, I think a no-fly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict. I'm well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general.\nThis would not be done just on the first day. This would take a lot of negotiation. And it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground.\nWe've had millions of people leave Syria and those millions of people inside Syria who have been dislocated. So I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria, it would help us with our fight against ISIS.\nBut I want to respond to what Donald said about refugees. He's made these claims repeatedly. I am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted, who we do not have confidence in. But I am not going to slam the door on women and children. That picture of that little 4-year-old boy in Aleppo, with the blood coming down his face while he sat in an ambulance, is haunting. And so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting. That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization, to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks. In fact, the killer of the dozens of people at the nightclub in Orlando, the Pulse nightclub, was born in Queens, the same place Donald was born. So let's be clear about what the threat is and how we are best going to be able to meet it.\nAnd, yes, some of that threat emanates from over in Syria and Iraq, and we've got to keep fighting, and I will defeat ISIS, and some of it is we have to up our game and be much smarter here at home.\nWALLACE: Folks, I want to get into our final segment.\nTRUMP: But I just have to...\nWALLACE: Real quick.\nTRUMP: It's so ridiculous what she—she will defeat ISIS. We should have never let ISIS happen in the first place. And right now, they're in 32 countries.\nWALLACE: OK.\nTRUMP: We should have—wait one second. They had a cease-fire three weeks ago. A cease-fire, the United States, Russia, and Syria. And during the cease-fire, Russia took over vast swatches of land, and then they said we don't want the cease-fire anymore.\nWe are so outplayed on missiles, on cease-fires. They are outplayed. Now, she wasn't there. I assume she had nothing to do with it. But our country is so outplayed by Putin and Assad, and by the way—and by Iran. Nobody can believe how stupid our leadership is.\nWALLACE: Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton—no, we need to move on to our final segment, and that is the national debt, which has not been discussed until tonight.\nOur national debt, as a share of the economy, our GDP, is now 77 percent. That's the highest since just after World War II. But the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says, Secretary Clinton, under your plan, debt would rise to 86 percent of GDP over the next 10 years. Mr. Trump, under your plan, they say it would rise to 105 percent of GDP over the next 10 years. The question is, why are both of you ignoring this problem? Mr. Trump, you go first.\nTRUMP: Well, I say they're wrong, because I'm going to create tremendous jobs. And we're bringing GDP from, really, 1 percent, which is what it is now, and if she got in, it will be less than zero. But we're bringing it from 1 percent up to 4 percent. And I actually think we can go higher than 4 percent. I think you can go to 5 percent or 6 percent. And if we do, you don't have to bother asking your question, because we have a tremendous machine. We will have created a tremendous economic machine once again. To do that, we're taking back jobs. We're not going to let our companies be raided by other countries where we lose all our jobs, we don't make our product anymore. It's very sad. But I'm going to create a—the kind of a country that we were from the standpoint of industry. We used to be there. We've given it up. We've become very, very sloppy.\nWe've had people that are political hacks making the biggest deals in the world, bigger than companies. You take these big companies, these trade deals are far bigger than these companies, and yet we don't use our great leaders, many of whom back me and many of whom back Hillary, I must say. But we don't use those people. Those are the people—these are the greatest negotiators in the world. We have the greatest businesspeople in the world. We have to use them to negotiate our trade deals.\nWe use political hacks. We use people that get the position because they gave—they made a campaign contribution and they're dealing with China and people that are very much smarter than they are. So we have to use our great people.\nBut that being said, we will create an economic machine the likes of which we haven't seen in many decades. And people, Chris, will again go back to work and they'll make a lot of money. And we'll have companies that will grow and expand and start from new.\nWALLACE: Secretary Clinton?\nCLINTON: Well, first, when I hear Donald talk like that and know that his slogan is \"Make America Great Again,\" I wonder when he thought America was great. And before he rushes and says, \"You know, before you and President Obama were there,\" I think it's important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades.\nYou know, back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times, during the time when President Reagan was president, and basically said exactly what he just said now, that we were the laughingstock of the world. He was criticizing President Reagan. This is the way Donald thinks about himself, puts himself into, you know, the middle and says, \"You know, I alone can fix it,\" as he said on the convention stage.\nBut if you look at the debt, which is the issue you asked about, Chris, I pay for everything I'm proposing. I do not add a penny to the national debt. I take that very seriously, because I do think it's one of the issues we've got to come to grips with.\nSo when I talk about how we're going to pay for education, how we're going to invest in infrastructure, how we're going to get the cost of prescription drugs down, and a lot of the other issues that people talk to me about all the time, I've made it very clear we are going where the money is. We are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share.\nAnd there is no evidence whatsoever that that will slow down or diminish our growth. In fact, I think just the opposite. We'll have what economists call middle-out growth. We've got to get back to rebuilding the middle class, the families of America. That's where growth will come from. That's why I want to invest in you. I want to invest in your family.\nAnd I think that's the smartest way to grow the economy, to make the economy fairer. And we just have a big disagreement about this. It may be because of our experiences. You know, he started off with his dad as a millionaire...\nTRUMP: Yeah, yeah, we've heard—we've heard this before, Hillary.\nCLINTON: I started off with—my dad was a small-business man.\nTRUMP: We've heard this before.\nCLINTON: And I think it—you know, it's a difference that affects how we see the world and what we want to do with the economy.\nWALLACE: Time.\nTRUMP: Thank you, Hillary. Could I just respond?\nWALLACE: Well, no, sir, because we're running out of time...\nTRUMP: Because I did disagree with Ronald Reagan very strongly on trade. I disagreed with him. We should have been much tougher on trade even then. I've been waiting for years. Nobody does it right.\nWALLACE: OK.\nTRUMP: And frankly, now we're going to do it right.\nWALLACE: All right. The one last area I want to get into with you in this debate is the fact that the biggest driver of our debt is entitlements, which is 60 percent of all federal spending. Now, the Committee for federal—a Responsible Federal Budget has looked at both of your plans and they say neither of you has a serious plan that is going to solve the fact that Medicare's going to run out of money in the 2020s, Social Security is going to run out of money in the 2030s, and at that time, recipients are going to take huge cuts in their benefits.\nSo, in effect, the final question I want to ask you in this regard is—and let me start with you, Mr. Trump, would President Trump make a deal to save Medicare and Social Security that included both tax increases and benefit cuts, in effect, a grand bargain on entitlements?\nTRUMP: I'm cutting taxes. We're going to grow the economy. It's going to grow at a record rate of growth.\nWALLACE: That's not going to help in the entitlements.\nTRUMP: No, it's going to totally help you. And one thing we have to do: Repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. It's destroying our country. It's destroying our businesses, our small business and our big businesses. We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.\nYou take a look at the kind of numbers that that will cost us in the year '17, it is a disaster. If we don't repeal and replace—now, it's probably going to die of its own weight. But Obamacare has to go. It's—the premiums are going up 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent. Next year they're going to go up over 100 percent.\nAnd I'm really glad that the premiums have started—at least the people see what's happening, because she wants to keep Obamacare and she wants to make it even worse, and it can't get any worse. Bad health care at the most expensive price. We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.\nWALLACE: And, Secretary Clinton, same question, because at this point, Social Security and Medicare are going to run out, the trust funds are going to run out of money. Will you as president entertain—will you consider a grand bargain, a deal that includes both tax increases and benefit cuts to try to save both programs?\nCLINTON: Well, Chris, I am on record as saying that we need to put more money into the Social Security Trust Fund. That's part of my commitment to raise taxes on the wealthy. My Social Security payroll contribution will go up, as will Donald's, assuming he can't figure out how to get out of it. But what we want to do is to replenish the Social Security Trust Fund...\nTRUMP: Such a nasty woman.\nCLINTON: ... by making sure that we have sufficient resources, and that will come from either raising the cap and/or finding other ways to get more money into it. I will not cut benefits. I want to enhance benefits for low-income workers and for women who have been disadvantaged by the current Social Security system.\nBut what Donald is proposing with these massive tax cuts will result in a $20 trillion additional national debt. That will have dire consequences for Social Security and Medicare.\nAnd I'll say something about the Affordable Care Act, which he wants to repeal. The Affordable Care Act extended the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund. So if repeals it, our Medicare problem gets worse. What we need to do is go after...\nTRUMP: Your husband disagrees with you.\nCLINTON: ... the long-term health care drivers. We've got to get costs down, increase value, emphasize wellness. I have a plan for doing that. And I think that we will be able to get entitlement spending under control by with more resources and harder decisions.\nWALLACE: This is—this is the final time, probably to both of your delight, that you're going to be on a stage together in this campaign. I would like to end it on a positive note. You had not agreed to closing statements, but it seems to me in a funny way that might make it more interesting because you haven't prepared closing statements.\nSo I'd like you each to take—and we're going to put a clock up, a minute, as the final question in the final debate, to tell the American people why they should elect you to be the next president. This is another new mini-segment. Secretary Clinton, it's your turn to go first.\nCLINTON: Well, I would like to say to everyone watching tonight that I'm reaching out to all Americans—Democrats, Republicans, and independents—because we need everybody to help make our country what it should be, to grow the economy, to make it fairer, to make it work for everyone. We need your talents, your skills, your commitments, your energy, your ambition.\nYou know, I've been privileged to see the presidency up close. And I know the awesome responsibility of protecting our country and the incredible opportunity of working to try to make life better for all of you. I have made the cause of children and families really my life's work.\nThat's what my mission will be in the presidency. I will stand up for families against powerful interests, against corporations. I will do everything that I can to make sure that you have good jobs, with rising incomes, that your kids have good educations from preschool through college. I hope you will give me a chance to serve as your president.\nWALLACE: Secretary Clinton, thank you.\nMr. Trump?\nTRUMP: She's raising the money from the people she wants to control. Doesn't work that way.\nBut when I started this campaign, I started it very strongly. It's called \"Make America Great Again.\" We're going to make America great. We have a depleted military. It has to be helped, has to be fixed. We have the greatest people on Earth in our military. We don't take care of our veterans. We take care of illegal immigrants, people that come into the country illegally, better than we take care of our vets. That can't happen.\nOur policemen and women are disrespected. We need law and order, but we need justice, too. Our inner cities are a disaster. You get shot walking to the store. They have no education. They have no jobs. I will do more for African-Americans and Latinos than she can ever do in 10 lifetimes.\nAll she's done is talk to the African-Americans and to the Latinos, but they get the vote, and then they come back, they say, we'll see you in four years. We are going to make America strong again, and we are going to make America great again, and it has to start now. We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her.\nWALLACE: Thank you both. [applause]\nSecretary Clinton—hold on just a moment, folks. Secretary Clinton, Mr. Trump, I want to thank you both for participating in all three of these debates.\nThat brings to an end this year's debates sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. We want to thank the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and its students for having us. Now the decision is up to you.\nWhile millions have already voted, Election Day, November 8th, is just 20 days away. One thing everyone here can agree on: We hope you will go vote. It is one of the honors and obligations of living in this great country. Thank you, and good night.", "timestamp": "2016-10-19", "title": "Presidential Debate at the University of Nevada in Las Vegas"}

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119566", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n**Please see below for corrections, marked with asterisks.\n12:50 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Nice to hear you all in a good mood.\nQ: You're not wearing your tux. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, I've changed back into my civilian clothes, which is a coat and tie -- occupational hazard, I think. I do not have anything at the top, so we can go straight to your questions.\nKevin, do you want to start?\nQ: Sure. Josh, in keeping with the President's trip to Miami tomorrow, regarding the Affordable Care Act, is the President alarmed about the premium increases that many people are seeing, as well as insurers -- major insurers exiting the program in some markets? And is it a sign that some changes are needed?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, the President has been clear that the Affordable Care Act has had enormous benefits for Americans all across the country. Since the Affordable Care Act went into effect, we have seen the overall growth in health care costs held down. We have seen 20 million Americans get access to health care; these are Americans who didn't previously have access to health insurance before the Affordable Care Act. And we have seen millions of Americans all across the country benefit from the kinds of consumer protections that they have long been denied. These are consumer protections that protect people from having to declare bankruptcy because they essentially exceed the lifetime limit that is imposed by their health insurance company. Those lifetime limits are no longer allowed. Individuals cannot be discriminated against because they have a preexisting condition.\nSo these kinds of consumer benefits have not just helped those Americans who are shopping for health insurance on the individual market; those are consumer protections that also benefit the 150 million Americans that get their health insurance through their employer. So those kinds of improvements are obvious benefits of the Affordable Care Act and obviously all critical reasons why the President fought so hard to have this law go into effect.\nNow, I think you're acknowledging something that the President has discussed before, too, which is that there are some tweaks to the law that could be implemented that would further improve its performance. And the President has laid out some ideas for what those tweaks would look like, including further enhancing competition in the marketplace by allowing the creation of a public option that added competition in all 50 states would, we believe, have the effect of further challenging private health insurance companies to improve their offerings and reduce their prices.\nSo these are the kinds of the things that the next Congress will have to consider. Obviously, the current Congress is one that's dominated by Republicans who have voted more than 50 times to repeal the law but have not once in the last six years actually put forward their own alternative proposal.\nSo it's clear that Republicans in Congress don't share the President's interest in trying to improve our health care system in this country. Maybe the next batch of members of Congress will, and hopefully we'll have a President, like the candidate that President Obama has endorsed, who is determined to build on the remarkable success of the Affordable Care Act.\nQ: But would a public option bring insurers like United and Aetna back into the program? And what, in particular, is the administration thinking the next President, the next Congress should do to bring insurers back to the program? And isn't that a sign of a healthy Affordable Care Act if you have more insurers coming in rather than exiting?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, potentially, that is -- well, I think what we're -- I think there are two different questions. The first is, one way that you could add competition is essentially to add another entity that's committed to competing in markets all across the country. And that's exactly what the public option would do. The question is, are there other tweaks that you could make that would make it more attractive to some of the companies that you mentioned, to engage more deeply in the marketplace.\nSo the public option is not the only suggested tweak that the President would consider, but again, this is not something that he's going to be in a position to consider because we already know that this Congress is not going to act on it. But the President has in mind that there could be additional tweaks that could be made that would further enhance competition in the marketplace. And, again, this is sort of rooted in a principle that has long been championed by Republicans -- this idea of the free market driving the health insurance industry in a way that ends up being good for consumers. It has to be regulated, but regulated in a way that promotes competition, and that kind of competition can be good for consumers. And we've seen that. But there is more that we can do to further improve.\nRoberta.\nQ: Secretary Burwell said today that she expects 1.1 million more people to sign up on the exchange this year. That's out of about 10.7 million people who are uninsured who are eligible. How does the White House feel about that level of expected enrollment -- 1.1 million out of 10.7 possible?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the 1.1 million increase I believe is an increase of 8 or 9 percent over last year. So we're talking about 1.1 million additionally enrolling during the open enrollment period this year. I believe last year we ended up somewhere *between 13 and 14 million [between 12 and 13 million].\nSo that represents a continuing increase in the number of people who are enrolling for health insurance through the marketplace. And this goes to the question that Kevin raised, which is, the more people that are competing in that market, the more attractive it is to companies that are engaged in that kind of business. And the more companies that are engaged in that business who are competing for that pool of customers, the more pressure we're going to put on prices to not increase at the same rate, and we're also going to put pressure on those companies to improve their offerings.\nSo this kind of enhanced competition is an important part of what the Affordable Care Act is focused on. Prior to the Affordable Care Act going into effect, you'll recall there was no such thing as a marketplace. And individuals who weren't able to purchase health insurance through their employer -- which, I'll remind you, is the vast majority of people who currently have health insurance -- but for those who were on the individual market, were left to fend for themselves. And there was not a mechanism in place to regulate the offerings that were put forward by individual insurance companies in a way that allowed individuals to effectively compare offerings from different companies.\nSo these are the kinds of improvements on a system that was largely unregulated in a way that disadvantaged consumers. But the kinds of tweaks that we're talking about here are tweaks that would further regulate this market in a way that would enhance competition and improve the ability of individuals to go and purchase health insurance in the individual market.\nQ: By calling it a \"tweak,\" I mean, setting up a public option sounds like more than a tweak. Wouldn't that be a major legislative and administrative undertaking?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm sorry, can you repeat the question?\nQ: By calling it a \"tweak,\" doesn't it sort of underplay or downplay the amount of legislative and administrative work it would take to set up a public option to sort of address that?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't mean to downplay it. I think that this would be an important change that would improve the system. But I also wouldn't exaggerate the kind of change that this would necessitate. So many of the changes that already went into effect as a result of the Affordable Care Act were difficult to implement because of the significant changes that had brought to this individual -- to the regulation of this individual market. And adding an additional offering is a substantial change, but it doesn't reflect a complete overhaul, if you will, of the marketplace mechanism that was put in place by the Affordable Care Act.\nI'm sorry I was distracted in answering your question, because there is one other element to this debate that I think is relevant -- two other elements, actually. The first is, so much of what we're talking about when we're talking about competition and when we're talking about prices, there has understandably been an intense focus on the increase in cost in the individual market. These are individuals who have to purchase their health insurance during this open enrollment period at Healthcare.gov, in marketplaces.\nThe vast majority of Americans -- again, 150 million Americans -- get their health insurance through their employer. And five out of the last six years we have seen that the growth in premium increases is the lowest that it's been on record. So we've seen about 3 percent increases in premiums among people who get their health insurance through their employer. That represents tangible progress in limiting the growth in health care costs in a way that benefits both employers and employees.\nThat is one often-overlooked benefit of the Affordable Care Act. And again, I think there should be, and the President believes there should be focus on what we see in terms of rates in the individual market. But it's important to recognize that 10 times as many people get their health insurance through their employer, and the impact that we've seen in keeping the growth in health care costs low -- the lowest on record, five out of last six years -- is a remarkable benefit of the Affordable Care Act.\nThe second thing is, when you're talking about these marketplace consumers -- individuals who do purchase their health insurance through the marketplace -- even though we are seeing cost increases all across the country, the fact of the matter is, we do expect that next year more than half the people who seek to purchase health insurance plans through the marketplace will be able to do so for $75 a month or less. And the reason for that is that even though we are seeing an increase in costs in some states, the government subsidy that goes along with those costs also increases to limit costs for insurers to make health care affordable for people.\nSo this is something I do anticipate that we're going to be talking about quite a bit during the fall. So I appreciate your interest in this. And obviously the President will be discussing this in Miami tomorrow. But we'll have an opportunity to spend some more time working through these numbers.\nQ: And just briefly, is he going to Miami to give this speech tomorrow for some thematic reason having to do with Obamacare, or is just related to the other travel that he's doing?\nMR. EARNEST: No, it's -- the thematic reason is that we are essentially within about 10 days of the open enrollment beginning.\nQ: Right. But what does Miami or Florida have to do with --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there's a large population in Miami of young people in particular that we want to make sure understand the kinds of benefits that are available to them through the Affordable Care Act. And having covered our efforts over the two previous years -- the last few years, the three previous years, of trying to raise the awareness among young adults across the country, we have sought to target those communities across the country that have a larger proportion of young people who are eligible for coverage on the marketplace but have not yet taken advantage of it.\nFlorida is also a particularly powerful illustration of the situation because we have seen Republicans in the state of Florida block Medicaid expansion. And what we have seen, and studies show -- even studies that are not conducted by the government -- indicate that those states that did not expand Medicaid, where you had Republicans who blocked the expansion of Medicaid, we did actually see health care costs for everybody else go up. And we've seen costs in the marketplace increase an additional 7 percent in those locations, in those states that didn't expand Medicaid.\nSo I recognize that there is -- look, in some ways you could actually describe this as an effort by Republicans to sabotage the Affordable Care Act, because you have Republicans in individual states essentially preventing some people from getting health insurance that's paid for by the federal government, through Medicaid, or almost entirely paid for through the federal government, through Medicaid. That's having a negative impact on the ability of other people to afford health care through the Affordable Care Act.\nSo again, it's unfortunate the degree to which Republicans have chosen to play politics with the Affordable Care Act in a way that has not just prevented millions of people across the country from being able to get access to health care through expanded Medicaid, but also driving up the costs of millions more Americans because of their political decision to block Medicaid expansion.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, sticking to politics. Can I follow up on the President's \"stop whining\" comments from yesterday, and Trump's charges about a rigged election? The other part of the question, which I don't think he answered was, is he -- is the administration concerned about post-election violence. And frankly, I'll add to that question by saying, is the administration making any kinds of contingency plans?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Mark, I think the President, as he did -- he alluded to this in his answer yesterday. The President retains significant confidence in the strength and durability of the U.S. election system. We have typically talked about that in the context of what the IC has concluded about Russia's efforts to try to undermine confidence in that system. But the President believes there's a lot of people -- there are many reasons for the American people to have confidence in the integrity of that system, even in the face of some of these Russian-led efforts.\nBut even separate from that, there has been a concerted effort by at least one candidate to talk down the U.S. system of democracy. And that's unfortunate, and that was the substance of the President's comments yesterday. I think the President is pretty confident that not many people will be persuaded by an effort to run down the U.S. system of elections. And I'll just point out that over the last three or four days, we have seen the running mate to the Republican nominee indicate that he would respect the outcome of the election. And earlier today, we saw the campaign manager for the Republican nominee indicate her confidence in the integrity of our voting system.\nSo I don't know if they need to have a staff meeting, or maybe more broadly, circulate a memo, but I think the comments of the running mate and the campaign manager I think reflect the sentiments of Americans in both parties who believe that our democracy benefits from the vigorous conduct of an election, but we also benefit from an acceptance of the result, an acceptance of the expression of the will of the American people, and a commitment by leaders in both parties to follow the will of the American people.\nAnd this was an important part of the President's answer that I do think was a little overlooked, which is, the President articulated, despite his vigorous disagreements with Mr. Trump that we have in no way sought to minimize -- the President did pledge that if the American people do make a decision to entrust Mr. Trump with the powers of the presidency, the President would fulfill the commitment that he has made to ensure the successful and smooth transition of power in our democracy.\nOur system of government and our democracy depends on people who serve in positions of power who are willing to put the interests of the American people over their own. And the President has strong feelings about the outcome of this election. But if the American people disagree, the President is prepared to honor the will of the American people. Hopefully that's not going to come about, but I think that's a reflection of the President's commitment to this issue, that he's willing to exercise his own significant authority consistent with the approach he's hoping that everybody else will take.\nQ: My question was about violence specifically. And we've -- our colleagues who are out at campaign rallies and such hear and see people talking and holding signs talking about taking action of one sort or another if there's an outcome that they don't believe is credible. Is that something that the President finds worrisome?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think anytime anyone is talking about using violence to advance a political goal in one form or another, the President is concerned about that. And the President believes that there is no place for that in our democracy. In fact, our system of government, our democracy was established to, in an ideal world, aid our ability to resolve our differences through debate and negotiation and not -- without resorting to violence.\nAnd so there have been instances where violence has broken out at particular rallies. We saw a campaign office in North Carolina, a Republican campaign office in North Carolina that was vandalized. And the President didn't get asked about it yesterday, but I'm confident his views are consistent with what I expressed here on Monday, which is to condemn that kind of vandalism, to condemn that kind of violence. And that is consistent with the President's view that it is not appropriate to resort to violence to achieve a political goal.\nQ: And is the President's concern sufficient that some sort of contingency planning is or ought to be underway?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any sort of contingency planning that's currently underway. Obviously, the President is going to rely on law enforcement organizations and the Department of Homeland Security to make recommendations to him if any recommendations are necessary. Obviously, there is a long tradition in this country of law enforcement decisions being made at the community level, and obviously we'd expect that local law enforcement organizations would take the steps that they believe are appropriate to keep the peace in their communities.\nBut I'm not aware of any specific planning that's been undertaken with regard to that potential outcome at this point. But we're also still three weeks out from Election Day, so we'll continue to monitor the situation. And if we need to engage in some contingency planning, then we'll do that.\nJordan.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. On a separate but related topic, there's a new report out today showing that anti-Semitic abuse on Twitter is on the rise, and the report linked that abuse to supporters of Donald Trump. I'm wondering, is the President aware of this phenomenon? And if so, how much responsible does he think that Trump shares for the uptick in abuse?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I saw some news coverage of the report; I didn't read the report itself. The President has expressed, again, to all of you on a number of occasions, his concern about the kind of rhetoric that has been so carelessly used in the context of this election season.\nThe President understands that the stakes in this election are high and that he would expect people to engage in a vigorous debate. But he believes that that debate should be carried out consistent with the values in this country that we cherish, and those values include not targeting or discriminating against people because of their religion.\nQ: The Obama administration has worked with Twitter on shutting down channels related to ISIS and other extremist groups. In this instance, does the administration believe that Twitter should be doing more to curb this kind of abusive language on this platform?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously the administration is deeply respectful of the authority that Twitter should exercise in controlling -- or at least protecting the freedom of people to use Twitter to express their views. I know that Twitter has faced many of their own questions about where to draw the lines -- where do you draw the line from freely expressing your view to advocating violence or inciting violence in one form or another.\nSo you know these are difficult questions, but they also relate directly to the First Amendment rights of American citizens. So I think Twitter has taken -- assumed this responsibility understanding how serious this question is. And they have frequently responded constructively to a desire on the part of the administration to make it harder for terrorist organizations to incite violence using social medial platforms like Twitter. I think the questions are a little bit different when we're talking about the tone and rhetoric that's used in the context of a political debate, but I know that these are questions that Twitter has carefully considered and has tried to confront, both because the responsibility that they have to all of their users, but also because the success of their platform is going to depend on them establishing some rules of the road that are fair.\nThey certainly don't want to preside over a platform that muzzles dissent, where you have people who are taking a platform that should be used to freely express one's views and ultimately shut down the ability of individuals to express those views. But on the other hand, I think they're going to have a hard time recruiting people to join and participate actively in the Twitter community if the Twitter community is littered with hateful, violent images and rhetoric.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, do you have any reaction from President Obama to the invitation to his half-brother to be at the debate tonight from the Trump campaign?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't spoken to him about it, but I don't anticipate that the President has spent a lot of time considering whether or not his *brother-in-law [half-brother] should attend the debate. If he does choose to attend hopefully, he'll do something more fun than just attend the debate.\nQ: Can you describe their relationship?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know much about it. My understanding is that there's not much of one.\nQ: On the schedule for tomorrow, which comes first in the planning of tomorrow's trip? Was it the Obamacare event or the political event?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Mark, you'll recall that this was actually a trip that the President had previously planned to take to Florida earlier this month, but the trip was rescheduled as a result of Hurricane Matthew that was predicted to make landfall, and we wanted to ensure that the President's trip didn't disrupt any of the activities that were underway to plan for the eventual landfall of the hurricane.\nSo in the context of that previous trip, the President was planning to deliver a speech about the Affordable Care Act in Tampa. And just for the sake of slimming down the trip and making it more efficient, he'll deliver that speech in Miami instead, but he'll also -- we've also rescheduled the political activities that the President was previously planning to lead while he was there as well.\nQ: So the Affordable Care Act event came first in the planning?\nMR. EARNEST: That's my understanding. But obviously it's complicated, because we had originally planned the trip, we pulled it down. And then -- so in the rescheduling of the trip, I guess I would say, we planned them both because both of them had been part of the original plan. So it's hard to say that one came first, because we essentially were trying to reschedule both activities -- or both sets of activities.\nQ: Were you able to check with advance about the use of a presidential seal at political events?\nMR. EARNEST: I did have a conversation about this. I haven't gotten greater clarity about what guides the decision about whether or not to use the seal. But what is clear, and what you have clearly noticed, is that there are some occasions where we use it and some occasions where we don't. I'm not -- I don't have a lot of insight into how that decision is made. But I'll see if I can get you some more information on it.\nQ: Appreciate it.\nMR. EARNEST: Ron.\nQ: Just on the half-brother issue again, does the President see this as a perhaps subtle or not-so subtle echo of the birther issue?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I don't think it is. I have to admit I really don't know exactly what the intent is of this invitation, other than probably to get you guys to ask me about it. But even then, I'm not really sure what goal that accomplishes. But you can -- I guess you can check with people who offered the invitation.\nQ: I think we have. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: And what did they say?\nQ: I don't know. I'll get back to you on that. (Laughter.) Some people described Mr. Trump's tactics as sort of a scorched earth policy or approach in recent days. Is that -- do you think that's accurate?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I know that other analysts have observed that it doesn't appear to be a vote-getting strategy either. But, look, for the strategy that they're engaged in, they're not looking for advice from me, and I think that's pretty evident from some of the strategies that they've chosen to pursue. But I'll let him run his campaign. And they've got three weeks left to try to execute whatever strategy they believe is most likely to lead to success.\nQ: Is it fair to say the President is going to be watching the debate tonight with interest?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think like most Americans, the President is interested to see what happens in this final confrontation between the two candidates. There's an opportunity for each candidate to, in some ways, deliver a closing argument. This will be the last major platform that both candidates have, and that makes for an important moment. And the President, like most Americans who are following this election -- and that's a lot of people -- is interested to see what's going to happen.\nQ: On another issue, the email issue, not the specifics of these emails, but there still is this constant release, this constant flow of hacked messages. Is that an indication that whatever the United States' proportional response to the Russians was has not had its desired effect? Or is there any connection at all between any of that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there's a lot there in that question. Let me start by saying I'm just not going to be able to sort of evaluate what sort of response may eventually be mobilized with regard to the Russians and their effort to undermine our political system in cyberspace. So I'm not able to speak with much specificity about what actions have been taken, what actions have not been taken, whether any actions have been taken. Those are just questions I can't get into.\nWhat I'll say is that many of the releases are consistent with the tactics that the intelligence community of the United States has concluded were directed by the Russian government. And these kinds of tactics are consistent with instructions that typically would require the involvement of senior-level officials in the Russian government. And we have seen Russia engage in tactics in other democracies to try to undermine confidence in democratic institutions, primarily in Europe. So these kinds of things are -- or these kinds of tactics are not necessarily new, but what's also not new is that the American people have a lot of confidence in our system of democracy, in the durability of that system.\nIf you think about our history of carrying out elections in this country, they've survived a civil war, multiple elections through two world wars, obviously a cold war, and their adversaries --\nQ: You mentioned confidence in the system. And I think that a lot of Americans don't have confidence in cyberspace that they may have had if they see these high-profile individuals being hacked, and the administration's response is essentially they're going to respond, or we have responded proportionally, and trust us, we can't talk about it. What's reassuring about that? Because I think there is a lot of concern about whether, in fact, the administration is on top of this, given the constant, still flow of emails that have apparently been hacked.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me try to help you understand our approach to this situation. One of the things that we have tried to help people understand is that, even though our world is more connected through the Internet than ever before, it's very difficult to hack the U.S. election system. Many elements of that election system are not connected to the Internet. These systems of conducting elections, even in the context of a national election, are decentralized; that you've got states and individual localities --\nQ: I'm not talking about just confidence in the electoral system. I'm talking about confidence in email and online activities, generally speaking. I mean, I think the election issue is --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm glad you clarified that, because what I'm talking about is our election system, and that is the system that we want to make sure that we are fortifying, and that is the system that people should have confidence in. With regard to cybersecurity and with regard to the willingness of Russia or other malevolent actors to try to engage in malicious activity in cyberspace, that's not new. All of your news organizations have had to deal with that.\nAnd the President has put forward his own cybersecurity strategies, including a significant budget increase that Republicans in Congress refuse to even talk about. We believe there is more that Congress should do to invest in our cybersecurity efforts that wouldn't just protect U.S. government networks, but also the cybersecurity of the country more broadly. And there are significant national security and economic consequences for our success in that endeavor, and this administration continues to believe that's a priority, and I would expect that that's something that the President will spend some more time talking about, even in his last three months in office.\nQ: What about the specific case of Ecuador and Julian Assange and his being cut off from email? Did the United States have anything to do with that at all?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, my colleagues at the State Department -- I know the suggestion on the part of some has been that somehow Secretary Kerry may have tried to strong arm his Ecuadorian counterpart to undertake this action. Secretary Kerry said that that was not true, and we saw a statement from the Ecuadorians earlier today indicate that this is a decision that they made on their own. They have a sovereign foreign policy, and they made their own conclusion to pursue this action against Mr. Assange. And that's a decision that they've undertaken based on their own conclusion about what's in their country's best interest.\nQ: They just decided -- so, again, aside from Secretary Kerry, the position is that the United States had nothing to do with that decision?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think the accusation was made about Secretary Kerry, and he said that that was not true. The State Department said that that was not true. And the Ecuadorians have said, we did this because we decided it was the right thing to do, not because anybody else told us to do it. So I think it's a pretty open and shut case here.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. If I could follow just a second. A spokesman for the Czech National Police today announced that a Russian national was arrested in Prague for cyberattacks in the U.S. Are you aware of this report? Can you tell me anything about this individual?\nMR. EARNEST: I am aware of the report. It is the subject of an ongoing law enforcement investigation, so I can't discuss any of the details. My colleagues at the Department of Justice may be able to give you some more information about this particular individual. What I would say -- I think the one thing that I can say about it is you might cite this as one example of many where the United States Department of Justice takes very seriously the responsibility that they have to protect the United States and our interests in cyberspace. And they have gone after criminal networks, and they've even gone after individuals acting on behalf of nation-states to protect our cybersecurity here in the United States.\nThat's a vigorous effort that they've undertaken, and that's I think a clear sign that the Department of Justice is playing a vibrant role alongside other national security agencies in the United States government to protect the American people and to protect our cybersecurity.\nQ: Is it a leap too far afield to suggest that this is part of the proportional reaction to the Russians hacking U.S. cyber infrastructure?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'd refer you to my colleagues at the Department of Justice about the decision that they made with regard to this particular individual. This is -- as with all law enforcement decisions and law enforcement actions, those are taken independent of any sort of political interference.\nQ: Can I just push just a little bit more here about concerns about escalation? I think there might be at least some concern on the part of the public that if there is a proportional response to this and the Russians will simply go tit for tat on this, how big of a concern is that for the United States government?\nMR. EARNEST: It's an entirely legitimate concern, and I think it exposes -- you've uncovered here one of the significant challenges that policymakers face in dealing with cyber policy. The rules of the road when it comes to cybersecurity in large part are not well established. And that makes it difficult.\nIt's hard to draw these kinds of analogies that are very imperfect, but one example might be -- there are rules that guide freedom of navigation of U.S. ships. So we've talked about how in the South China Sea, for example, the United States would -- on several occasions has undertaken freedom of navigation operations to signal -- or to send a signal about the willingness of the United States to fly, sail and operate in international waters. And that's a well-established norm that, even though it might be occasionally irritating to some other countries, it's a norm that everybody acknowledges is one that should be followed.\nAnd when there's a violation of some of those well-established norms, like what Russia has done in Ukraine, for example, that's something that the international community acknowledges is a problem and acknowledges is worthy of a internationally organized response.\nThose clear lines, those clear norms are not as well established in cyberspace. The technology is so new and our habits for interacting in that realm are not well established. That's why at the G20, the President actually has tried to lead a discussion among other world leaders about trying to establish some of these rules of the road, to try to establish some norms among the 20 largest economies of the world about what's acceptable in cyberspace and what's not, and when those norms are violated what's an appropriate response.\nThis is something that we've made some progress on. You heard Prime Minister Xi, when he was here at the White House a year or so ago, indicate a specific commitment about not using particular cyber strategies that are funded by the Chinese government to steal secrets that could then be used to advantage in an economic context a Chinese business. He acknowledged that that's something that the Chinese government would not do. And that represents -- that was an important step that might not seem like much but that actually does establish a pretty important norm, and does guide the behavior of the United States and China in cyberspace. And that's a good thing.\nThere's more work along those lines that needs to be done. And this will -- establishing these kinds of rules of the road will be an important national security priority of the next President in the same way that it has been for this President.\nQ: Let me ask you about the new actions to spur competition in the airline industry. I remember back in April the President had an executive order among the ideas -- requiring refunds for delayed baggage, for example; making the airline market fairer, more transparent; stopping the airlines from cherry-picking the data. But when we read reports like this, almost immediately and instinctively the airline industry and some of the larger players will say, this is going to lead to increased costs. What's your response to that?\nMR. EARNEST: Our response to that is that airlines should not use the requirement to treat their passengers fairly as an excuse to further jack up prices. I don't think there's anything that has -- this doesn't have anything to do with party politics. I think most Americans believe that the airlines to whom they pay significant sums of money to help them get places should treat them fairly in return.\nAnd there is an appropriate role for the United States government to play to ensure that the interests of consumers and the interests of people who are using our commercial aviation system in the United States are treated fairly by the companies who make a substantial profit by operating in this market. U.S. airlines are making good money. That's a testament to the business practice. It's a testament to the innovation that we have seen many of them pursue. So there's nobody who is, that I can think of, that isn't rooting for their success. We all want an aviation system that functions effectively, that serves the needs of the American people. Our quality of life and our economy depend on it.\nBut we also have this sense that those airlines, as they're performing that service and as they're making a substantial profit, should treat their customers fairly. And that certainly is something that the U.S. government is prepared to enforce.\nQ: Lastly, I want to ask about the Project Veritas videos that have been making the rounds of late. Does the White House have any reaction to the dismissal or the severance of two veteran Democratic operatives after the release of the latest Project Veritas videos? In particular, I want to draw your attention to Robert Creamer, a convicted felon, who visited the White House, according to reports, 342 times; also met personally with the President some 47 times, the most recent occasion being in June of this year.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I've been asked about videos that have come from this outlet in the past. And each time, I've tried to urge people to take those reports not at face value and not just with a grain of salt, but maybe even a whole package of salt. Because despite what the name might suggest, these videos have not often revealed the truth.\nQ: You have some people that were sort of shoved out or walked away based on the release of these videos.\nMR. EARNEST: And so that is true, and so that's why I'm reluctant to comment directly on the videos themselves. I think there is a principle, though, that I will give voice to, which is, I know that there was the suggestion in some of these reports that it might be a clever organizing tactic or a clever political tactic to try to incite violence at political rallies --\nQ: Bird-dogging, that sort of thing.\nMR. EARNEST: -- that is entirely inconsistent with the President's view about community organizing and waging a vigorous campaign; that we should attempt and we should have so much confidence in the power of our persuasion and in our arguments that we shouldn't have to resort to violence. And in fact, it is completely inappropriate to resort to violence to advance a political goal. And that certainly is a principle that the President strong believes in.\nQ: As far as Creamer is concerned, with all those visits here to the White House in particular, I'm wondering, is that a reflection of the ethical standards of the Obama White House -- that a guy like that who, at least according to the videos -- admittedly, these videos are in some dispute in some circles -- seems to be suggesting voter fraud, a person who is a convicted felon, who was an often frequent visitor here at the White House? It is a reflection, some would argue, of the standards of this White House that that's the type of person that's here with that sort of frequency.\nMR. EARNEST: And I think at this point, I would urge extreme caution in drawing conclusions about anybody's character based on a few hours of having looked at this video, because time and time and time again, information that was released by this organization is a lot different than initial reports would indicate.\nQ: Can I follow up on that?\nMR. EARNEST: I'll come back to you.\nGo ahead, Cheryl.\nQ: Switching to policy. Yesterday, the President said that the T-TIP negotiation had been discussed with the Italian Prime Minister.\nMR. EARNEST: That's correct.\nQ: Can you give us any update on the status of that agreement?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know in how much detail they were able to discuss it. We'll see if we can get you some more information about the nature of their discussions on this issue. But I don't have an update for you in terms of our expectations. The President has tasked his team with a rather ambitious goal, which is to attempt to complete T-TIP negotiations by the end of the year. I know that there -- speaking of the airline industry, I suspect they're being significantly subsidized by the Office of the United States Trade Representative. I know individuals who work in that office have been logging some significant miles in the air as they have traveled to Europe to work on these negotiations. And they're working hard to try to meet the ambitious goal that the President has laid out.\nBut as is the case with all of these sorts of broad, international agreements, nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed to. So it's hard to give you a good status update other than to say that that ambitious goal remains in place, and those who have been tasked by the President of the United States to try to achieve that goal are working hard to fulfill the mission that the President has given them.\nQ: To put a little bit of a finer point on it, you just said nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed to. There is one train of thought that, in an attempt to try to get closure this year or in this administration that the T-TIP -- what they've agreed to so far could be closed out, leaving maybe a few issues to be negotiated later, do you think that's a possibility?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, at this point, I don't want to provide sort of a play-by-play of the negotiating efforts. I want to give them the opportunity to consider a range of options. And they'll pursue -- Ambassador Froman and those on his staff will pursue the approach that they believe best serves the interests of the United States. And I wouldn't handicap at this point what the likely outcome would be other than to say the President has asked Ambassador Froman to pursue an ambitious goal. And I don't know, frankly, if it's one that they will be able to achieve, but they are certainly putting the time and effort in pursuit of it. And we'll just have to see.\nThe reason that I can't offer complete assurance that this is something that will be achieved is Ambassador Froman is only going to agree to something that is in the best interest of the U.S. economy. So this is not a situation where the United States is prepared to take the first deal that the Europeans put on the table; this is something that will be negotiated rigorously. And, again, the decision about whether or not to accept this deal will not be based on the President laying out an ambitious goal, but will be based on a clear-eyed assessment about whether or not it serves the interests of the American people and would stand to benefit the U.S. economy.\nLana.\nQ: The Justice Department says they'll be dispatching fewer trained poll observers because of the Supreme Court decision on the Voting Rights Act. Is the White House concerned about the effect of this in any way on this election?\nMR. EARNEST: I hadn't heard that announcement from the Department of Justice, so I guess I would refer you to them to give them the opportunity to say whether or not they expect that this will have much impact on their ability to ensure the effective conduct of the election. Overall, the President retains very high confidence in the ability of our election system to function effectively and to yield a result that reflects the will of the American people.\nThe President also has spoken at length about his disappointment that there has been an effort by Republicans in states across the country and some Republicans in Congress to make it harder for some citizens to vote, to make it harder for veterans, some elderly voters and, yes, some college students and minority voters, as well, to cast a ballot, even though they're eligible to do so. And the President believes we should be making our election system easier for people to participate in, not erect barriers that might make it harder for them to cast a ballot if they're eligible. But those frustrations aside, the President does have confidence that, whatever the outcome is on November 8th will be an accurate reflection of the U.S. electorate.\nQ: Confidence in the democratic process and the electoral system. But is the White House or the President concerned in any way about voter intimidation?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, that's always something that, on the eve of a hard-fought election, that we are aware of. Again, we want to make sure that every eligible American voter in this country has an opportunity to participate in our system, to cast a ballot, and to have it counted. And that's with regard to whatever political party they've signed up with. So the President believes that this is an important principle, and we would call on Democrats and Republicans to work together to ensure that it's upheld in communities all across the country.\nQ: Does the President think his elder half-brother is being used as a prop at tonight's debate?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I don't think the President has given a lot of consideration about the invitation that was extended by the Trump campaign, in part because, again, I'm not really sure what kind of message they're trying to send or what goal they think it may achieve, again, other than having you guys ask me about it.\nQ: It's been successful in that.\nMR. EARNEST: I guess they have. I guess they got you on that one, didn't they?\nQ: You're making a point that they're not that close. Do you know the last time that they spoke or were in touch?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know the last time they spoke.\nQ: Getting back to Russia. You're talking about the new rules for engagement in cyber warfare. There is the argument that you're not going to disclose if decisions have been made or what actions are being taken before they're being taken. It's different than saying you're not going to tell the American public after those actions have been taken. And the Vice President said as much when he was asked about this over the weekend. He said he hopes that the American public doesn't know about the counter cyber strike that the President may order. Why shouldn't the American public believe that they are entitled to knowing when their government orders a cyberattack or the aftermath of a cyberattack on coordination?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me do a couple things. The first is, with regard to the premise of your question, just to be really clear -- and when I'm talking about establishing rules of the road, I'm talking about rules of the road in cyberspace. It doesn't just relate to cyber warfare. It also relates to espionage activity. It also relates to the conduct of businesses in cyberspace. What kind of privacy policies do they have in place? What are the rules and norms that will govern their analysis of big data, for example?\nThese are all complicated questions, and they are questions -- these are questions that have a significant consequence not just for our economy but also for our national security. So it's much broader than just sort of the realm of cyber warfare.\nWith regard to cyber warfare, the President has discussed before the significant capabilities that are retained by the United States. These are capabilities that far exceed any other country's. And some of those capabilities are based on our ability to exploit information that only we know -- potential loopholes in a particular system. And that's why we're just not going to be in a position to detail those activities publicly. It would undermine our ability to do so.\nBut the other aspect of your question that I want to make sure we're really clear about is that an appropriate proportional response to Russia's conduct in cyberspace that we believe, that our intelligence community has concluded is a concerted effort to undermine confidence in our political system, is not just limited to the cyber realm. There are other tools -- through diplomacy, through the use of sanctions -- that could be used as part of our response to Russia's activities.\nAnd so it's important that as people consider, again, the appropriate policy response, that they recognize that our options aren't just limited to a tit for tat. To sort of go back to some of the examples that I've used before, the international response to Russia flagrantly violating the international norm that Ukraine sovereignty is something that should be protected, or at least respected, was not to respond with military force. Russia violated that norm of military force, but the international response has not been to mobilize a military response. I recognize there may be some who would advocate that. But the response from the international community has actually been to mobilize a diplomatic response that has left Russia further isolated. There is an effort by the international community to mobilize a response around imposing sanctions that have had a significant, negative impact on the Russian economy.\nSo there are a variety of ways to respond to the violation of certain norms. And so just as people try to understand what the administration's approach is here, I don't want people's thinking to be so constrained that the only potential response is some secret -- the deployment of a secret offensive cyber capability. The President's options are much broader than that.\nQ: Sure. But in those examples, the American public would know about it. If we had a diplomatic response, if we had economic sanctions that we were announcing against Russia, the American public would know about that. And my question is about a cyber response from the administration and the idea that the American public doesn't deserve to know about that.\nMR. EARNEST: I think it's not necessarily about \"deserve.\" In this case, we're talking about our ability to protect the American people and to protect our interests. Obviously there is oversight of these activities. There is oversight within the executive branch; there's oversight in Congress as well. Obviously there would be the appropriate congressional committees that will be a part of this discussion. So there's independent oversight of these activities.\nBut, yes, this is an element of national security, which is that we can't talk about every single thing that the United States does to ensure that the American people are protected, and the American people retain confidence in our system of government both because they understand why some of those details can't be revealed, but also because they recognize that there is a system of checks and balances that ensure that those actions are consistent with our national interest and consistent with the United States Constitution, and that our right to privacy and civil liberties are not trampled. And the President has been forceful in advocating for the kinds of reforms that are built into those kinds of protections.\nQ: Sorry to ask so many questions about this, but as you lay out, it is unchartered territory. And what you're saying just now about balance of government and congressional oversight, I just want to be clear. Are you saying that if the President were to direct --\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not going to get into hypotheticals, so I'll just --\nQ: I know, but I guess what I'm saying -- I'm just trying to understand what you just told me -- or ended with. Did you just say that Congress would be consulted and have a check on the President ordering cyber retaliation?\nMR. EARNEST: What I'm saying is that -- I'm not going to talk about a particular hypothetical. What I'm saying is that there is congressional oversight over a range of national security authorities that the President of the United States retains to protect the American people, and that is part of what gives the American people confidence that even when there are certain aspects of our national security strategy that we can't conduct -- that we can't discuss publicly, that they are conducted consistent with our nation's best interest and with our values, including the rights that are enshrined in the United States Constitution.\nMichelle.\nQ: Several times we've heard the President now talk about his confidence in the election and in democratic systems. But the word \"rigged\" has now almost become a buzzword this cycle. It's all over the Internet. Now those videos that we talked about earlier are circulating as possible proof that things will be rigged. There's talk of collusion and things like that. Do you think that that is a risk at this point? Does the President see that as a threat to things going smoothly after the election?\nMR. EARNEST: I think most people see that kind of rhetoric as a farce. The idea that the Republican governors of Florida and Georgia and Arizona and North Carolina and Indiana and Ohio and Iowa are going to collude with Democrats is far-fetched, to say the least.\nAnd the fact that most people find this unconvincing -- the evidence that I have that most people find this unconvincing is that there are senior officials in the Republican Party who find this unconvincing, including the Republican presidential nominee's running mate, who indicated that he would respect the results of the election. Another person who is unpersuaded by that argument of a potential bipartisan conspiracy is the Republican candidate's campaign manager -- to say nothing of the Republican Speaker of the House, whose spokesperson has indicated that those kinds of conspiracy theories are far-fetched.\nSo, again, as the President alluded to yesterday, these are the kinds of conspiracy theories that are rarely floated by winners. It's the people who are not feeling good about the prospects of the outcome that would start raising these kinds of questions. That's particularly true in athletic competitions --people who are trailing on the scoreboard are the people most likely to complain about the officiating.\nQ: In certain groups you really see that thought taking hold, though. I mean, a poll this month showed that about half of Donald Trump's supporters felt like rigging is a possibility and that half of them don't trust the outcome of the election. Do you have any thoughts on why you think that that is taking hold?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I don't know why that might be taking hold, particularly because there's no evidence to substantiate those claims. And the President alluded to this in his answer yesterday, as well. There have been studies to examine whether or not to follow up on anecdotal reports of widespread voter fraud, and there's never been evidence mobilized to indicate widespread voter fraud that would change the outcome of an election.\nThere certainly are colorful anecdotes from generations ago. But of studies that were conducted of the last three or four presidential elections where more than a billion votes were cast, there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud. And there are a variety of reasons for that. Our election systems are so decentralized. You've got Democrats and Republicans in different states to preside over those election systems. You've got a whole system of poll watchers and other election officials who believe in the system and, despite their own party affiliation, are mostly committed to the success of our democracy.\nThat's how most Americans feel. That's certainly how the current President of the United States feels.\nQ: But it was as recently as late August, during a fundraiser, the President said that he was tired of talking about Donald Trump and he felt like he didn't need to make a case against him because he felt that Donald Trump was making the case against himself very well. And that was eight weeks ago. What has changed the President's mind so distinctly that now he will take a question about Trump and he'll run with it?\nMR. EARNEST: I think some of it is that he is concerned about some of the claims that are being made. He is concerned about the incessant, false claim that the election is subject, or at least susceptible to rigging. Undermining our democracy in that way is not good. It doesn't benefit the country. It may benefit one person in our country, but it doesn't benefit our system. And it certainly is inconsistent with the long, bipartisan tradition of respecting the outcome of our political elections.\nAnd the President himself indicated his own commitment to this principle in his answer yesterday. In the event that the American people do choose Donald Trump to be the 45th President of the United States, the President would have grave concerns about that, but the President would be committed to ensuring a seamless and smooth transition in power, and would, as the President noted yesterday, personally escort Mr. Trump to Capitol Hill so that he could participate in the inauguration.\nThat is what the previous 43 Presidents have done. That is what the 43rd President of the United States, a Republican, did for the 44th Democratic President of the United States. And the President would certainly fulfill that tradition, even if it meant helping somebody that he vigorously disagrees with. And that would mean putting aside his own personal feelings because of his commitment to our country and our democracy.\nQ: So is he no longer tired of talking about Donald Trump and he no longer feels that Donald Trump is making a case against himself?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I think I feel confident speaking for everybody in this room in saying that we all are tired of it. (Laughter.)\nToluse.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Senator Rubio said in a statement today that he's not going to talk about the WikiLeaks emails. He basically said that Democrats were being targeted today by the Russians and it could be Republicans tomorrow. Do you agree with that stance? And if it is Republicans tomorrow, would you say that Democrats shouldn't capitalize on those emails?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not aware that Democrats have. I think what I'll say is that you've seen the way that I've handled it, which is that I've been very reluctant to comment on the emails of a private citizen that were stolen, particularly when we know that the tactics for stealing and disseminating that information, according to our intelligence community, are at least similar to the tactics that are used by the Russian government to undermine confidence in our political system.\nSo I've been very reluctant to discuss reports about those stolen emails. But everybody is going to have to make up their own decision, make up their own mind about the most appropriate way to answer those questions.\nQ: I think I was sort of trying to get at if there was a Russian-inspired hack of Donald Trump's tax returns or his business dealings, are you confident that Democrats wouldn't capitalize on media reports about that and would take the same --\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I think everybody would have to make up their own mind about how they want to handle that situation. But I've obviously been loath to discuss publically the stolen private emails of a private citizen.\nQ: So somewhat similarly about WikiLeaks, the question about the Ecuadorian decision now to -- or to cut Assange's Internet. You were a little bit, I guess, indirect about whether or not the U.S. government was involved at all.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not sure that's true, but if there's an opportunity for me to clarify I will endeavor to do so.\nQ: Does the U.S. government support that decision?\nMR. EARNEST: This is a decision that's made by a sovereign government, so I'm not going to weigh in one way or the other. The Ecuadorian foreign minister put out a statement indicating that they made this decision; they didn't do it because anybody asked them to, they did it because they believed it was in the best interest of their country. Why they have reached that conclusion is something that you should direct to them.\nQ: Just one more. The U.N. Humanitarian Chief said that the United Nation believes up to 1.5 million in Mosul will be at great risk for being targeted, or caught in the crossfire, or forcibly expelled, or used as human shields in the effort to free that city. Can you talk a little bit about what the administration, what the military has seen so far in terms of the humanitarian impact of the efforts to free Mosul, and what's being done to limit the human casualties?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the first fact that I want to mention -- because it's important that it not be overlooked -- you cited that as this operation is undertaken, it could potentially put the citizens of Mosul at great risk. The citizens of Mosul are already at great risk. We already know that they're subject to violence. We already know that they're used as human shields. We already know that some of them have faced violence and humiliation and targeting just because of their religious views or because they may have not been sufficiently supportive of the self-appointed ISIL leadership of that community.\nSo the humanitarian situation in Mosul is already grave. And the potential for certain humanitarian contingencies should not be used as an excuse to put off undertaking this operation. What we should do, and what the international community has done, as the President acknowledged yesterday, is to plan for those potential contingencies. And this planning has been led by the United Nations, with the strong support of the rest of the international community.\nAnd so there are billions of dollars that have been pledged by the United States and the rest of the international community to plan for the humanitarian consequences of clearing ISIL from communities all across Iraq; that we have had important success in helping people move back into cities like Ramadi and Tikrit. These are cities that ISIL previously controlled. These are communities that ISIL sabotaged on their way out the door. And the international community, with the important influence of the U.N., but in a way that was entirely supportive of the sovereignty of the Iraqi central government, worked to rebuild those communities, worked to help citizens return to their homes in those communities, worked to ensure that there was a police force on the ground to protect law and order in those communities. And that's been an important effort.\nAll across Iraq, nearly 1 million Iraqis have returned to their homes, including 95 percent of the population from Tikrit and about 200,000 people who have returned to Ramadi. So there is a template for managing situations like this.\nWhat's also true -- and I think why your question is an important one -- is that Mosul is the second-largest city in Iraq. There's a large population. Mosul is larger than Tikrit and Ramadi. So we're dealing with a contingency that could be on a much larger scale. And that's why, for the last several months, you've seen an Iraqi-led, U.N.-coordinated effort to mobilize resources -- everything from food and water to medicine and temporary housing facilities -- so that if a humanitarian contingency does arise that there are resources in place to deal with it.\nSo this is a significant challenge, and it will require the rest of the international community being deeply engaged to make sure that this is a success -- not just in terms of carrying out the military operation, but also in terms of rebuilding and restoring a community that I think will find, once ISIL has been driven out, has really taken a toll because of the depraved tactics that are regularly used by ISIL.\nDave.\nQ: Josh, thanks. Back on the Project Veritas story. I understand why you don't want to comment on the video itself, but in a general sense, can you assure voters that the DNC is not engaging in dirty tricks in this campaign?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, what I can assure you of is that the statements that you saw from Democratic officials that Kevin alluded to utterly disavowed those tactics. And I think you've heard me disavow those tactics. And so there should be no misunderstanding that the use of violence or any other things that could be construed as a dirty trick is not condoned by the President of the United States, and is not consistent with the kinds of values that we cherish in this democracy, particularly when you consider the stakes in this election, and particularly when you consider the broad appeal for the arguments that are being put forward by Democrats.\nDemocrats should be quite confident in the persuasive power of our arguments. And it's important for us to make sure that those arguments are heard and that people are sufficiently motivated to get out to the polls and cast votes that reflect the persuasive power of those arguments.\nQ: Is the President a friend of Bob Creamer?\nMR. EARNEST: That's not how I would describe him. Kevin alluded to the fact that Mr. Creamer may have been at the White House a number of times, but, no, he's not a friend of the President.\nJean, I'll give you the last one. Susan, I'll give you the last one. So, Jean, we'll --\nQ: Thank you very much. If Hillary Clinton is elected President of the United States, will you go after the Obama administration's policy toward North Korea?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think that's probably a question that you should direct to her campaign. They can talk about what she will do as President of the United States. I think I can just speak in general terms that obviously having served as a Secretary of State under President Obama, she played an important role in strengthening our relationships throughout the Asia Pacific that have put the United States in a better position to confront North Korea for their destabilizing activities and their willingness to violate a wide range of international obligations.\nBut with regard to what she would do as President of the United States, I'd encourage you to touch base with her campaign.\nQ: What is President Obama's final destination of the North Korean nuclear issue?\nMR. EARNEST: What's the final destination?\nQ: Yes.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, the President's foremost concern is doing what's necessary to protect the American people. And the President has also made a deep commitment to ensuring that the United States will stand with our allies in the face of the provocations from the North Koreans. And that's why you've seen talks with the South Korean government to deploy a counter-ballistic-missile battery in South Korea advance as quickly and as far as they have.\nThere's been a deployment of other radar and anti-missile systems in Japan and in Guam and other places throughout the Asia Pacific to better protect our allies and the American people. And that's our foremost concern.\nBut we also are going to continue to work with the rest of the international community to further isolate the North Korean regime and apply additional pressure to them to convince them that they should pursue the kind of policies that are in the best interests of their people and in the best interests of what should be a shared goal of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.\nQ: Could it be more aggressively approaching North Korea?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have a policy change to signal at this point, but the President's foremost concern is the safety and security of the American people and our allies. And I think that's been consistent with the kinds of policies that the President has implemented over his eight years in office.\nSusan, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: I wanted to follow up on Dave's question, and then I have a question of my own. So how would you describe the President's relationship with Bob Creamer?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I'm not sure that I can describe it because I'm not sure that there's much of one. I know that they have met before, but I -- again --\nQ: They met 40 times personally, and he was here 300 times.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we can get you some more details on that. I don't want you to rely on those and leave people with the suggestion that somehow these are 40 different one-on-one meetings in the Oval Office. That would not be true. But we'll see if we can get you some more information about that.\nQ: That would be helpful, because it's out there on the Interwebs saying that he's been here, and they're showing the records from the White House.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, I know why they're out there. They're out there because the Obama administration is the most transparent White House in American history, and we can have this conversation because we have disclosed that information proactively. We do that on a regular basis. So it is a good thing.\nQ: It also empowers us to ask the question of why he's there.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, and we welcome that kind of accountability and transparency, and we should be having this conversation.\nQ: I have a question about Merrick Garland. And I'm wondering if the President would like to see him confirmed in the next legislative session after the election.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, the President believes that Merrick Garland is somebody who can serve the American people on the Supreme Court with distinction, and he absolutely believes the United States Senate, in particular Republicans in the United States Senate, should do their job. They should consider his nomination. They should meet with him. They should give him a hearing and they should give him a vote. And the fact that he's waited more than 200 days for that vote is appalling when you consider the credentials that he has.\nHe is the most experienced Supreme Court nominee in history when you consider that he served more years on the federal judiciary than any other Supreme Court nominee in history. He is somebody who is rated by the American Bar Association as unanimously well-qualified. He is somebody who's been described by Republicans as a consensus pick. And he is somebody who has demonstrated a clear commitment and expertise when it comes to public service.\nHe prosecuted -- or he led the investigation and prosecution of one of the worst terror acts in American history. So he's put terrorists behind bars. He knows what it takes to keep the American people safe.\nThat's why the President -- for all those reasons, that's why the President has put him forward. And it is outrageous that Republicans in the Senate have refused to even meet with him even though they don't call into question his credentials.\nQ: Do you have a commitment from Hillary Clinton if she becomes President to nominate him again?\nMR. EARNEST: No, we don't. If the vacancy has not been filled when she takes office, she will be the President of the United States and she will be able to put forward whomever she believes should fill the vacancy. And I hasten to add that she has said many times that the President made an excellent choice when nominating Merrick Garland.\nAnd I think that is part of why you have seen basically unanimous support among Democrats on Capitol Hill for this nomination. Those Democrats recognize the same thing that Secretary Clinton does, which is that he is enormously qualified. He is a devout public servant, and he's somebody who could serve with honor and distinction on the Supreme Court. But when she's elected President, she will be the one that is entrusted with the power to nominate Chief Judge Garland or someone else to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court.\nQ: You see where I'm going with this. But do you feel like it would be hypocritical for Republicans to vote in favor of Merrick Garland or push his nomination after saying that they wouldn't if they turn around and do so in the next legislation if Hillary Clinton were to be elected? I know there's some hypotheticals in that, but do you think it would be hypocritical for Republicans to turn around and vote in favor of Merrick Garland and push his nomination in the next legislative session?\nMR. EARNEST: I'll try to answer your question as directly as I can, which is that every member of the United States Senate, including Republicans, swore an oath to fulfill their duties as a United States senator, and to do so upholding the Constitution of the United States. And the fact is Republicans have not done their job. Unfortunately, Leader McConnell actually spent part of his seven-week vacation bragging about not doing his job. That would explain some of his party's standing in the polls.\nBut it also is having a negative impact on our federal judiciary as a country. There were at least a couple of high-profile cases that were heard in the Supreme Court earlier this year where the Court was unable to reach a decision because they were split 4 to 4. And so it's starting to have an impact on the functioning of the highest court in the land.\nAnd that has impact on the country, where you essentially have a law interpreted different ways, based on where people live. And that is not a path that we want to go down when we're talking about policies that have a direct impact on our constitutional rights as Americans.\nSo, look, the point I'm trying to make here is, Republicans have forced Merrick Garland to wait 217 days. And even after waiting 217 days, he is still not being given the opportunity to have a hearing and his nomination has still not received a vote.\nQ: Would he actively advise Democrats, if they win the Senate, to push his nomination through? And do you have a commitment from them to do so if they win the Senate?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, the President is certainly going to urge the United States Senate to confirm Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court, and he's been doing that for 217 days and unfortunately, Republicans have refused to do their job. The reason they haven't don't their job is because they know that if they gave him a hearing, he would impress people and they don't want to have to face questions about why they won't vote for him. So they figured it will just be easier if we don't give him a hearing. That way, people are less likely to raise questions about the fact that we won't vote to confirm him because we won't be able to explain why we can't confirm him.\nSo Michelle was talking about the notion of the word \"rigged\" being injected into our political system. Yes, with regard to the way that Merrick Garland has been treated, it's been rigged against him by Republicans in a way that --\nQ: Do you have a commitment from Harry Reid or Chuck Schumer to push his nomination through if they win the Senate?\nMR. EARNEST: So I'm not aware of any sort of commitment like that. What I have seen is both Senator Reid and Senator Schumer, and just about every other Democrat in the United States Senate say that Merrick Garland would do an excellent job on the Supreme Court.\nAnd after the election, regardless of the outcome, the President is going to continue to make a strong case that the United States Senate should act on Chief Judge Garland's nomination.\nThere's no real question here about his credentials. Even Republicans acknowledge -- the few of them that have agreed to meet with him have acknowledged that he is somebody of the highest integrity and has the intellectual firepower that's necessary to ably protect the constitutional rights of the American people in serving on the Supreme Court.\nSo this has nothing to do with his credentials. Again, it's very difficult to find a reason to oppose him, which is why Republicans don't even want to consider him. And that's unfortunate in part because it's their job to consider him. They ran for this job. No one asked them to do it. No one forced them to do it. They ran for this job, to accept this responsibility to ensure the effective functioning of the third branch of government. And that's being undermined right now because of Republicans' willingness to abdicate one of their most basic responsibilities in the United States Senate.\nHopefully this will be a topic of some discussion in the debate tonight, so we'll tune in to find out.\nThank you, guys.\nEND 2:12 P.M.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "note": "As prepared for delivery.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119184", "text": "Thank you.\nIn 19 days, we are going to win the state of Ohio and we are going to win the White House.\nEarly voting is underway, so make sure to mail in your ballot or vote in-person.\nLadies and Gentlemen, I want to make a major announcement today. I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters, and to all of the people of the United States, that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic Presidential election – if I win!\nALTERNATE:\nLadies and Gentlemen, I want to make a major announcement today. I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters, and to all of the people of the United States, that when the results come in on election night, I will accept – without delay or hesitation – the concession speech of Hillary Rodham Clinton.\nNow, seriously, the debate last night was amazing and everybody said I won, including every single online poll, some by 90-10.\nThe question of voter fraud came up during the debate. We want fairness in the election, having nothing to do with me and having to do with the future of the country.\nJohn Podesta, Hillary's Campaign Chairman, was quoted in WikiLeaks, as saying illegal immigrants could vote as long as they have Drivers' Licenses.\nOne of the big issues that came up last night was the fact that the Clinton Campaign has paid people to disrupt our rallies and incite violence. This is criminal behavior that violates centuries of tradition on peaceful, Democratic elections.\nA campaign like Clinton's that will incite violence is truly a campaign that will do anything.\nAnd a candidate, like Hillary Clinton, who will lie to the Congress and the FBI, destroy 33,000 emails, put her office up for sale, and put our confidential information in reach of our enemies – is a candidate who is truly capable of anything.\nIn addition, it was just learned, Hillary was given the exact debate questions, word for word, by Donna Brazile – who is now under tremendous pressure to resign. But I ask you, why shouldn't Hillary Clinton resign from the race – she was given the questions, used the questions, and never said that she did something that was totally inappropriate?\nYears ago there was a show called the $64,000 question – he got the questions in advance, his life was ruined. This is even bigger, because we are playing for the presidency of the United States.\nHillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the Presidency.\nSo it's in that context I was asked a question about whether I would agree, in advance, to concede the results on election night. This is an unprecedented question. If Al Gore or George Bush had agreed 3 weeks before the election to concede the results and waive their right to a legal challenge or a recount, then there would be no Supreme Court case and no Bush V. Gore.\nIn effect, I'm being asked to waive centuries of legal precedent designed to protect the franchise of voters.\nAccording to Pew, there are 24 million voter registrations in the United States that are either invalid or significantly inaccurate.\n1.8 million dead people are registered to vote (some of whom vote even though they are dead – which is a hard thing to do, but easy if fraud is involved).\n2.8 million people are registered in more than one state.\nAnd 14% of non-citizens are registered to vote.\nSo what I'm saying is, we have to be vigilant and we have to be careful.\nAmerica is a Constitutional Republic with a system of laws. These laws are triggered in the case of fraud, or in the event a recount is needed.\nOf course I would accept a clear election result, but I would also reserve my right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result. I will follow and abide by all of the rules and traditions of all the candidates who came before me.\nBut, none of this will matter, since we are going to win big on November 8th.\nTogether, we are going to deliver real change that puts America First.\nWe are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, unleash job-producing American energy, rebuild our military and take care of our Vets, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.\nYour jobs will come back under a Trump Administration. Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration. Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration. Your companies won't be leaving Ohio under a Trump Administration.\nRight now, our economy isn't growing at all. I'm going to get us to 4% growth and create 25 million jobs over 10 years.\nMany workers are earning less today than they were 18 years ago, they are working harder and longer, but making less. Some of them are working two, three jobs but still taking home less money.\nCompanies, like Carrier are firing their workers and moving to Mexico. Ford is moving all of its small car production to Mexico. When I'm President, if companies want to fire their workers and leave for Mexico, then we will charge them a 35% tax when they want to ship their products back in. That means the companies won't leave in the first place and, if they do, we'll at least make money when they ship their products across the border.\nRight now, our politicians don't do anything to keep our companies from leaving because they are controlled by lobbyists and special interests – Hillary Clinton has raised countless millions of dollars from big donors who want to ship our jobs to other countries.\nThat is why I am proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again.\nIt's time to drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, D.C.\nThose reforms include the following:\nA 5 year-ban on executive branch and congressional officials lobbying the government after they leave government service.\nA lifetime ban on former executive branch officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government.\nA ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections.\nAdditionally, I am going to push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress.\nIt's about time.\nNot only will we end our government corruption, but we will end the economic stagnation.\nMy plan for the economy can be summed up in three simple words: jobs, jobs, jobs.\nAt the center of my historic jobs plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals.\n47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps.\nWe have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world, and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.\nOhio has lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA and China's entrance into the World Trade Organization – two Bill and Hillary-backed disasters.\nWe are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.\nA Trump Administration is going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to foreign cheating, and stop the jobs from leaving our country.\nI also have another major announcement I am going to make today that concerns manufacturing in the United States, and how we are going to bring jobs back to Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and all across this great nation.\nAmerican trade policy is currently mismanaged by dozens of competing bureaucracies spread across the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, State and Treasury Department and the U.S. Trade Representative.\nIn my administration, all trade policymaking will be consolidated in one Office. It will report to an American Desk and it will be located inside the Department of Commerce. The mission of the American Desk will be to protect the economic interests of the American worker, and the national interests of the United States.\nIt's going to be America First.\nAs part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we are going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent.\nWe are also going to rebuild our inner cities.\nAfrican-Americans and Hispanics living in the inner cities are suffering. The violence is unbearable. You walk to the store with your child and you get shot. There is no education, there are no jobs, there is no safety.\nNearly 3,500 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.\nHomicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.\nAnd it's getting worse.\nTo the African-American and Hispanic voters suffering, I say: what do you have to lose? Vote for Donald Trump. I will fix it.\nWe will be a rich nation once again.\nBut to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.\nNational Security begins at the border.\nSpeaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally \"open trade and open borders.\"\nHillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East – meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores.\nJust last week, an Iraqi refugee approved for entry by Hillary Clinton's State Department pled guilty to joining ISIS.\nSo let me state this as clearly as I can. If I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.\nWe will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration.\nA Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes, we will build a wall.\nWe have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers.\nThere is another major policy announcement I would like to make today. Every year, countless American lives are lost to Sanctuary Cities. My opponent strongly supports Sanctuary Cities, like the ones that got Kate Steinle killed by a five-time deported criminal illegal immigrant.\nIf I am elected President, I am going to cut off federal funding to Sanctuary Cities that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.\nWe are going to save American lives.\nEither we win this election, or we lose the country.\nHere are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:\nWe are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every low-income child in America, and we are going to end common core; support the men and women of law enforcement; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\nYou have 19 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true.\nOur campaign is powered by our love for this country and our love for our fellow citizens. It's a campaign about rejecting the cynicism and elitism of our failed political establishment.\nI am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation.\nI'm going to fight for every child living in poverty. I'm going to fight for every mom whose lost her child to illegal immigration, and drugs and gang violence.\nI'm going to fight for every community whose jobs and factories have been ripped out of states like Ohio and shipped to other countries.\nI'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people – not the donors and special interests.\nAnd I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\nYou're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like you've never seen before. You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time.\nBecause if we win –\nWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.", "timestamp": "2016-10-20", "title": "Remarks at the Delaware County Fairgrounds in Delaware, Ohio"}

If I win. That is a direct quote from Donald Trump. Well obviously, Donald, that is not accepting the results. You've got to accept the results of this election, win or lose. That's the pledge we made. Hillary stood on the stage in the first debate and said, 'Of course I'm going to accept the results of the election.' And that Donald Trump was unwilling to make that pledge, and still thinks he's saying something positive by saying, 'I'll accept the results if I win' shows he has a profound misunderstanding of the institutions of government and that he is trying to do something and upset a tradition that has been one of the most notable features of American democracy.\"", "timestamp": "2016-10-20", "title": "Statement by Tim Kaine on Trump's Most Recent Comment About Accepting Election Outcome"}

Also, according to Esquire, Guccifer told journalists that he gave the DNC emails to WikiLeaks:\n\"The new public data confirming the Russians are behind the hack of John Podesta's email is a big deal. There is no longer any doubt that Putin is trying to help Donald Trump by weaponizing WikiLeaks. Despite all the evidence, including the conclusions of the US intelligence community, Donald Trump went on the debate stage and acted as Putin's puppet, defending Russia and refusing to admit and condemn the Kremlin's actions. This behavior has gone from bizarre to disqualifying. In light of his associate's admitted 'back-channeling' with Assange, and Trump's own undisclosed business ties with Russia, it's time for Trump to tell the American people what he knew about these hacks and when he knew it.\"\nAccording to Esquire:\n\"In the weeks that followed, Guccifer offered interviews and batches of documents to several journalists, but he wrote that \"the main part of the papers, thousands of files and mails, I gave to WikiLeaks.\"\n\"So far U. S. investigators have not said publicly who was responsible for the Podesta hack, but the data harvested by SecureWorks makes it clear that Fancy Bear broke into the Clinton chairman's account as early as late March. The CIA briefed Trump about the origin of the kompromat, but he continued to cite the material, telling a Pennsylvania crowd, \"I love WikiLeaks!\"\nAccording to Motherboard:\nMonths later, on October 9, WikiLeaks began publishing thousands of Podesta's hacked emails. Almost everyone immediately pointed the finger at Russia, who is suspected of being behind a long and sophisticated hacking campaign that has the apparent goal of influencing the upcoming US elections. But there was no public evidence proving the same group that targeted the Democratic National Committee was behind the hack on Podesta—until now.\nThe data linking a group of Russian hackers—known as Fancy Bear, APT28, or Sofacy—to the hack on Podesta is also yet another piece in a growing heap of evidence pointing toward the Kremlin. And it also shows a clear thread between apparently separate and independent leaks that have appeared on a website called DC Leaks, such as that of Colin Powell's emails; and the Podesta leak, which was publicized on WikiLeaks.", "timestamp": "2016-10-20", "title": "Jake Sullivan Statement on Breaking News That Confirms Russia Is Behind The Hack of John Podesta's Emails"}
{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "note": "Remarks as delivered.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119497", "text": "Secretary Clinton: \"Thank you. Your Eminence, Your Excellencies, members of the clergy, Al and Nan Smith, Donald and Melania, and all the distinguished guests.\nYou know, earlier tonight, Al reminded me that when the first Al Smith ran for presi-dent, he chose as his running mate the progressive senator from Arkansas, Joseph T. Robinson, who was one of my husband's political heroes.\nThis work that you do through the dinner — Al, you've done it now for 30 — 30 years — is such a labor of love. You've been a hero for both the children of the archdiocese and for the city of New York. And I think we all owe Al Smith a great, great round of applause.\nThis is such a special event that I took a break from my rigorous nap schedule to be here.\nAnd as you've already heard, it's a treat for all of you too, because usually I charge a lot for speeches like this.\nBut, for me, it was kind of ironic thinking about a fiery populist, Al Smith. If he were here today and saw how much money we've raised for needy children, he'd be very proud.\nAnd if he saw this magnificent room, full of plutocrats celebrating his legacy, he'd be very confused.\nIt's a special honor to be here with Your Eminence. Now I know, Your Eminence, you were criticized for inviting both Donald and me here tonight, and you responded by saying \"If I only sat down with those who were saints, I'd be taking all my meals alone.\"\nNow, just to be clear, I think the Cardinal is saying I'm not eligible for sainthood. But getting through these three debates with Donald has to count as a miracle.\nSo I guess I'm up against the highest, hardest stained-glass ceiling. But, Your Eminence, you deserve great credit for bringing together two people who've been at each other's throats — mortal enemies, bitter foes; I've got to ask, how did you get the governor and mayor here together tonight?\nNow, I've got to say, there are a lot of friendly faces here in this room; people that I've been privileged to know and to work with. I just want to put you all in a basket of adorables.\nAnd you look so good in your tuxes; or, as I refer to them, formal pantsuits.\nAnd, you know, because this is a friendly dinner for such a great cause; Donald, if at any time, you don't like what I'm saying feel free to stand up and shout \"Wrong!\" while I'm talking.\nYou know, come to think of it, it's amazing I'm up here after Donald. I didn't think he'd be okay with a peaceful transition of power.\nAnd, Donald, after listening to your speech, I will also enjoy listening to Mike Pence deny that you ever gave it.\nYou know, I've had the privilege of being at the Al Smith dinners in years past and I always enjoy it. But, remember, if you're not happy with the way it comes out, it must be rigged.\nAnd it's always a special treat for me to be back in New York; a city that I love and which I think truly embodies the best of America. You know — don't you think?\nPeople look at the Statue of Liberty and they see a proud symbol of our history as a nation of immigrants, a beacon of hope for people around the world. Donald looks at the Statue of Liberty and sees a \"four.\"\nMaybe a \"five\" if she loses the torch and tablet and changes her hair.\nYou know, come to think of it, you know what would be a good number for a woman? Forty-five.\nBut I digress. Now, I'm going to try my best tonight, but I understand I am not known for my sense of humor. That's why it did take a village to write these jokes.\nPeople say — and I hear them, I know — they say I'm boring compared to Donald. But I'm not boring at all. In fact, I'm the life of every party I attend and I've been to three.\nAnd when the parties get out of hand, as occasionally they do, it's important to have a responsible chaperone who can get everyone home safely. And that is why I picked Tim Kaine to be my Vice President.\nNow, you notice there is no teleprompter here tonight, which is probably smart, because maybe you saw Donald dismantle his prompter the other day. And I get that. They're hard to keep up with, and I'm sure it's even harder when you're translating from the original Russian.\nBut every year, this dinner brings together a collection of sensible, committed, main-stream Republicans — or, as we now like to call them — Hillary supporters.\nNow, some of my critics — and I hear that too —\nAudience Member: Yeah.\nSecretary Clinton: Yeah.\nThey think I only say what people want to hear. Well, tonight, that is true. And here's exactly what you want to hear — this election will be over very, very soon.\nAnd look at this dais — we've got Charlie Rose, and Maria Bartiromo, and Chris Mat-thews, and Gayle King, and Norah O'Donnell, and Katie Couric — this counts as a press conference, right?\nIt is great, also, to see Mayor Bloomberg here.\nIt's a shame he's not speaking tonight. I'm curious to hear what a billionaire has to say.\nAnd look at the dais — we've got the Honorable Chuck Schumer, the Honorable Andrew Cuomo, the Honorable Mike Bloomberg, the Honorable Bill DeBlasio, the Honorable Dave Dinkins, and so many other wonderful elected officials. And we have Rudy Giuliani.\nNow, many don't know this, but Rudy actually got his start as a prosecutor going after wealthy New Yorkers who avoided paying taxes. But, as the saying goes, \"If you can't beat them, go on Fox News and call them a genius.\"\nSo as I've said, we've now had our third and, thankfully, final debate. Sharing a stage with Donald Trump is like, well, nothing really comes to mind.\nThere is nothing like sharing a stage with Donald Trump. Donald wanted me drug tested before last night's debate. And look, I've got to tell you, I am so flattered that Donald thought I used some sort of performance enhancer.\nNow, actually, I did. It's called preparation.\nAnd looking back, I've had to listen to Donald for three full debates. And he says I don't have any stamina.\nThat is four and a half hours. I have now stood next to Donald Trump longer than any of his campaign managers.\nNow, look, I have deep respect for people like Kellyanne Conway. She's working day and night for Donald and because she's a contractor, he's probably not even going to pay her.\nBut I think the good news is that the debates finally allowed Republicans to unite around their candidate. The bad news is, it's Mike Pence. And it's been a long, long campaign. That should be one of our highest priorities, shortening the campaigns.\nAnd whoever wins this election, the outcome will be historic. We'll either have the first female president or the first president who started a Twitter war with Cher.\nAnd if Donald does win, it will be awkward at the annual President's Day photo, when all the former presidents gather at the White House, and not just with Bill.\nHow is Barack going to get past the Muslim ban?\nNow, Republicans in particular seem frustrated with their nominee. Paul Ryan told the Republican members of the House, you — you don't have to support the top of the ticket. Don't worry about anyone besides yourself. Just do what's in your own best interests. So I guess Donald really has unified his party around his core philosophy.\nAnd I don't understand their unhappiness. They say Donald doesn't have any policies. He has no policies. I keep hearing that.\nI'd actually like to defend him on this. Donald has issues, serious issues.\nReally, really serious issues.\nAnd I worry about Donald's go it alone attitude. For example, at his convention, when he said I alone can fix it, you know, in the '90s, I said the same thing about America's health care system and it didn't work out so well for me, either.\nBut speaking of health, Donald has been very concerned about mine, very concerned. He actually sent a car to bring me here tonight. Actually, it was a hearse.\nBut I — but I kind of want to just put the information out there, so everybody can draw their own conclusions and you can judge our relative health. We've each released our medical records. My blood pressure is 100/70. His is unbelievably great.\nMy cholesterol is 189, his is presidential.\nMy heart rate is 72 beats per minute, his is the most beats ever, or the least beats ever, whichever sounds best.\nBut Donald really is as healthy as a horse, you know, the one Vladimir Putin rides around on.\nBut — but I can say without fear of contradiction tonight, that I will be the healthiest and youngest woman ever to serve as president.\nBut this has really been a strange campaign. You saw it last night. You saw it again tonight. Donald has attacked me for a life in public service and I didn't get that at first. I kind of get it now. As he told Howard Stern, he doesn't like it when women have been around for more than 35 years.\nBut Donald, we have so much more in common than, actually, you may realize.\nFor example, I tried to inspire young people by showing them that with resilience and hard work anything is possible and you're doing the same. A third grade teacher told me that one of her students refused to turn in his homework because it was under audit.\nAnd here's another similarity. The Republican National Committee isn't spending a dime to help either one of us.\nSo tonight, let's embrace the spirit of the evening. Let's come together. Remember what unites us and just rip on Ted Cruz.\nI hope you enjoyed my remarks tonight. I said no to some jokes that I thought were over the line. But I suppose you can judge for yourself on Wikileaks in the next few days.\nDonald will tell us after the benediction whether he accepts that this dinner is over. He has to wait and see.\nBut there's nothing funny about the stakes in this election. In the end what makes this dinner important are not the jokes we tell but the legacy that we carry forward. It is often easy to forget how far this country has come.\nAnd there are a lot of people in this room tonight who themselves, or their parents or grandparents, came here as immigrants, made a life for yourselves, took advantage of the American dream and the greatest system that has ever been created in the history of the world to unleash the individual talents and energy and ambition of everyone willing to work hard.\nAnd when I think about what Al Smith went through it's important to just reflect how groundbreaking it was for him, a Catholic, to be my party's nominee for president. Don't forget – school boards sent home letters with children saying that if Al Smith is elected president you will not be allowed to have or read a Bible. Voters were told that he would annul Protestant marriages.\nAnd I saw a story recently that said people even claimed the Holland Tunnel was a se-cret passageway to connect Rome and America, to help the Pope rule our country.\nThose appeals, appeals to fear and division, can cause us to treat each other as the Other. Rhetoric like that makes it harder for us to see each other, to respect each other, to listen to each other. And certainly a lot harder to love our neighbor as ourselves.\nI believe how we treat others is the highest expression of faith and of service. I'm not Catholic. I'm a Methodist, but one of the things that we share is the belief that in order to achieve salvation we need both faith and good works. And you certainly don't need to be Catholic to be inspired by the humility and heart of the Holy Father, Pope Francis. Or to embrace his message.\nHis message about rejecting a mindset of hostility, his calls to reduce inequality, his warnings about climate change, his appeal that we build bridges, not walls.\nNow as you may know, my running mate, Tim, is Catholic and went to Jesuit schools, and one of the things he and I have talked about is this idea from the Jesuits of the Magis, the more, the better. But we need to get better at finding ways to disagree on matters of policy while agreeing on questions of decency and civility. How we talk to each other, treat each other, respect each other.\nSo I've taken this concept of Magis to heart in this campaign, as best as one can in the daily heat, the back and forth of a presidential campaign, to ask how we can do more for each other, and better for each other. Because I believe that for each of us, our greatest monument on this earth won't be what we build, but the lives we touch.\nAnd that is ultimately what this dinner is all about. And it's why it's been such a great honor to join you all again. Thank you.\"", "timestamp": "2016-10-20", "title": "Remarks at the 71st Annual Alfred E.

Welcome aboard Air Force One en route to Miami, where the President will deliver remarks at Miami Dade College about the Affordable Care Act and the progress we've made to improve our health care system. The President will discuss what more can be done to advance affordable, accessible, quality health care in this country, and the robust enrollment period we're expecting starting on November the 1st, less than two weeks from now.\nAs you all know, because of the Affordable Care Act, 20 million more Americans now know the financial security and peace of mind that comes with having health insurance. Our health care costs are growing at the slowest rate in decades, and improvements to our health care system, thanks to the law, are keeping patients healthier and letting doctors practice medicine the way they'd like.\nFor additional background on why we're headed to Miami Dade, let me tell you that this is an institution that's been involved from day one in educating their students, faculty, staff, and surrounding community about open enrollment. They've hosted dozens of enrollment days with in-person assisters on all nine campuses throughout the county. They've sent regular email reminders to all their students around deadlines, and regularly use their social media platforms to amplify open enrollment.\nOne other thing I wanted to draw to your attention this morning is that today, on our website, at WhiteHouse.gov, we're launching a new feature highlighting the letters that the President has received during his time in office. Many of you know that every night the President receives 10 letters written to him by Americans from around the country, and this first set posted today comprises Affordable Care Act letters that the President has received over the last seven and a half years. So we hope you'll check them out. And we'll continue to add letters on this topic and a range of others over the next few months.\nWith that, I'm happy to take your questions.\nQ: Are the letters just on health care, or will they be about other subjects in the future?\nMR. SCHULTZ: We're going to be uploading letters on a whole host of topics. The ones we uploaded today, this sort of inaugural batch, are on the Affordable Care Act.\nQ: And will they be done in like chunks of different topics? Like, each dispatch will have the same topic kind of idea?\nMR. SCHULTZ: For today, I can tell you that today's letters are about the Affordable Care Act and what this legislation has meant to people who have been able to use it. They're amongst the 20 million people who have gotten health insurance based on the Affordable Care Act. They've written really meaningful, touching stories. These are the stories that inspire this President to make sure this law is working as best as it can. So we're going to continue to share those stories and stories on a range of other issues facing Americans.\nQ: Was the President watching the debate last night? And if so, what was his reaction to Donald Trump refusing to commit to accept the results of the election in November?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Jordan, I think before we left off, the President sent out a tweet that you may have seen. He thinks these debates have been an opportunity for the American people to see what the President knows firsthand, which is Secretary Clinton is the most qualified nominee to ever be running for President in our nation's history. He believes, as he has said, she brings more experience and qualifications than even he did when he was running for President.\nSo he believes all three of the debates now have been an opportunity for the American people to see that.\nQ: But about Donald Trump specifically refusing to say that he would accept the outcome if he refuses on November 8th.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Darlene, I don't have anything new for you on that. As you know, the President addressed this on Tuesday in the Rose Garden. He made a couple of points that I think are worth emphasizing here. First, he said the peaceful transition of power in our nation is a hallmark of our country. This is what makes America great.\nThe President -- I'm not sure there's anyone more diametrically opposed to what the Republican nominee stands for than this President. But even he said that if this country chooses to elect Mr. Trump, he will pursue a peaceful transfer of power. He will escort him to the Capitol. That will be some car ride. (Laughter.) But that's in the best interest of our nation, and that's consistent with hundreds of years of tradition.\nThe other thing I would draw your attention to is the President's plans for a peaceful transfer of power aren't starting now. They've actually been in the works for months now. We have stood up resources and assets to make sure that whoever wins the election in November will be able to smoothly enter office. And so our approach to that has been even-handed. We work just as closely with the Republican campaign as we do with the Democratic campaign. Our Chief of Staff, Denis McDonough, called both campaigns after their conventions to make sure that they were plugging into our transition process seamlessly. So that work is going to continue unabated.\nQ: Is the President doing anything in addition to what he planned to, to make sure that after the election there isn't a problem with the country accepting the results, or some significant segment of a country accepting the results, given this?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, I quibble with a little bit of the premise of your question given that --\nQ: This is Trump sort of saying, I may not accept the results, which, in the past, no one said in advance -- oh, some restrictions apply to accepting the results. And does that cause you to do anything different than you'd planned at all? I don't know. Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Sure, you're right that this is unprecedented. And the President made that remark on Tuesday in the Oval Office. The other point the President made is if you're complaining about the toughness of the race, that probably doesn't portend well for the presidency, that the challenges a candidate faces on the campaign trail pale in terms of the complexities of the issues that a president would face in the Oval Office.\nSo folks will have to judge for themselves whether that's a sign of strength or not. But in terms of the President's approach, what he said Tuesday is still operative -- that any serious investigation or examination into the sort of right-wing allegations of voter fraud, those allegations never withstand scrutiny. There's never much evidence, as you all report, of that happening. And I think that's possibly why the vice presidential candidate, a campaign manager for the Republican nominee continue to insist that they will accept the results of the election.\nQ: Not to belabor the point, but I think what Mike is getting at is there might be some Trump supporters who -- I mean, the question isn't over whether Trump is going to accept the peaceful transition in the event he loses. The question is, what's going to happen on polling places on Election Day; what's going to happen in cities or places where Trump supporters throng afterward? I guess, is the administration taking any specific steps to mitigate any of those concerns ahead of Election Day on November 8th?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Jordan, as you know, we believe the right to vote is sacred, and the President believes that people ought to be able to do that easily and safely and securely. And that's not a new principle for us. I don't have any new measures to announce along those lines to safeguard that principle and to safeguard that constitutional right. And again, the President believes that -- and I think as you all have, to your credit, reported -- there's not a lot of evidence of widespread voter fraud that some on the right continue to allege.\nQ: -- there are Republicans who say that what Trump is doing is simply reserving the right to do the same thing that Al Gore did in 2000. How do you analyze that in that White House?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I noticed that, Christi. And I guess my response is, in 2000, there was an automatic recount triggered in the state of Florida based on the margins of the result. After that was litigated, the Vice President conceded the election gracefully and with dignity. And he did so because it was, indeed, in the best interest of the country.\nSo I'm not sure this is Republicans' best argument. In fact, it seems to argue to the contrary.\nQ: How is it an argument to the contrary?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Because the race in Florida was so close that there was an automatic recount triggered by law, by statute. Once that was decided, Al Gore, much to the dismay of some on the left who were urging him to continue the fight, went ahead and placed his own political self-interests behind the interests of the country and conceded the race to then-Governor Bush.\nQ: Eric, foreign policy unless anyone has another election question? No? So President Duterte was in China, and he said that he's realigned the Philippines with China, and is separating from the U.S., in his words. I'm wondering how this will affect the arrangement giving U.S. forces access to Philippines bases.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Thank you, Roberta. The U.S.-Philippine alliance is built on a 70-year history, rich people-to-people ties, and a long list of shared security concerns. To bluntly answer your question, we have not received any official request from Philippine officials to alter any of our many issues where we bilaterally cooperate. I will tell you that we continue to be the Philippines' strongest economic partner. Current stock of foreign direct investment -- I happen to have this -- is $4.7 billion. And we continue to outpace any other country in terms of direct investment into that country.\nThe last thing I'll say, which gets to your question, is we have always believed, and the President has said repeatedly, that it's in our interest for countries in the Asia Pacific to have strong relationships with a responsible China. We don't consider this a zero-sum game. We believe that it's in our national security interest when our partners and allies in the region have strong relationships with China, consistent with international norms.\nQ: But how does the White House feel about or read these highly negative comments from President Duterte?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Roberta, I'm not sure if you were on our last foreign trip or not --\nQ: Yeah, I was.\nMR. SCHULTZ: -- but the President had an opportunity to discuss President Duterte's remarks. He called them \"colorful.\" As you know, we had to -- we decided to cancel a one-on-one bilateral meeting with him at the time. So I don't have any new reaction for you right now. All I would say is, our relationship with the country and the people of the Philippines goes back decades and is based on deep ties.\nQ: Can I follow up on that? One of the principles that the President pushed really hard for in the South China Sea is that countries would not be forced to negotiate bilaterally with China over these disputed islands and shoals and reefs. I mean, the substance of what Duterte said was, we're now going to negotiate bilaterally with the Chinese. That strikes me as a major defeat for what had been an important part of the President's pivot to Asia. Do you view it that way? And what would the President plan to do to press his point that these negotiations need to be multilateral, not bilateral?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Sure, Mark. I haven't heard anyone in the administration describe it that way. As you point out, our view is -- well, we don't take a side in the dispute. Our view is that these disputes need to be handled through multilateral adjudications and through -- according to rules based on international norms. So there are certain principles at stake here which we adhere to, we expect other countries to adhere to. And that's going to be our policy moving forward.\nQ: Can I ask one question about the Bob Creamer story? So I'm wondering whether there's any more clarity that you can offer on the nature of these meetings that he had in the White House. There are a lot that are listed under visitor logs as \"with POTUS,\" but I understand that that doesn't necessarily imply one-on-one meetings. Can you give us any more clarity on the nature of those meetings?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Thank you, Mark, for the opportunity. Yes, as you know, we are the first administration in history to release the White House visitor logs. I believe the last administration went to the Supreme Court to withhold that information. So I'm pleased to be able to have this conversation with you based on the White House's commitment to transparency.\nWe should insert one caveat at the top, which is the WAVES records, which are disclosed voluntarily and proactively by this administration, don't always reveal real-time information. In other words, this is a database of people who were cleared into the complex, but not necessarily always entered. In other words, you could imagine meetings or large group events where people want to get cleared in, but don't always attend. So we should just sort of stipulate that caveat at the top.\nI don't know if we've had the time to go back and look at every individual visit. I know that a lot of the visits that have been circulating online were large events -- over a thousand people. So as Josh said yesterday, this idea that there were intimate, one-on-one meetings in the Oval Office I don't think is consistent with where the data is. But if we have more information about the visits, we'll let you know.\nQ: Can you say whether there were one-on-one visits?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Again, I don't know if we've looked at each and every one, but I know that a lot of them were large events, over a hundred people, even over a thousand people, from what I could see.\nQ: Is there any reaction to North Korea's latest attempt to launch a missile?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Yes, Darlene. U.S. Strategic Command detected a failed North Korean missile launch near the city of Kusong. The missile is presumed to be an intermediate-range ballistic missile. The North American Aerospace Defense Command determined the missile launch from North Korea did not pose a threat to North America. We strongly condemn this and North Korea's other missile tests which violate U.N. Security Council resolutions explicitly prohibiting North Korea's launches using ballistic missile technology.\nWe believe this provocation only serves to increase the international community's resolve to counter the DPRK's prohibitive activities, including through implementing existing U.N. security sanctions. It also underscores the need for the U.N. Security Council to impose additional strong sanctions in response to the DPRK's nuclear test on September 9th.\nThank you.\nEND 11:42 A.M.

{"author": "Michelle Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=120925", "text": "MRS. OBAMA: Wow! Whoa! Look at those guys! Hello, everyone! (Applause.) Wow. Look at you all, there are a lot of you all in here. (Applause.)\nThank you for waiting in line, all the mags, all the -- it's just such a hassle. Thank you, though. (Applause.)\nYou guys, I am so happy to be here in Phoenix with all of you! Thank you for coming out. (Applause.) But I want to start by thanking a few people, because there are a lot of folks who made this day possible and a lot of folks who are working to get Hillary elected. So let me start by thanking Carolyn, first of all, for that wonderful introduction. (Applause.)\nI also want to recognize your members of Congress -- Representatives Raul Grijalva, Ann Kirkpatrick, to Ann -- Ruben Gallego, as well. Ruben. I want to thank the Navajo Nation Vice President, Jonathan Nez, and, of course, your Mayor, Greg Stanton, who is here. (Applause.)\nBut most of all, I want to thank you all for coming together to support the next President and Vice President of the United States -- Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine! (Applause.) Woohoo!\nNow, you might have heard that last week in New Hampshire, I gave a speech. (Applause.) And let me just say that since then, my office has been flooded with thousands of letters and emails from folks all across the country. Women of all ages finding the courage to stand up and tell their stories, clearing the cloud of shame that existed for far too long. Parents declaring that our daughters -- and our sons -- deserve better. (Applause.) Speaking out for the values of decency and respect that we all hold dear. Men of all backgrounds and walks of life agreeing that decent men do not demean women -- (applause) -- and we shouldn't tolerate this behavior from any man, let alone a man who wants to be the President. (Applause.)\nAnd let me just tell you, I have been so moved and so humbled by these responses -- by the powerful affirmation of our shared values. But what I have not been is surprised. Let me tell you, because this kind of courage and decency and compassion -- this is who we are. This is the America that I know. (Applause.)\nAnd as I've read these letters and emails, I've been reminded of what my husband and I would always talk about when we were out on the campaign trail.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: I love you!\nMRS. OBAMA: I love you, too. (Applause.)\nBut I have been reminded of the importance of hope. Because let me just say this, this is what hope looks like. (Applause.) It's that belief that we can be better, that we can do better for our kids; that even in our darkest hours, there's always a brighter day ahead -- (applause) -- and if we're willing to work for it and fight for it, we can make it happen. (Applause.)\nHope is what keeps our better angels alive. It's been the driving force behind everything we've achieved these last eight years, and it's been at the heart of my life and my husband's life since the day we were born.\nAnd I think one of the reasons this election has been so difficult for so many of us is because that's what's being lost; in all the hateful, hurtful rhetoric we've been hearing, we're losing hope.\nYou see, in this race, we have a candidate whose vision for our country is completely and utterly lacking in hope. A candidate who tells us that our country is desperate and weak, that our communities are in chaos; that our fellow citizens are a threat. A candidate who calls on us to turn against each other, to build walls -- to be afraid.\nWell, Barack and I -- and our friend, Hillary -- (applause) -- we have a very different perspective on this country, one that has everything to do with where we come from and how we were raised. You see, we all grew up in working families. As you know, Barack was raised by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills, and by grandparents who stepped up to help. My dad was a shift worker at the city water plant, and let me tell you, he and my mom scrimped and saved every penny to send me and my brother to college. (Applause.) Hillary's mother was an orphan, abandoned by her parents. Hillary's father -- small business owner -- stayed up nights, poring over his books, working hard to keep their family afloat.\nSee and when you grow up like us -- doing your best to keep it all together -- you come in contact with all kinds of people. And yes, you witness a lot of struggles and hardships. But let me tell you, you also see so many triumph, so much beauty so much joy. That's my life. (Applause.)\nSo you learn empathy. You learn compassion. You learn that folks may not look or think like you, but when it comes to what really matters in life -- our values and our dreams -- we're not all that different. (Applause.)\nYou learn that when folks are down on their luck, it's not because they deserve it. It's not because they're unworthy --because you've seen firsthand that sometimes bad things happen to good people and when times are tough, hope is all you have.\nSo the hope that sustains us isn't some naпve idea that if you sit around and do nothing, everything will be okay. No, no, our hope is grounded in hard work and hard-earned faith. It is grounded in belief that there is something greater than us that reminds us that we are all precious and worthy, no matter where we come from or what we've been through. (Applause.) That's what Barack and I believe. That's what Hillary believes too. (Applause.)\nNow sadly, for some reason, Hillary's opponent comes from a different place. I don't know, perhaps living life high up in a tower, in a world of exclusive clubs, measuring success by wins and losses and the number of zeroes in your bank account -- perhaps you just develop a different set of values. Maybe with so little exposure to people who are different than you are -- becomes easy to take advantage of those who are down on their luck, folks who play by the rules -- pay what they owe -- because to you -- (applause) -- to you those folks just aren't very smart and seem somehow less deserving.\nAnd if you think this way, then it's easy to see this country as \"us\" versus \"them.\" And it's easy to dehumanize \"them\" -- to treat \"them\" with contempt -- because you don't know them. You can't even see them.\nMaybe that's why this candidate thinks certain immigrants are criminals -- instead of folks who work their fingers to the bone to give their kids a better life -- (applause) -- to help build the greatest nation on Earth -- because he doesn't really know them.\nMaybe that's why he thinks we should be afraid of our Muslim brothers and sisters -- because he has no idea who they are. (Applause.) He doesn't understand that they are \"us.\" They are our friends, our family, our neighbors, our colleagues -- people of faith just like so many folks across this country. (Applause.)\nMaybe that's why he sees veterans enduring the wounds of war as weak. And why he insults Gold Star families -- folks who have spent months praying not to get that knock at the door. Heroes who love this country so much they're willing to die for it. He just can't see them. (Applause.)\nMaybe it's easy for him to mock people with disabilities because he is unable to see their strength and contributions. Maybe that's why he demeans and humiliates women, as if we're objects meant solely for pleasure and entertainment, rather than human beings worthy of love and respect. (Applause.) He just doesn't understand us.\nMaybe that's why he calls communities like the one where I was raised \"hell\" -- because he can't see all of the decent, hardworking folks like my parents, who take those extra shifts, paid their bills on time. Folks who are raising amazing families, sending kids to college. (Applause.) Maybe he doesn't believe that people like us really exist. Because he does not see our shared humanity. And it is becoming increasingly clear that, to him, most of America is \"them.\"\nBut here's the thing: look at us. (Applause.) Just look at us. We all know better. We all know better. Whether we're Democrats, Republicans, or independents -- it does not matter. We all understand that an attack on any one of us is an attack on all of us. (Applause.) And we know that that this is not who we are. No, who are we. We are a nation founded as a rebuke to tyranny. A nation of revolutionaries who refused sovereign reign from afar. Hear me -- we're a nation that says give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free. A nation built on our differences, guided by the belief that we're all created equal. (Applause.) A nation that fully recognizes that we are always stronger together -- all of us. (Applause.) That's who we are. That's the country we want to raise our kids in.\nAnd right now, we are at a crossroads, in this election and in this country, where we're being presented with two very, very different visions for how we move forward as a nation. One candidate is offering a vision that's grounded in hopelessness and despair -- a vision of a country riven by division and ruled by fear; a country where some folks get all the breaks, and the rest of us are left behind. That's one vision of America.\nBut, fortunately, there's another candidate in this race -- (applause) -- who's offering a very different vision for this country -- and that candidate is our friend, Hillary Clinton. (Applause.) Hillary knows that our country is powerful, and vibrant, and strong. Big enough to have a place for all of us, and that each of us is a precious part of the great American story.\nHillary believes in equality; inclusion; liberty and justice for all. That each of us should have the chance to fulfill our potential and build our shared future. That is Hillary's vision for America. And Hillary doesn't just have a powerful vision for this country -- she has the policies to actually make that vision a reality. (Applause.)\nAnd isn't that what we've been looking for in this election? I can't tell you how many people have told me that they are desperate to cut through the negativity and the noise and hear what these candidates actually want to do. Well let me tell you, since the day Hillary launched her campaign, she has been laying out concrete, detailed policies that will actually make a difference in people's lives.\nLet me tell you, if you're a young person worried about affording college, Hillary has a plan to make your education tuition-free and to help folks drowning in college debt. (Applause.)\nAre you a parent who can't take a day off from work to care for a sick child or aging parent or give birth? Hillary has a plan for paid family leave that will help you. (Applause.) If you're working two, three jobs, and still struggling to get by, Hillary has a plan to raise the minimum wage. (Applause.)\nShe has a plan to improve our kids' schools, to cut taxes for working families, to fix our broken immigration system and provide a path of citizenship for millions of hardworking folks. (Applause.)\nLook, I could go on and on. All these plans are on her website -- HillaryClinton.com. She has written an entire book about what she plans to do as President. And knowing Hillary like I do, I can pretty much guarantee you that she has been personally involved in every policy that she's issued. Because here's the thing about Hillary, she is a policy wonk -- and let me tell you, just for the record, when you are President that is a good thing. (Laughter and applause.) When you are President, being able to clearly articulate detailed plans to help the people of this country is a good thing. (Applause.) Knowing what you're doing is a good thing. (Applause.)\nAnd let me tell you, Hillary Clinton absolutely knows what she's doing. Hillary has been a lawyer, a law professor, First Lady of Arkansas, First Lady of the United States, a U.S. senator, Secretary of State. Do you hear me? (Applause.)\nOver the course of her career, she has helped pass legislation to get health care for millions of our children, to support our 9/11 first responders and our National Guard and Reserves. (Applause.) She has fought for affordable child care, for equal pay for women, so much more. (Applause.)\nAnd as Secretary of State, she traveled the globe, going toe-to-toe with world leaders, keeping our country safe. (Applause.) So Hillary Clinton has more experience, more exposure to the presidency than any candidate in our lifetime. More than Barack. More than Bill. And yes, she happens to be a woman. (Applause.)\nHillary has prepared her entire career to be President. Her opponent? Well, I'll just say this: Hillary has comprehensive policies to help people -- her opponent has tweets. You decide. (Applause.)\nThe bottom line is that Hillary has done everything she's supposed to do. She has done her job. Now it's time for us to do ours and get her elected President of the United States. (Applause.)\nBecause if Hillary does not win this election, that will be on us. It will be because we didn't stand with her. It will be because we didn't volunteer for her. I got you. You win. (Applause.) And it will because we did not vote for her.\nAnd let me tell you this, that is exactly what her opponent is hoping will happen. That's the strategy -- to make this election so dirty and so ugly that we just turn off the TV and say, we just don't want any part of it.\nSo when you hear folks talking about a global conspiracy and saying this election is \"rigged\" -- understand that they are trying to get you to stay home. They are trying to convince you that your vote doesn't matter, that the outcome has already been determined, and you shouldn't even bother to make your voice heard. They are trying to take away your hope.\nAnd for the record, our democracy is revered around the world. And free elections are the best way on Earth to choose our leaders. (Applause.) This is how we elected John F. Kennedy; Ronald Reagan; two George Bushes; Bill Clinton; and Barack Obama. (Applause.) It has worked for decades.\nWe are fortunate -- and I have traveled the world, we are fortunate to live in a country where the voters decide our elections, the voters decide who wins and loses. Period. End of story. And when a presidential candidate threatens to ignore our voices and reject the outcome of this election, he is threatening the very idea of America itself -- and we cannot stand for that. (Applause.)\nYou do not keep American democracy \"in suspense.\" Because look, too many people have marched and protested and fought and died for this democracy. (Applause.) Please.\nBut here's the good news, right now folks are coming out in droves to vote early and stand up for our values. We are making our voices heard all across this country -- because when they go low --\nAUDIENCE: We go high!\nMRS. OBAMA: There you go. There you go. (Applause.)\nAnd we cannot let anyone take away our hope. We cannot let anyone silence our voices. Because we know that every vote matters -- every single vote.\nAnd if you have any doubt about that, I want you to consider back in 2012, Barack lost Arizona, this state, by 208,000 votes. That's okay. (Laughter.) But here's why I want you to think about that, because when you break that number down, the difference between winning and losing this state was only about 63 votes per precinct. Yeah. Just take that in. Sixty-three.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Arizona is going blue!\nMRS. OBAMA: Going blue. (Applause.)\nSo as you're working and going to the polls, I want you to keep that number in your mind. If 63 people in each precinct had gone the other way, Barack would have won Arizona. And this year, we know it's much closer here in this state. (Applause.)\nThat's why I'm here. So if you just look around this room, each of you has the power to swing an entire precinct and win this election for Hillary just by getting yourselves, your family, and your friends to vote. If you just take responsibility for that -- look at this room, look at how many people are here. (Applause.) You have the power. Just remember that number.\nBut you could also help swing an entire precinct for Hillary's opponent with a protest vote or by not voting at all.\nBecause here's the truth: Either Hillary Clinton or her opponent will be elected President this year. And if you vote for someone other than Hillary, or if you don't vote at all, then you are helping to elect her opponent. So I want you all to think about that for a minute. Think about how you'll feel waking up on November the 9th if that happens.\nAUDIENCE: Booo!\nMRS. OBAMA: Imagine how you'll feel if you stayed home, if you didn't do everything possible to get this done.\nSo here's what I'm asking. Don't just tweet about my speech last week. If you liked that speech, then go vote. (Applause.) If you want to stand up for yourself and your fellow Americans, then go vote. (Applause.) If you want to get Hillary elected, vote. Vote early. Vote right now. And here's the thing, I promise one of the volunteers. We need people to sign up to volunteer. This is critical. We need you all to find Hillary campaign folks who are here, sign up to make calls, knock on doors, get people to the polls on Election Day. Think about 63. If you get your 63, if you get your five, if everybody in here gets five people to the polls, that's easy. (Applause.) We can do this here! (Applause.)\nSo let me just say this, do not let yourself get tired, or frustrated, or disgusted by everything we've seen in this campaign. As you're out there working your hearts out, here's what I want you to be: Please be encouraged. Please be encouraged. If I leave you with one thing, be encouraged.\nBecause as I said, I have traveled the world. And I am telling you, we still live in the greatest country on Earth. (Applause.) I promise you that. And we have every reason to be hopeful. So be encouraged. And remember that in difficult times, we don't give up. We don't discard our highest ideals. No, we rise up to meet them. We rise up to perfect our union. We rise up to defend our blessings of liberty. We rise up to embody the unwavering hope that keeps us going -- day after day, generation after generation. That is the power of hope. (Applause.)\nDon't forget that. Hope is what drives so many people in this country. Folks like Hillary's mother who said, I may not have grown up in a loving family, but I will build a loving family of my own. I will give my children what I never had. I will pour my heart into raising a strong, smart, loving daughter. That is hope.\nHope is what drives people like my dad, who struggled to get up every day, putting in long hours -- who said, I might not have gone to college myself, but if I keep working, maybe my son, maybe my daughter will go to college. Because in this country, anything is possible. (Applause.)\nAnd hope is what drives Hillary Clinton. It is why she has spent her life fighting for kids who need a champion, families who need someone on their side. It's why she has persevered in the face of unthinkable challenges and obstacles. Because Hillary believes in the promise of our country. She believes in the talent and determination of the American people. And she shares our strong and unyielding hope -- our hope for our kids. Our hope for their future. Our hope for this country that we love so much.\nRemember that is who we are. That is who we are. And don't let anybody tell you any differently. (Applause.)\nSo here's what we need to do. We need to work our hearts out, and we need to make sure that Hillary Clinton is the next President of the United States. (Applause.) We have 19 days, 19 days. So we need to do everything in our power to help her and Tim Kaine win this election.\nSo my final question, Phoenix: Are you with me? (Applause.) Are we going to get this done? I'm counting on you. We can make this happen.\nThank you all so much. God bless.", "timestamp": "2016-10-20", "title": "Remarks by the First Lady at a Hillary for America Campaign Rally in Phoenix, Arizona"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122462", "text": "Today, President Obama will travel to Miami Dade College in Miami, Florida to deliver remarks about the progress we've made to improve our health care system, largely because of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and what more can be done to advance affordable, accessible and quality health care. He will discuss the upcoming open enrollment period for the Health Insurance Marketplace, which runs from November 1 through January 31, as well as the Administration's efforts this year to sign up young adults for coverage, who compose a disproportionate share of the remaining uninsured. Miami Dade College has served as a nationwide model for its work with its surrounding community to enroll eligible Americans in health coverage. And the President will reflect on the transformation in health care over the last seven-plus years, including system-wide reforms that are putting patients at the center of their own care and laying the foundation for a generation of medical advances.\nEight years ago, candidate Obama promised that he would make quality, affordable health care not a privilege, but a right. America was one of the last industrialized nations where this wasn't already the case. Tens of millions of Americans couldn't get health insurance, while others were forced to declare bankruptcy when they incurred crippling medical debt because of an accident or an unexpected diagnosis. High and rising health care costs placed serious burdens on our businesses, workers and economy, and threatened the future of Medicare. And our health care system too often failed to focus on patients, often waiting until Americans were sick to treat them rather than focusing on keeping them healthy.\nAfter decades of trying by presidents of both parties, President Obama made health care reform a reality. Because of the coverage expansions enacted in the ACA, an estimated 20 million adults have gained health insurance coverage as of early 2016. Children have also seen major coverage gains during this Administration, thanks in large part to the ACA and the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA). The uninsured rate among children has fallen by almost half since 2008, resulting in more than 3 million additional children having health insurance, according to a new analysis published today by the Council of Economic Advisers. The uninsured rate for people of all ages now stands at 8.6 percent, the lowest level on record.\nEven as we have achieved historic coverage gains, the outlook for health care spending has improved dramatically. Over the ACA's first decade, we are now on track to spend $2.6 trillion less than was projected without the ACA back in 2010.\nThanks in part to the ACA's focus on reducing costs and inefficiencies, health care prices have risen at the slowest rate in 50 years since the law passed, which will benefit all of us for years to come. For example, as a result of low premium growth in employer-sponsored coverage, the average premium for employer-sponsored family coverage in 2016 was nearly $3,600 lower than if premium growth since 2010 had matched the average premium growth rate recorded over the decade preceding the ACA. Slower growth compared to before the law was enacted has helped our economy, businesses, workers and state governments.\nThe ACA is significantly improving the quality of patient care throughout the health care system. For example, the law provides incentives to hospitals in Medicare to improve quality and reduce avoidable hospital readmissions. Hospital-acquired conditions have fallen since 2010, saving 87,000 lives and $20 billion in health care costs.\nThe ACA also catalyzed the development of Medicare value-based payment models aimed at transforming our health care delivery system through improved patient outcomes and reduced costs. The bipartisan Medicare physician payment reforms passed by Congress as part of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) builds on the ACA's work by focusing on the quality and efficiency of care provided to beneficiaries and creating incentives for clinicians to participate in value-based models.\nAcross the country, Administration policies have significantly improved access to health care, the affordability of care, and the quality of care since 2009. But there is more work to be done. Congress should support investments in targeted research and technologies to advance the Cancer Moonshot, the Precision Medicine Initiative, and the BRAIN Initiative. The Administration is tackling the opioid epidemic through administrative actions but also has asked Congress for $1 billion in resources for states to help people get much-needed treatment.\nIn addition, the President believes that there are common-sense ways to continue to improve the ACA. This includes working with the 19 states like Florida that have yet to expand Medicaid, taking additional actions to reduce the costs of prescription drugs, increasing financial support for people still struggling with health insurance bills, and ensuring a choice of health insurance issuers such as through a public plan fallback option. As recent experience shows, we can make a positive difference in our health system when we work together across party lines to do so.\nHealth Care in America: Improved Access to Care\n•      Millions more Americans have health insurance. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, an estimated 20 million adults have gained health insurance coverage. The ACA and CHIPRA have also helped cut the uninsured rate among children by almost half, resulting in more than 3 million additional children having health insurance coverage.\no Overall, 8.6 percent of Americans lacked health insurance in the first quarter of 2016, the lowest rate on record.\no Among African American adults, the uninsured rate declined by 53 percent (11.8 percentage points) since 2013, resulting in 3 million people gaining coverage.\no Among Latino adults, the uninsured rate dropped by 27 percent (11.3 percentage points) since 2013, resulting in 4 million people gaining coverage.\no The gains for women have been particularly rapid: the reduction in the uninsured rate since 2013 has been 13 percent larger than the reduction for men.\no Among young adults, the uninsured rate has dropped by 47 percent (12.1 percentage points) since 2013. Together with pre-2013 gains due to young adults' option to remain on a parent's plan, 6.1 million young adults have gained coverage.\no Since implementation of the Affordable Care Act, there has been a substantial reduction in the uninsured rate across all income levels, age groups, races and ethnicities, and geographic areas.\n•      The ACA prohibits coverage denials and reduced benefits based on health status, protecting as many as 129 million Americans who have some type of pre-existing health condition, including up to 19 million children.\n•      The law also eliminates lifetime and annual limits on insurance coverage and establishes annual limits on out-of-pocket spending on essential health benefits, benefiting 105 million Americans, including 39.5 million women and nearly 28 million children.\n•      The ACA provides generous federal support to states that expand Medicaid to all adults with incomes under 133 percent of the federal poverty level. In the 31 states and the District of Columbia that have already expanded Medicaid, 4.4 million uninsured people will gain coverage. If the remaining states expand Medicaid, over 4 million more uninsured people would gain coverage.\no Medicaid expansion has improved individuals' financial well-being, reducing debt in collection in states that have expanded by an estimated $600-$1,000 per individual gaining Medicaid coverage.\no Medicaid expansion also makes premiums more affordable for people who buy coverage on the individual market. Marketplace premiums are an estimated 7 percent lower in expansion states than non-expansion states.\n•      The ACA establishes a system of state and federal Health Insurance Exchanges, or Marketplaces, to make it easier for individuals and small-business employees to purchase health plans at affordable prices. During the most recent open enrollment period, 12.7 million people selected a plan through the Marketplace, and more than 400,000 people signed up for Basic Health Programs, state-based programs supported by the Affordable Care Act that provide health insurance coverage to low-income individuals who would generally otherwise be eligible to buy qualified health plans on the Marketplace.\n•      The ACA created a temporary high-risk pool program to cover uninsured people with pre-existing conditions prior to 2014 reforms, which helped more than 130,000 people.\n•      The ACA creates health plan disclosure requirements and simple, standardized summaries so over 170 million Americans can better understand coverage information and compare benefits.\nHealth Care in America: More Affordable Care\n•      The ACA's tax credits have helped millions of Americans who otherwise might not be able to afford it sign up for health coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace.\no In 2015, there were 12 million fewer Americans in families that had problems paying medical bills compared to 2011.\n•      It also requires health insurers to provide consumers with rebates if the amount they spend on health benefits and quality of care, as opposed to advertising and marketing, is too low. Last year, 5.5 million consumers received nearly $470 million in rebates. Since this requirement was put in place in 2011 through 2014, more than $2.4 billion in total refunds will have been paid to consumers.\n•      The ACA eliminates out-of-pocket costs for preventive services like immunizations, certain cancer screenings, contraception, reproductive counseling, obesity screening, and behavioral assessments for children. This coverage is guaranteed for more than 137 million Americans including 55 million women.\n•      The ACA eliminates out-of-pocket costs for 39 million Medicare beneficiaries for preventive services like cancer screenings, bone-mass measurements, annual physicals, and smoking cessation.\n•      It phases out the \"donut hole\" coverage gap for over 11 million Medicare prescription drug beneficiaries, who have saved an average of more than $2,000 per beneficiary through July 2016.\n•      The ACA takes steps to slow the growth of health care spending.\no Relative to the projections the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) issued just before President Obama took office, CBO now projects Medicare to spend 20 percent, or about $160 billion, less in 2019 alone.\no Medicare's Trustees project that the program's hospital insurance trust fund will remain solvent until 2028, 11 years later than the last projection before the ACA became law.\no The nation as a whole is projected to spend $2.6 trillion less on health care over the ACA's first decade than was predicted prior to the ACA's enactment.[1]\n•      The law creates Accountable Care Organizations consisting of doctors and other health-care providers who come together to provide coordinated, high-quality care at lower costs to their Medicare patients. Over 470 ACOs are serving nearly 8.9 million Medicare beneficiaries nationwide.\n•      And it pays Medicare Advantage plans more accurately, and requires Medicare Advantage plans to spend at least 85 percent of Medicare revenue on patient care. Medicare Advantage enrollment is projected to have grown over 60 percent from 2010 through 2017 to 18.5 million, while premiums are projected to decline by 13 percent.\nHealth Care in America: Improved Quality and Accountability to You\n•      The ACA provides incentives to hospitals in Medicare to reduce hospital-acquired infections and avoidable readmissions. Hospital-acquired conditions have fallen 17 percent since 2010, saving 87,000 lives and $20 billion in health care costs, and the rate of one common deadly hospital acquired infection, central-line blood stream infections, fell by 50 percent from 2008 to 2014 nationwide.\nWe're not done. Other legislative and executive actions are continuing to advance the cause of effective, accountable and affordable health care. This includes:\n•      Advancing innovative care delivery models and value-based payments in Medicare and Medicaid. The Administration set goals of tying 30 percent of traditional Medicare payments to alternative payment models by the end of 2016 and 50 percent by the end of 2018, and met its 2016 goal 11 months early. We continue to advance new models for value-based payments in Medicare and implement bipartisan Medicare physician payment reforms.\n•      Implementing the funding pool created by the ACA for Community Health Centers to build, expand and operate health-care facilities in underserved communities. Since the beginning of 2009, thanks to this and other investments, health centers have increased the number of patients served by 6 million.\n•      Expanding health provider training opportunities, with an emphasis on primary care, including a significant expansion of the National Health Service Corps. As of September 30, 2015, there were 9,600 Corps clinicians providing primary care services, over twice the number of clinicians in 2008 (3,600).\n###\n[1] Updated national health expenditure projections published this summer estimated that the United States would spend a total of $31.8 trillion on health care over the 2010-2019 period.

Hello, hello, hello! Hello, Miami! Thank you so much. Well, everybody, have a seat, have a seat. It is good to see all of you! It's good to be back at Miami Dade, one of my favorite institutions! Love this school.\nI want to thank your longtime president and great friend, Eduardo J. Padrón, and to all the faculty and staff and, of course, most importantly, the students, for hosting me. I want to say how grateful I am. I want to thank the wonderful elected officials who are here today. I'm going to just point out two outstanding Members of Congress: Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Ted Deutch.\nSo this is one of my last visits here as President. Now, once I'm not President——\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. No, no, the good news is, once I'm no longer President, I can come more often. Right now, usually, I can only come to Florida when I'm working. [Laughter] But when I'm out of office, I can come here for fun. [Laughter]\nBut the first thing I want to say is thank you for your support and thank you for the opportunity and the privilege you've given me to serve these past 8 years. I remember standing just a few blocks north of here in the closing days of the 2008 campaign. And at that point, we were already realizing that we were in the midst of the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes. We didn't know where the bottom would be. We were still in the middle of two wars. Over 150,000 of our troops were overseas. But thanks to the hard work and the determination of the American people, when I come here today, the story is different.\nWorking together, we've cut the unemployment rate in Florida by more than half. Across the country, we turned years of job losses into the longest streak of job creation on record. We slashed our dependence on foreign oil, doubled our production of renewable energy. Incomes are rising again; they rose more last year than any time ever recorded. Poverty is falling; fell more last year than any time since 1968. Our graduation rates from high school are at record highs. College enrollment is significantly higher than it was when we came into office. Marriage equality is a reality in all 50 States.\nSo we've been busy. This is why I've got gray hair. [Laughter] But we did one other thing. We fought to make sure that in America, health care is not just a privilege, but a right for every single American. And that's what I want to talk about today. [Applause] That's what I want to talk about here today.\nYou've heard a lot about Obamacare, as it's come to be known. [Laughter] You've heard a lot about it in the 6½ years since I signed it into law. And some of the things you've heard might even be true. But one thing I want to start with is just reminding people why it is that we fought for health reform in the first place. Because it was one of the key motivators in my campaign.\nAnd it wasn't just because rising health costs were eating into workers' paychecks and straining budgets for businesses and for governments. It wasn't just because before the law was passed, insurance companies could just drop your coverage because you got sick, right at the time where you needed insurance most.\nIt was because of you. It was because of the stories that I was hearing all around the country and right here in Florida, hearing from people who had been forced to fight a broken health care system at the same time as they were fighting to get well.\nIt was about children like Zoe Lihn, who needed heart surgery when she was just 15 hours old, just a baby, just a infant. And she was already halfway to hitting her lifetime insurance cap before she was old enough to walk. Her parents had no idea how they could possibly make sure that she continued to make progress. And today, because of the Affordable Care Act, Zoe is in first grade, and she's loving martial arts. And she's got a bright future ahead of her.\nWe fought so hard for health reform because of women like Amanda Heidel, who lives here in South Florida. As a girl, she was diagnosed with diabetes, and that's a disease with costs that can add up quickly if you don't have insurance, can eat away at your dreams. But thanks to the Affordable Care Act, Amanda got to stay on her parents' plan after college. When she turned 26, Amanda went online. She stopped—shopped for an affordable health insurance plan that covered her medications. Today, she's pursuing a doctorate in psychology.\nAnd Amanda said that the Affordable Care Act \"has given me the security and freedom to choose how I live my life.\" The freedom and security to choose how I live my life. That's what this was all about: Zoe and Amanda, the people who I get letters from every single day describing what it meant not to fear that if they got sick or a member of their family got sick, if they, heaven forbid, were in an accident, that somehow they could lose everything.\nSo because of this law, because of Obamacare, another 20 million Americans now know the financial security of health insurance. So do another 3 million children, thanks in large part to the Affordable Care Act and the improvements, the enhancements that we made to the Children's Health Insurance Program. And the net result is that never in American history has the uninsured rate been lower than it is today. Never. And that's true across the board. It's dropped among women. It's dropped among Latinos and African Americans, every other demographic group. It's worked.\nNow, that doesn't mean that it's perfect. No law is. And it's true that a lot of the noise around the health care debate, ever since we tried to pass this law, has been nothing more than politics. But we've also always known—and I have always said—that for all the good that the Affordable Care Act is doing right now, for as big a step forward as it was, it's still just a first step. It's like building a starter home—or buying a starter home. It's a lot better than not having a home—[laughter]—but you hope that over time you make some improvements.\nAnd in fact, since we first signed the law, we've already taken a number of steps to improve it. And we can do even more, but only if we put aside all the political rhetoric, all the partisanship, and just be honest about what's working, what needs fixing, and how we fix it.\nSo that's what I want to do today. This isn't, kind of, a rah-rah speech. [Laughter] I might get into the details. I hope you don't mind. [Laughter]\nSo let's start with a basic fact. The majority of Americans do not—let me repeat—do not get health care through the Affordable Care Act. Eighty percent or so of Americans get health care on the job through their employer. Or they get health care through Medicaid or they get health care through Medicare. And so for most Americans, the Affordable Care Act, Obama has not affected your coverage, except to make it stronger. Because of the law, you now have free preventive care; insurance companies have to offer that in whatever policy they sell. Because of the law, you now have free checkups for women. Because of the law, you get free mammograms. Because of the law, it is harder for insurance companies to discriminate against you because you're a woman when you get health insurance. Because of the law, doctors are finding better ways to perform heart surgeries and delivering healthier babies and treating chronic disease and reducing the number of people that, once they're in the hospital, end up having to return to the hospital. So you're getting better quality even though you don't know that Obamacare is doing it. [Laughter]\nAudience member. Thanks, Obama.\nThe President. Thanks, Obama.\nBecause of the law, your annual out-of-pocket spending is capped. Seniors get discounts on their prescription drugs because of the law. Young people can stay on their parents' plan, just like Amanda did, because of the law. And Amanda was able to stay on her parents' plan and then get insurance after she aged out, even though she has what used to be called a preexisting condition, because we made it illegal to discriminate against people with preexisting conditions.\nBy the way, before this law, before Obamacare, health insurance rates for everybody—whether you got your insurance on the job or you were buying it on your own—health insurance rates generally were going up really fast. This law has actually slowed down the pace of health care inflation. So every year, premiums have gone up, but they've gone up the slowest in 50 years since Obamacare was passed. In fact, if your family gets insurance through your job, your family is paying, on average, about $3,600 less per year than you would be if the cost trends that had existed before the law were passed had continued. Think about that. That's money in your pocket.\nNow, some people may say, \"Well, I've seen my copays go up\" or \"My networks have changed.\" But these are decisions that are made by your employers. It's not because of Obamacare. They're not determined by the Affordable Care Act.\nSo if the Affordable Care Act, if Obamacare hasn't changed the coverage of the 80 percent of Americans who already had insurance, except to make it a better value, except to make it more reliable, how has the law impacted the other 15 or 20 percent of Americans who didn't have health insurance through their job or didn't qualify for Medicaid or didn't qualify for Medicare?\nWell, before the Affordable Care Act, frankly, you were probably out of luck. Either you had to buy health insurance on your own because you weren't getting it through the job and it was wildly expensive and your premiums were going up all the time, and if you happened to get sick and use the insurance, the insurer, the next year, could drop you. And if you had had an illness like cancer or diabetes or some other chronic disease, you couldn't buy a new insurance because the insurance company's attitude was: \"You know what, this is just going to cost us money. We don't want to insure you.\"\nSo if you were buying—trying to buy health insurance on your own, it was either hugely expensive or didn't provide very effective coverage. You might buy a policy thinking that it was going to cover you. And it was sort of like when I was young and I bought my first car. I had to buy health—I had to buy car insurance and I won't name the insurance company, but I bought the insurance because it was the law, and I got the cheapest one I could get because I didn't have any money and it was a really beat-up car. [Laughter] And I remember, somebody rear ends me, and I call up the insurance company thinking maybe I can get some help, and they laughed at me. They're all, like, what, are you kidding? [Laughter] It didn't provide any coverage other than essentially allowing me to drive. [Laughter]\nWell, that's what it was like for a lot of people who didn't have health insurance on the job. So that meant that a lot of people just didn't bother getting health insurance at all. And when they got sick, they'd go—have to go to the emergency room.\nAudience member. Or if you got pregnant.\nThe President. Well, that's true too. [Laughter]\nAnd so you're relying on the emergency room, but the emergency room is the most expensive place to get care. And because you weren't insured, the hospital would have to give you the care for free, and they would have to then make up for those costs by charging everybody else more money. So it wasn't good for anybody.\nSo what the Affordable Care Act is designed to do is to help those people who were previously either uninsured or underinsured. And it worked to help those people in two ways.\nFirst, we gave States funding to expand Medicaid to cover more people. In DC and the 31 States that took us up on that, more than 4 million people have coverage who didn't have it before. They now have health insurance.\nSecond, for people who made too much to qualify for Medicaid even after we expanded it, we set up what we call marketplaces on healthcare.gov so you could shop for a plan that fits your needs, and then we would give you tax credits to help you buy it. And most people today can find a plan for less than $75 a month at the healthcare.gov marketplace when you include the tax credits that Government is giving you. That means it's less than your cell phone bill, because I know you guys are tweeting a lot—[laughter]—and texting and selfies. [Laughter] And the good news is that most people who end up buying their coverage through the marketplaces using these tax credits are satisfied with their plans.\nSo not only did Obamacare do a lot of good for the 80-plus percent of Americans who already had health care, but now it gave a new affordable option to a lot of folks who never had options before. All told, about another 10 percent of the country now have coverage. The Affordable Care Act has done what it was designed to do: It gave us affordable health care.\nSo what's the problem? Why is there still such a fuss? [Laughter] Well, part of the problem is the fact that a Democratic President named Barack Obama passed the law. And that's just the truth. [Laughter] I mean, I worked really, really hard to engage Republicans; took Republican ideas that originally they had praised, said, \"Let's work together to get this done.\" And when they just refused to do anything, we said, all right, we're going to have to do it with Democrats. And that's what we did.\nAnd early on, Republicans just decided to oppose it, and then they tried to scare people with all kinds of predictions: that it would be a job killer, that it would force everyone into Government-run insurance, that it would lead to rationing, that it would lead to death panels—[laughter]—that it would bankrupt the Federal Government. You remember all this. And despite the fact that all the bad things they predicted have not actually happened; despite the fact that we've created more jobs since the bill passed than—in consecutive months than any time on record; despite the fact that the uninsured rate has gone down to its lowest levels ever; despite the fact that it's actually cost less than anybody anticipated and has shown to be much less disruptive on existing plans that people get through their employers; despite the fact that it saved Medicare over $150 billion, which makes that program more secure—despite all this, it's been hard, if not impossible, for any Republican to admit it.\nThey just can't admit that a lot of good things have happened and the bad things they predicted didn't happen. So they just keep on repeating, we're going to repeal it. We're going to repeal it, and we're going to replace it with something better, even though, 6½ years later, they haven't. They still haven't shown us what it is that they would do that would be better.\nBut—and this is actually the main reason I'm here—just because a lot of the Republican criticism has proven to be false and politically motivated doesn't mean that there aren't some legitimate concerns about how the law is working now. And the main issue has to do with the folks who still aren't getting enough help. Remember, I said 80 percent of people, even before the law passed, already had health insurance. And then, we expanded Medicaid and we set up the marketplaces, and another 10 percent of people got health insurance. Well, but that still leaves that last 10 percent. And the fact that, that last 10 percent still has difficulties is something that we've got to do something about.\nNow, part of the reason for this is, as I already mentioned to you, not every State expanded Medicaid to its citizens, which means that some of the most vulnerable working families that the law was designed to help still haven't gotten insurance. As you may have heard, Florida is one of those States. [Laughter] If your Governor could put politics aside——\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. Don't boo, vote.\nIf your Governor would just put politics aside and do what's right, then more than 700,000 Floridians would suddenly have access to coverage. And by the way, that would hold down costs for the rest of you because there'd be less uncompensated care in hospitals. And it means that people who did sign up for the marketplace, who oftentimes may be sicker qualify for Medicaid, and so they're not raising costs in the marketplace.\nIn fact, if the 19 States who so far have not expanded Medicaid would just do so, another 4 million people would have coverage right now all across the country.\nSo that's step number one. And that's, by the way, just completely in the control of these Governors. They could be doing it right now. They could do it tomorrow.\nNow, the second issue has to do with the marketplaces. Although the marketplaces are working well in most of the States, there are some States where there's still not enough competition between insurers. So if you only have one insurer, they may decide we're going to jack up rates because we can, because nobody else is offering a better price.\nIn those States where the Governor or legislature is hostile to the ACA, it makes it harder to enroll people because the State is not actively participating in outreach. And so, as a consequence, in those States, enrollment in the plan—especially enrollment of young people—has lagged.\nAnd what that means is that the insurance pool is smaller, and it gets a higher percentage of older and sicker people who are signing up. Because if you're sick or you're old, you're more likely to say, well, I'm going to sign up, no matter what, because I know I'm going to need it. If you're young and healthy, like you guys, you say: \"Eh, I'm fine. Life's good.\" So you have more older and sicker people signing up, fewer younger and healthier people signing up, and that drives rates up, right? Because the people who use health care most end up being in the insurance pool; people who use it least are not.\nAnd then, in some cases, insurers just set their prices too low at the outset because they didn't know what the insurance pool was going to look like, and then they started losing money. And so now they've decided to significantly increase premiums in some States.\nNow, it's these premium increases in some of the States in the marketplace that sometimes attracts negative headlines. Remember, these premium increases won't impact most of the people who are buying insurance through the marketplace because even when premiums go up, the tax credits go up to offset the increases. So people who qualify for tax credits, they may not even notice their premiums went up because the tax credit cover it.\nAnd keep in mind that these premium increases that some of you may have read about have no effect at all if you're getting health insurance on the job or through Medicaid or Medicare. So for the 80 [percent]*-plus people who already had health insurance, if your premium is going up, it's not because of Obamacare. It's because of your employer or your insurer even though, sometimes, they try to blame Obamacare—[laughter]—for why the rates go up. It's not because of any policy of the Affordable Care Act that the rates are going up.\nBut if you are one of the people who doesn't get health care on the job, doesn't qualify for Medicaid, doesn't qualify for Medicare, doesn't qualify for a tax credit to help you buy insurance because maybe you made just a little bit too much money under the law, these premium increases do make insurance less affordable. And in some States, the premium increases are manageable. Some are 2 percent or 8 percent, some 20 percent. But we know there are some States that may see premiums go up by 50 percent or more.\nAnd an extreme example is Arizona, where we expect benchmark premiums will more than double. Now, part of this is because Arizona is one of those States that had really low average premiums, among the lowest in the country. So now insurance companies basically are trying to catch up, and they also don't have a lot of competition there. And meanwhile, in States like Florida, the failure to expand Medicaid contributes to higher marketplace premiums. And then, there are some other States that just because of the nature of their health care systems or the fact that they're rural and people are dispersed—so it's harder to provide health care, more expensive—they have a tougher time controlling costs generally.\nAgain, the tax credits in the ACA will protect most consumers from the brunt of these premium increases. And with the ability to shop around on healthcare.gov, which works really well now—[laughter]—most people can find plans for prices even lower than this year's prices. But there are going to be people who are hurt by premium increases or a lack of competition and choice. And I don't want to see anybody left out without health insurance. I don't want to see any family having to choose between health insurance now or saving for retirement or saving for their kids' college education or just paying their own bills.\nSo the question we should be asking is, what do we do about these growing pains in the Affordable Care Act, and how do we get the last 9 percent of Americans covered? How do we reach those last 9 percent? And how do we make sure that premiums are more stable going forward and the marketplace insurance pools are more stable going forward? Well, I can tell you what will not work: Repealing the Affordable Care Act will not work. That's a bad idea. That will not solve the problem, because right off the bat, repeal would take away health care from 20 million people. We'd go back where 80 percent of people had health insurance instead of 90 percent, right off the bat. And all the reforms that everybody benefits from that I talked about like young Americans being able to stay on their parents' plans or the rules that prevent insurance companies from discriminating against people because of a preexisting condition like diabetes or cancer or the rule now that you can't charge somebody more just because they're a woman—all those reforms would go away for everybody, because that's part of Obamacare.\nAll the progress that we've made in controlling costs and improving how health care is delivered, progress that's helped hold growth in the price of health care to the slowest rate in 50 years, all that goes away. That's what repeal means. It would be bad for everybody. And the majority of Americans, even if they don't know that they're benefiting from Obamacare, don't want to see these benefits and protections taken away from their families now that they have them. I guarantee you, there are people who right now think they hate Obamacare. And if somebody told them, all right, we're repealing it, but now your kid who is on your plan is no longer on your plan or now you've got a preexisting condition and you can't buy health insurance, they'd be shocked. They'd be, \"What do you mean?\" [Laughter]\nSo repeal is not the answer. Here is what we can do instead to actually make the Affordable Care Act work even better than it's working right now. And I've already mentioned one. Florida and every State should expand Medicaid. Cover more people. It's easy to do, and it could be done right now. You'd cover 4 million more Americans, help drive down premiums for folks who buy insurance through the marketplace. And by the way, because the Federal Government pays for almost all of this expansion, you can't use as an excuse that, \"Well, the State can't afford it\" because the Federal Government is paying it. States like Louisiana that just expanded Medicaid. You had a Republican Governor replaced by a Democratic Governor. He said, \"I want that money.\" Expanded Medicaid and found not only does it insure more people, but it's actually saved the State big money and makes people less dependent on expensive emergency room care. So that's step number one.\nStep number two: Since overall health care costs have turned out to be significantly lower than everyone expected since we passed Obamacare, since that's saved the Federal Government billions of dollars, we should use some of that money, some of those savings to now provide more tax credits for more middle-income families, for more young adults, to help them buy insurance. It will make their premiums more affordable. And that's not just good for them, it's good for everybody. Because when more people are in the marketplace, everybody will benefit from lower premiums. Healthier people, younger people start joining the pool, premiums generally go down. That'd be number two.\nThe third thing we should do is add what's called a public plan fallback to give folks more options in those places where there are just not enough insurers to compete. And that's especially important in some rural communities and rural States and counties. If you live in L.A. right now, then it's working fine. There are a lot of insurers because it's a big market. There are a lot of providers. But if you're in some remote areas or you're in some small towns, it may be that the economics of it just don't work unless the Government is providing an option to make it affordable. And by the way, this is not complicated. Basically, you would just wait and see. If the private insurers are competing for business, then you don't have to trigger a public option. But if no private insurers are providing affordable insurance in an area, then the Government would step in with a quality plan that people can afford.\nAnd by the way, this is not a radical idea. This idea is modeled on something that Republicans championed under George Bush for the Medicare Part D drug benefit program. It was fine when it was their idea. [Laughter] The fact that they're now opposed to it as some socialist scheme is not being consistent. It's being partisan.\nAnd finally, we should continue to encourage innovation by the States. What the Affordable Care Act says is, here's how we propose you insure your populations, but if you, the State, can figure out a different way to accomplish the same goal—providing affordable, comprehensive coverage for the same number of residents at the same costs—then go right ahead. There may be more than one way to skin a cat. Maybe you've got an idea we haven't thought of. Just show us, don't talk about it. Show us what the plan looks like.\nRepublicans who claim to care about your health insurance choices and your premiums, but then offer nothing and block commonsense solutions like the ones that I propose to improve them, that's not right. And my message to them has been and will continue to be: Work with us. Make the system better. Help the people you serve. We're open to good ideas, but they've got to be real ideas, not just slogans—[laughter]—not just votes to repeal. And they've got to pass basic muster. You can't say, well, if we just do—if we just plant some magic beans—[laughter]—then everybody will have health insurance. No, we've got to have health care economists and experts look at it and see if the thing would actually work.\nSo that's where we are. Number one, Obamacare is helping millions of people right now. The uninsured rate has never been lower. It's helping everybody who already has health insurance because it makes their policies better. Number two, there are still too many hard-working people who are not being reached by the law. Number three, if we tweak the program to reach those people who are not currently benefiting from the law, it will be good for them, and it will be good for the country. Number four, if we repeal this law wholesale, that will hurt the people who don't have coverage right now. It will hurt the 20 million who are already getting help through the law, and it will help—it will hurt the country as a whole.\nSo this should be an easy choice. All it does—all it requires is putting aside ideology and, in good faith, trying to implement the law of the land. And what we've learned, by the way, is that when Governors and State legislatures expand Medicaid for their citizens and they hold insurance companies accountable, and they're honest with uninsured people about their options, and they're working with us on outreach, then the marketplace works the way it's supposed to. And when they don't, the marketplaces tend to have more problems. And that shouldn't be surprising. If State leaders purposely try to make something not work, then it's not going to run as smoothly as if they were trying to make it work. Common sense. You don't even have to go to Miami Dade to figure that out. [Laughter]\nAudience member. Thank slick Rick. [Laughter]\nThe point is, now is not the time to move backwards on health care reform, now is the time to move forward. The problems that may have arisen from the Affordable Care Act is not because Government's too involved in the process. The problem is, is that we have not reached everybody and pulled them in. And think about it. When one of these companies comes out with a new smartphone and it had a few bugs, what do they do? They fix it. They upgrade it—unless it catches fire, and they just—[laughter]—then they pull it off the market. But you don't go back to using a rotary phone. [Laughter] You don't say, well, we're repealing smartphones. We're just going to do the dial-up thing. [Laughter] That's not what you do.\nWell, the same basic principle applies here. We're not going to go back to discriminating against Americans with preexisting conditions. We're not going to go back to a time when people's coverage was dropped when they got sick. We're not going to go back to a situation where we're reinstating lifetime limits in the fine print so that you think you have insurance and then you get really sick or you kid gets really sick and you hit the limit that the insurance company set and, next thing you know, they're not covering you anymore and you've got to figure out how you come up with another $100,000 or $200,000 to make sure that your child lives. We're not going to go back to that.\nI hear Republicans in Congress object, and they'll say, no, no, no, we'll keep those parts of Obamacare that are popular; we'll just repeal everything else. Well, it turns out that the sum of those parts that are popular in Obamacare is Obamacare. It's just, people don't always know it. And repealing it would make the majority of Americans worse off when it comes to health care.\nAnd as I said, part of this is just, you know, health care is complicated. Think about this speech. It's been pretty long, and you're just—you're thinking, wow, I just want to take a picture with the President or something. [Laughter] So it's hard to get people focused on the facts. And even reporters who have covered this stuff—and they do a good job. They're trying to follow all the debate. But a lot of times they just report, \"Premium increases.\" And everybody thinks, wow, my insurance rates are going up, it must be Obama's fault—[laughter]—even though you don't get health insurance through Obamacare, you get it through your job and even though your increases have gone up a lot slower. Or suddenly, you're paying a bigger copay, and, ah, thanks Obama. [Laughter] And it's—well, no, I had nothing to do with that. [Laughter]\nSo part of it is, this is complicated the way it gets reported. There's a lot of hysteria around anything that happens. And what we need to do is just focus on this very specific problem: How do we make sure that more people are getting coverage? And folks right now who are not getting tax credits, aren't getting Medicaid, how do we help them? How do we reach them? And we can do it.\nInstead of repealing the law, I believe the next President and the next Congress should take what we've learned over the past 6 years and in a serious way analyze it, figure out what it is that needs to get done, and make the Affordable Care Act better and cover even more people. But understand, no President can do it alone. We will need Republicans in Congress and in State governments to act responsibly and put politics aside, because I want to remind, you a lot of the Affordable Care Act is built on Republican ideas.\nIn fact, Bernie Sanders is still mad at me because we didn't get single-payer passed. Now, we couldn't get single-payer passed, and I wanted to make sure that we helped as many people as possible given the political constraints. And so we adopted a system that Republicans should like; it's based on a competitive, market-based system in which people have a responsibility for themselves to buy insurance.\nAnd maybe now that I'm leaving office, maybe Republicans can stop with the 60-something repeal votes they've taken—[laughter]—and stop pretending that they have a serious alternative and stop pretending that all the terrible things they said would happen have actually happened when they have not and just work with the next President to smooth out the kinks. Because it turns out, no major social innovation in America has ever worked perfectly at the start. Social Security didn't. Its benefits were stingy at first. It left out a whole lot of Americans. The same was true for Medicare. The same was true for Medicaid. The same was true for the prescription drug law. But what happened was, each year, people of good will from both parties tried to make it better. And that's what we need to do right now.\nAnd I promise, if Republicans have good ideas to provide more coverage for folks like Amanda, I will be all for it. I don't care whose idea it is, I just want it to work. They can even change the name of the law to Reagan Care—[laughter]—or they can call it Paul Ryan Care. I don't care—[laughter]—about credit. I just want it to work because I care about the American people and making sure they've got health insurance. [Laughter]\nBut that brings me to my final point, and that is, change does not typically come from the top down, it always comes from the bottom up. The Affordable Care Act was passed because the American people mobilized, not just to get me elected, but to keep the pressure on me to actually do something about health care and to put pressure on Members of Congress to do something about it. And that's how change happens in America. It doesn't happen on its own. It doesn't happen from on high. It happens from the bottom up. And breaking gridlock will come only when the American people demand it.\nSo that's why I'm here. Only you can break this stalemate by educating the public on the benefits of the Affordable Care Act and then pressing your elected officials to do the right thing and supporting elected officials who have—are doing the right thing.\nAnd this is one of the reasons why I'm so proud of what Miami Dade College is doing, because it's making sure that students and faculty and people throughout this community know about the law, know about how to sign up for health care, and then actually helps people sign up. And I'm incredibly proud of the leadership of Joe Peña and the entire team in encouraging people to sign up.\nThanks to them, Miami Dade has been hosting enrollment office hours and workshops, even on nights and weekends. Right here on the Wolfson campus and on all the Miami Dade campuses, you can go for a free one-on-one session, where a trained expert can walk you through the process and answer any questions you have and then help you sign up for health care right there and then. Joe says he doesn't have a conversation without making sure people know how to get covered. The more young and healthy people like you who do the smart thing and sign up, then the better it's going to work for everybody.\nAnd the good news is, in a few days, you can do just that because open enrollment, the time when you can start signing up, begins on November 1. And you just need to go to healthcare.gov, which works really well now. [Laughter]\nAnd campuses will be competing to come up with the most creative ways to reach people and get them signed up. And I'm pretty sure that Miami Dade can set the standard for the rest of the country, because that's how you do. [Applause] That's how you do.\nSo much has changed since I campaigned here in Miami eight Octobers ago. But one thing has not: This is more than just about health care. It's about the character of our country. It's about whether we look out for one another. It's about whether the wealthiest nation on Earth is going to make sure that nobody suffers, nobody loses everything they've saved, everything they've worked for because they're sick. You stood up for the idea that no American should have to go without the health care they need. And it's still true today. And we've proven together that people who love this country can change it. Twenty million people out there will testify. I get letters every day just saying thank you because it's made a difference in their lives. And what was true then is true now. We still need you. Our work to expand opportunity to all and to make our Union more perfect is never finished, but the more we work and organize and advocate and fight, the closer we get.\nSo I hope you're going to be busy this November signing folks up. But more importantly, I hope for all the young people here, you never stop working for a better America. And even though I won't be President, I'll keep working right alongside you.\nThank you, everybody. God bless you. God bless America. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2016-10-20", "title": "Remarks on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in Miami, Florida"}

Hello, Miami Gardens! How's everybody doing today? Can everybody please give a big round of applause to Dominique? We are so proud of her. Thank you, Florida Memorial University. Go Lions! It's good to be here.\nAudience member. We love you, Obama!\nThe President. Love you back. Well, I love you back, you know that. You know who else I love? We've got a bunch of elected officials here today, including some of your outstanding Representatives: Frederica Wilson is in the house; and your next United States Senator, Patrick Murphy.\nSo if you have a seat, feel free to sit down. If you don't have a seat, don't. Just make yourself comfortable, because I've got some things to say here.\nSo this will be probably one of my last visits to Miami as President.\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. No, no, don't worry. Don't worry. I'm going to come back, but I won't be President, so I can have more fun. But this is how things work in a democracy. I'll talk about that later too: how things are supposed to work in a democracy. Michelle and I only get an 8-year lease on the White House. We rent, we don't own. And right now we're making sure we haven't broken anything; that Bo and Sunny haven't ruined any carpets. [Laughter] We have been marking off how tall Malia and Sasha were getting on the wall, but now we've got to erase it. [Laughter] Because we want our security deposit back. But obviously, it has been one of the great honors of my life—the great honor of my life—to serve the American people.\nAnd look, the truth is, I couldn't have done it without Florida. Florida has always been good to us. I remember campaigning here in Miami in the closing days of a tough campaign 8 years ago. And we had been living through two long wars. We were about to enter into the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes. On issues like health care and issues like climate change, we hadn't really been doing anything. We had just been kicking the can down the road. And I told you then, when I was campaigning, I told you I wasn't a perfect man and I wasn't going to be a perfect President. But I told you I would work as hard as I could every single day on your behalf; that I would fight for you to make life a little bit easier for working families all across this country.\nAnd I tell you what, 8 years later, we can look back, and we can say we fought our way back from a recession. Our businesses have turned job losses into 15 million new jobs. We have slashed our dependence on foreign oil. We've doubled our production of clean energy. Incomes are rising; poverty is falling. The uninsured rate is at an alltime low. We've brought our brave troops home to their families. We delivered justice to Usama bin Laden. Marriage equality is a reality in all 50 States. We've been busy these last 8 years.\nBy every measure, our country is stronger and more prosperous than when I came into office. But all that progress is at stake if we don't do the right thing these next 19 days. I know there are some folks who are talking about how terrible America is. But you know what, I've been to all 50 States as your President, and I see how great America is right now. I see folks working hard, starting their own businesses. I see teachers reaching into their own pocket to make sure our kids are getting the education that they need. I see doctors serving the poor and coming up with new cures. I see our men and women in uniform, our cops and first responders, running towards danger, working to keep us safe.\nI see the patriotism of young activists who are troubled when things don't go the way they should and call on us to live up to our highest ideals. I see all of you—Americans of every faith and every race and every region of the country—who know that we're stronger together. Young and old, men and women, Black, White, Latino, Asian, Native American, people with disabilities or not—all pledging allegiance to the red and white and blue. That's what I see about America. That's the America I know!\nThat is the America I know. And there is only one candidate in this race who has devoted her life to that better America: the next President of the United States, Hillary Clinton!\nNow—[applause]. Hold on, hold on, hold on. See, that's one of the things I love about Florida: This is always a rowdy crowd. Here's the good news. You don't have to wait until November 8 to send Hillary to the White House. You don't need to wait until November 8 to send Patrick Murphy to the United States Senate. You can vote early starting this Monday.\nYou can find out where to vote at iwillvote.com. Starting on Monday, you can go to the polls. And when you vote early, it's not crowded. When you vote early, there are no lines. When you vote early, you can, kind of, do it on your lunch break. You can do it at your own leisure. You can take your time.\nBut starting Monday, you can reject somebody who proves himself unfit to be President every single day in every single way. You can reject his dark, pessimistic, fear-mongering vision of a country, where we turn against each other and turn away from our role in the world.\nAnd instead, you can choose as qualified a person who has ever run to lead this country. You can affirm the America we know, a country full of optimism and courage and generosity and hope; a country where we look out for each other and don't turn on each other. That's the choice that you can make, starting on Monday, right here in South Florida.\nNow, I've said this before. There's nothing that can completely prepare you for the job of being President of the United States. You know, that first day after you get sworn in, and they walk you in the office, then everybody leaves, and you're in the office, and you're looking around thinking, man, now what? [Laughter]\nBut here's the thing. Hillary Clinton, she's been a First Lady. She's been a Senator. She's been my Secretary of State. She's been in the room when tough decisions were made. She knows how those decisions can affect a veteran or a soldier or a kid who needs a great education or a worker who is fighting for a good job or a raise or a decent retirement. And I will tell you, even in the middle of crisis, she is calm and cool and collected. And she's listening to people, and she's treating everybody with respect.\nAnd here's the thing about Hillary: No matter how tough the odds, no matter how much people try to knock her down, no matter how mean folks can be, she doesn't point fingers. She doesn't complain. She doesn't whine. [Laughter] She just works harder, and she gets the job done. And she never, ever, ever quits. And that's why I know she can be a great President of the United States of America. And the other thing is, she actually knows what she's talking about. [Laughter] She's actually done her homework. So she's got real plans to address what she's heard from you: specific ideas to invest in new jobs, to help workers share in company's profits, to reduce inequality; ideas to help kids have access to preschool and help students go through college without taking on a ton of debt. She was just here in Miami last week talking about what she was going to do to fight climate change. And then, she proposed a child tax credit that would help millions of families.\nI mean, she loves this stuff. She's all—she's just reading her briefing book all the time. She's not watching TV. She's not watching the reality TV. She's not participating in reality TV. She's doing the work, and that's what you want from a President of the United States of America.\nNow, she is not going to be able to do it alone. So we also have to have outstanding Members of Congress. And Patrick Murphy, when he's your United States Senator, he's going to be doing his work. In fact, unlike his opponent, he actually shows up to work. Unlike his opponent, he didn't try to defund Planned Parenthood. He made sure that women could make their own health care decisions.\nUnlike his opponent, he didn't walk away from Florida's Hispanic community when the politics got tough. He fought for comprehensive immigration reform and a pathway to citizenship. Unlike his opponent, Patrick actually believes in science and believes in the effects of climate change. Just the other night in their debate, Marco Rubio did not accept that sea levels are rising. And if you're watching TV or you are going down some of the blocks right here in Miami in the middle of a sunny day and you see the ocean coming up through the streets, how can you deny what is right in front of you? I thought he was from Miami.\nPatrick Murphy brought Democrats and Republicans together to fund Everglades restoration. He knows how to get stuff done, not just think about what you're going to do next. And as your next Senator, he'll fight for this planet for future generations.\nThe point is, you deserve leaders who show up to work, who do their homework, to—who care more about you than just hanging on to their job, who will have your back. That is who Hillary Clinton is. That's who Patrick Murphy is. They will always be there for you. And that's why you've got to be there for them, starting Monday when you go early vote.\nAnd in contrast, you've got Donald Trump.\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. Oh! Don't boo, vote! Vote! Booing doesn't do any good. [Laughter] Vote! And get your friends to vote. Get Uncle Joe to vote. Get Pookie to vote and Javier to vote. Vote, don't boo. Trump can't hear you from here. But he can hear you when you go to the ballot box and vote.\nI know Trump hangs around here in Florida, but I don't think he represents the values of Florida.\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. Here's a guy who repeatedly stiffs small-business owners and workers who have done work for him. In fact, he thinks that's smart; just don't pay them and then let them try to sue. This is a guy who doesn't release his tax returns. First President—first Presidential candidate in decades who won't release his tax returns. And it's either because he's not as rich as he says he is, or—as he admits—he hadn't paid federal income taxes in years. And he says that's smart. He thinks you're suckers for doing what you're supposed to do.\nBut it's not smart not to pay your taxes. All that means is, unlike the rest of us, despite everything that America has given to him, he doesn't feel obliged to give back a single dime to help our troops or our veterans or to make sure that young people get help going to college.\nHe keeps on talking about wanting to make America great. Well, it's people who avoid their responsibilities that create problems here in America. He's not part of the solution, he's part of the problem.\nAnd if you really believe that a guy who's spent 70 years on this Earth, showing no regard for working people, is suddenly going to be the champion of working people, then I guess that's your guy. But if you want leaders who actually value hard work, respect working Americans, who want higher wages and better benefits and a fairer Tax Code, who want equal pay for equal work for women, then you should vote for Hillary Clinton, and you should vote for Patrick Murphy.\nAnd if you want somebody who is going to actually keep your family safe in a dangerous world, then the choice is even clearer. Hillary will see to it that our troops finish the job of defeating ISIL. They are going after them right now as we speak. And she'll do it without resorting to torture or banning religions from our country. She's already got the temperament and the knowledge, the steady hand to be the next Commander in Chief.\nAnd meanwhile, you've got Donald Trump insulting POWs; attacking a Gold Star mom, and talking down our troops and our veterans; praising dictators; telling our allies we might stand—we might not stand by them if they don't pay up.\nI agree with the U.S. Senator—a Republican—who, a while back, said that we can't afford to give \"the nuclear codes of the United States to an erratic individual.\"\nBy the way, you know who said that? Marco Rubio. He also called Donald Trump a dangerous con artist who has spent a career sticking it to working people.\nAudience member. Say it again!\nThe President. You want me to say it again? He said—[laughter]—Marco Rubio said, this was a \"dangerous\" \"con artist\" who spent a lifetime—\"spent a career sticking it to working people.\"\nNow, that begs the question, since we're in Florida: Why does Marco Rubio still plan to vote for Donald Trump? Why is he supporting Donald Trump?\nAudience members. Why!\nThe President. I mean, we know—look, I know a lot of Republicans, voters, just ordinary folks, your neighbors, your friends—most of them don't think the way Trump does. And there are legitimate differences between the parties. But there has to be a point where you stand for something more than just party or more for—than just your own career.\nAnd here's the thing. Trump didn't come out of nowhere now. For years, Republican politicians and far-right media outlets had just been pumping out all kinds of toxic, crazy stuff. I mean, first of all, there was the whole birther thing. Then, they start saying climate change is a Chinese hoax. And according to them, I'm power enough to cause these hurricanes—[laughter]—and I'm about to steal everybody's guns in the middle of the night and declare martial law, but somehow, I still need a teleprompter to finish a sentence. [Laughter]\nSo they have been saying crazy stuff. And there were a lot of politicians, like Marco Rubio, who know better. But they just look the other way, because they figured, you know what, if they really—if we can stir folks up and think that Barack or Hillary or others are doing all these terrible things we're saying they're doing, that's going to help us get votes. And so we'll just oppose anything that they're trying to do, and maybe we'll end up having more power in Washington. And so they just stood by and said nothing—even though they knew better—while their base actually started believing some of this stuff.\nI say all this because Donald Trump didn't start all this. Like he usually does, he just slapped his name on it, took credit for it, and then promoted the heck out of it.\nNow, over the last couple of weeks, after those videos came out on that bus, there were a number of Republican politicians who walked away from Donald Trump. Apparently, a tape where a Presidential candidate brags about actions that, if you hear what he's saying, qualify as sexual assault—apparently, that was the deal breaker for them. Or at least, his poll numbers dropping after the tape came out was the deal breaker for them. I mean, last night, did you hear, Trump tried to run away comments that are on a recording, and the audience started laughing when he said, \"I really respect women.\" [Laughter] Did you see that?\nBut here is my question. My question is, why would it take this long——\nAudience members. Right!\nThe President. ——for Republican Senators and Republican Congressmen and Republican Governors and State reps and State senators—why would it take you this long to figure out that Donald Trump shouldn't be President?\nIf you've made a career of idolizing Ronald Reagan, then where were you when your party's nominee for President was kissing up to Vladimir Putin, the former KGB officer? I—you used to criticize me for even talking to the Russians. Now, suddenly, you're okay with your nominee having a bromance with Putin. [Laughter]\nIf you come from a family of immigrants—like almost everybody here does unless you're Native American—where were you when your party's nominee for President called immigrants \"criminals\" and \"rapists\"?\nIf you say you love the Constitution—in fact, you say Obama is overreaching with his executive actions, he's violating the Constitution, should be impeached—but then you stand up and nominate and support a guy who says that he would silence reporters, jail his political opponent in the middle of a debate, deport whoever he wants. I mean, I assume you've got some familiarity with the 1st Amendment and the 5th Amendment and the 14th Amendment. Why weren't you offering him your pocket Constitution, like Mr. Khan did?\nIf you're a Republican official or leader out there, and you've run for office on family values—family values—why wouldn't you walk away from him months ago when you heard your nominee for President call women pigs and dogs and slobs, and grade them not for their character or their intellect, but on a scale of one to ten?\nYou don't have to be a husband or father to stand up for women. You don't have to have a disability to say it's wrong to mock somebody with a disability. You don't have to be a Muslim to stand up for our fellow citizens who are just as patriotic as we are. You just have to be a decent person, and you just have to love this country.\nSo I don't give a lot of credit for folks who are just now trying to walk away from trouble. Although, I will say I'm even more confused by Republican politicians who still support Donald Trump. Marco Rubio is one of those people. How does that work? How can you call him a con artist and dangerous and object to all the controversial things he says and then say, but I'm still going to vote for him? Come on, man. [Applause] Come on, man. That—[laughter].\nYou know what that is though? It is the height of cynicism. That's a sign of somebody who will say anything, do anything, pretend to be anybody, just to get elected. And you know what? If you're willing to be anybody just to be somebody, then you don't have the leadership that Florida needs in the United States Senate. That's not the leadership you need. That's why you've got to vote for Patrick Murphy. That's why you've got to vote for Hillary Clinton.\nThat's why you've got to start voting early on Monday and go to iwillvote.com. Because, let me tell you, there's only one way we lose this election—just one—if we don't turn out to vote. Only way.\nWe've got to do it big. We've got to leave no doubt. Because you notice, the Donald is already whining that the vote is going to be rigged before the game is even over. We have—we're just starting to vote now. He's already, like, oh, the game is rigged. [Laughter] Except today, he said, of course, it's not rigged if I win. [Laughter]\nI mean, this—and by the way, I will say all the Republicans have—not all, but most, have acknowledged there's no way to rig an election in a country this big. I don't know if Donald Trump has ever been to an actual polling place where you have Democrats and Republicans who are in charge of taking the votes. But he doesn't even worry if what he says is true. This is just about him worried that he's losing, which means, he really doesn't have what it takes to hold this job.\nBecause, I will tell you, there's a lot of time in this job where things don't go your way. And when you suggest—but I've made this point before; I want to repeat it here—this is more than just the usual standard lie. Because when you suggest rigging or fraud, without a shred of evidence, when last night at the debate, Trump becomes the first major-party nominee in American history to suggest that he will not concede, despite losing the vote, and then says today that he will accept the results if he wins, that is not a joking matter.\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. No, no, no, I want everybody to pay attention here. That is dangerous. Because when you try to sow the seeds of doubt in people's minds about the legitimacy of our elections, that undermines our democracy. Then, you're doing the work of our adversaries for them. Because our democracy depends on people knowing that their vote matters; that those who occupy the seats of power were chosen by the people. Even when your preferred candidate loses, even when you are the one who is running and you lose, you've got to see the bigger picture and say that here in America, we believe in democracy and we accept the will of the people.\nSo I'm telling you, Florida, your vote does matter. Your votes does count. And this whole notion of voter fraud, listen, one study shows that out of 1 billion votes cast, there were exactly—there were 31 proven cases of voter fraud—31 out of 1 billion. You are luckier—you are much likelier to get struck by lightning—[laughter]—than to have somebody next to you commit voter fraud. You'd win the Powerball. [Laughter]\nAnd so that's why I am glad to see Republicans coming out and saying that kind of talk is nonsense. I mean, after all, in Florida here, you've got a Republican Governor.\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. Well, don't boo——\nAudience members. Vote!\nThe President. Booing gets you nowhere.\nYou got Republican Governors in battleground States like Ohio and North Carolina and Georgia and Nevada and Iowa, in Texas and Arizona. Are they all in on this rigging? They're not going to rig the election for Hillary Clinton.\nEven Marco Rubio says there's no rigging of the vote, which I'd like to give him credit for, except he's refuting the dangerous and unprecedented claims of a candidate he says he's still going to vote for, which just gives you one more bit of proof that Marco seems to just care about hanging on to his job.\nPatrick Murphy cares about you. Listen, I've lost an election before. It is no fun. Winning is better. But when you lose, you congratulate your opponent. And you look inside yourself, and you figure out, what did I do wrong? And then, you work harder, and you try to win the next time. That's how democracy works. That's what real leaders do.\nDemocracy is a challenge, and it's supposed to be. But you can't just look out for yourself and look out for your own best interests. You've got to look out for America's best interests, not just when it's easy, but when it's hard.\nAnd that's what Patrick Murphy understands. That's what Hillary Clinton has done her entire life. She knows that in this big, diverse country, democracy can't work if all we're about is trying to destroy somebody in the other party, if we demonize each other. If we block Supreme Court appointments, not because that's how it's supposed to work, but just because we didn't win. She knows that issues aren't black or white, that progress requires compromise. Even when you are a hundred-percent right, you still got to compromise in a country like this. She knows that nobody is perfect. But at least we should all try to conduct ourselves with the same decency and generosity and big heartedness that we try to teach our own kids.\nAnd you know what, that kind of steadiness, that kind of responsibility, that attitude of just doing the right thing, it doesn't always grab headlines. Our politics can't always just be boiled down to a tweet. [Laughter] And I know in this election season, sometimes, politics seem cheap and trivial and frustrating. But right now I am here to tell you, you've got a chance to reject that kind of politics. You can reject divisive politics. You can reject mean-spirited politics. You don't have to let this country go backwards. You have a chance to move it forward and elect a woman the first female President, who has spent her entire life trying to make this country better.\nSomebody who has worked hard even when she's fallen short. Somebody who works hard even when she's attacked; that's got guts; that's got courage.\nSo don't fall for the easy cynicism that says your vote doesn't matter. Don't believe that notion that all politicians are the same. That's what Hillary's opponent wants you to think so you lose faith, so you give up, so you stay home. I—don't do that. Because I promise you your vote does matter.\nAnd if you have any doubt, ask the 20 million people who have got health care today that didn't have it before you voted. Ask the marine who can serve this country without hiding the husband that he loves. Ask him if your vote matters. Ask the autoworker who saw his factory go dark, but now is working a double shift. Find out from him if your vote matters.\nI just came from Miami Dade College. And they've got students from about a hundred different countries. Ask all those young immigrants, those DACA kids who have earned an opportunity to stay and study and become doctors and lawyers—young people just like Dominique, just as talented as Malia and Sasha, who now have a chance to contribute to this country that they love just as much as anybody—ask them if your vote matters. They know it does.\nDonald Trump has nothing to offer but anger and grievance and blame. And so he asks—his closing argument asks: What do you have to lose? Well, I'm here to tell you: everything. You know how much progress we've made, despite the opposition, despite the forces of discrimination, despite the politics of backlash. And that progress doesn't stop with my Presidency. We're just getting started.\nSo progress is on the ballot. Civility is on the ballot. Tolerance is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot. Equality is on the ballot. Our democracy is on the ballot.\nHillary Clinton will advance those things. Donald Trump wants to reverse progress. Marco Rubio wants to help him. You want to give me a good send-off, you want to give Michelle a good send-off? Join us. Work as hard for Hillary and Patrick as you did for us. You care about our democracy, don't stay home. You've got to get in the arena. You've got to vote.\nThat's what this democracy is about. It's not a spectator sport. You want to give me a good send-off, go knock on some doors, sign up as a volunteer, make some phone calls, go talk to your friends. And if you do that, we'll win this election.\nWe'll elect Patrick Murphy your next Senator. We'll elect Hillary Clinton the next President. We'll show our kids and the rest of the world why America remains the greatest nation in the world.\nThank you, Miami. God bless you.

Some of them are working two, three jobs but still taking home less money.\nCompanies, like Carrier are firing their workers and moving to Mexico.\nFord is moving all of its small car production to Mexico.\nWhen I'm President, if companies want to fire their workers and leave for Mexico, then we will charge them a 35% tax when they want to ship their products back into the United States. That means the companies won't leave in the first place and, if they do, we'll at least make money when they ship their products across the border.\nHillary Clinton has raised countless millions of dollars from big donors who want to ship our jobs to other countries – including millions of dollars from corporations and countries pushing the Trans-Pacific Partnership. That's how our system is corrupt and broken.\nWe're going to take on big donors, big business and big media that have enriched themselves at your expense.\nThe media is so corrupt that Hillary was given the exact questions to a previous debate, word for word, by Donna Brazile – who is now under tremendous pressure to resign.\nHillary was given the questions, used the questions, and never said that she did something that was totally inappropriate.\nYears ago there was a show called the $64,000 question – a contestant got the questions in advance, his life was ruined.\nThis is even bigger, because we are playing for the presidency of the United States.\nHillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the Presidency.\nNow, from WikiLeaks, we've just learned she tried to get $12 million from the King of Morocco for an appearance – more pay-for-play.\nThat is why I am proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again.\nIt's time to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C.\nThose reforms include the following:\nA 5 year-ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service.\nA lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government.\nA complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections.\nAdditionally, I am going to push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress.\nNot only will we end government corruption, but we will end economic stagnation.\nMy plan for the economy can be summed up in three simple words: Jobs, Jobs, Jobs\nAt the center of my historic jobs plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals.\n47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps.\nWe have nearly an $800 billion dollar annual trade deficit in goods with the world, and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.\nNorth Carolina has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton.\nWe've lost 70,000 factories since China's entry into the World Trade Organization – another Bill and Hillary-backed deal.\nWe are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.\nA Trump Administration is going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to foreign cheating, and stop the jobs from leaving our country.\nWe are going to start making things in America again – and we are going to start making things in North Carolina again.\nIn order to bring manufacturing back to North Carolina, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and so many other places, we are going to undertake a major reform of our federal bureaucracy.\nAmerican trade policy is currently mismanaged by dozens of competing bureaucracies spread across the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, State and Treasury Department and the U.S. Trade Representative.\nIn my administration, all trade policymaking will be consolidated into one Office. It will report to what we call the American Desk. The mission of the American Desk will be to protect the economic interests of the American worker, and the national interests of the United States.\nIt's going to be America First.\nAs part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we are going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent.\nWe are also going to rebuild our inner cities.\nAfrican- Americans and Hispanics living in the inner cities are suffering.\nThe violence is unbearable. You walk to the store with your child and you get shot.\nThere is no education, there are no jobs, there is no safety.\nNearly 3,500 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.\nHomicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore. And it's getting worse.\nTo the African-American and Hispanic voters suffering, I say: what do you have to lose?\nVote for Donald Trump. I will fix it.\nWe will be a rich nation once again.\nBut to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.\nNational Security begins at the border.\nSpeaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally \"open trade and open borders.\"\nHillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East – meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores.\nSo let me state this as clearly as I can.\nIf I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.\nWe will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration.\nA Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes, we will build a wall.\nWe have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers.\nAs Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released because their home countries wouldn't take them back.\nIt was just reported that a man deported from our country 10 times in six years has been charged with raping a 12-year old girl. In August, Texas Police arrested a serial illegal immigrant rapist who had been deported five times, his victims included one 68 year-old woman with a cane who took his offer to drive her home. He left her on the side of a dirt road.\nA 64 year-old Air Force Veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was raped and beaten to death with a hammer by a repeat-offending criminal illegal immigrant who should have been deported – but never was.\nWhat kind of government allows its citizens to suffer such horrors?\nEither we win this election, or we lose the country.\nA victory in November will be a victory for you, the American people.\nHere are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:\nWe are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every low-income child in America, and we are going to end Common Core; support the men and women of law enforcement; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\nYou have 18 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true.\nOur campaign is powered by our love for this country and our love for our fellow citizens.\nIt's a campaign about rejecting the cynicism and elitism of our failed political establishment.\nI am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation.\nI'm going to fight for every child living in poverty.\nI'm going to fight for every mom who lost her child to illegal immigration, and drugs and gang violence.\nI'm going to fight for every community whose jobs and factories have been ripped out of states like North Carolina and shipped to other countries.\nI'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people – not the donors and special interests.\nAnd I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\nYou're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life.\nYou're going to remember this day.\nThis is a movement like you've never seen before.\nYou're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most\nimportant vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time.\nBecause if we win –\nWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.", "timestamp": "2016-10-21", "title": "Remarks at the WNC Agricultural Center's Davis Event Center in Fletcher, North Carolina"}

Trump", "note": "As prepared for delivery.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119186", "text": "Thank you.\nIn 18 days, we are going to win the state of Pennsylvania and we are going to win the White House.\nBut you have to vote on November 8th.\nOur opponents have spent more money than ever before in the history of campaigns – raised from special interests – and yet we are leading in the polls from Rasmussen, LA Times, and Investor's Business Daily.\nTogether, we are going to deliver real change that puts America First.\nWe are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, end Common Core, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.\nYour jobs will come back under a Trump Administration. Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration. Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration. Your companies won't be leaving Pennsylvania under a Trump Administration.\nWe are also going to rebuild our badly depleted military.\nOur Navy is the smallest it's been since World War I. My plan will build the 350 ship Navy we need. This will be the largest effort at rebuilding our military since Ronald Reagan, and it will require a truly national effort. The Philadelphia Navy Yard is a perfect example. I will instruct my Secretary of the Navy to study locations like Philadelphia with a long history of service to our military and proximity to vibrant private industry and find ways to involve them in this national effort.\nAs our fleet is rebuilt, we'll need to invest in recruiting the skilled American craftsmen we need, like welders and pipe fitters and so much more.\nWe will establish 'centers of excellence' in places like Philadelphia and Portsmouth New Hampshire and Hampton Roads in Virginia to produce the master craftsmen we need to rebuild our Fleet.\nWe will rebuild our navy and we will do it with American steel made right here in Pennsylvania.\nAs part of our plan for bold change to make your life better, we will also rebuild our massively depleted infrastructure.\nObama-Clinton doubled the national debt in 8 years – but instead of rebuilding America, the money was all lost and America's infrastructure is like that of a third-world country.\nWe're also spending $6 trillion dollars in the Middle East, with nothing to show for it.\nImagine if we had spent this money rebuilding the inner cities of Philadelphia.\nInstead, we spent trillions on foreign countries and left our own to crumble. We defend other countries' borders, invest in their resources, but abandon our own. The plan I am proposing targets substantial new investment here at home to fix America's transportation, drinking water, and other vital infrastructure. This can be achieved through a focus on public-private partnerships, proven financing programs, and tax credits that incentivize companies to make major job-and-wealth producing investments in the local economy.\nThis means help for projects like the Pennsylvania Turnpike as well as the Pennsylvania portion of the Appalachian Highway System. My plan will also help Pennsylvania upgrade or replace bridges in the Commonwealth that have been deemed \"structurally deficient.\"\nWe are also going to unleash the power of American energy right here in Pennsylvania – shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal.\nWe are putting Pennsylvania back to work, and we are putting the special interests out of work.\nWe are going to renegotiate NAFTA, stop the TPP, and stand up to foreign product dumping and currency manipulation.\nYour city has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA – a deal supported by Hillary Clinton.\n70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States since China entered the World Trade Organization.\nJust a few miles from here, there's a very famous bridge that says: \"Trenton Makes, The World Takes.\"\nUnder a Trump Administration, I can promise you: we are going to start making things in America again – and we are going to start making things in Pennsylvania again.\nYour products will be sent around the world, not your jobs.\nHillary is controlled by special interests who want to ship your jobs to other countries.\nShe's the most corrupt person ever to run for President.\nShe bleached and deleted 33,000 emails – after a Congressional subpoena – lied under oath to Congress, lied to the FBI, obstructed justice, made 13 phones disappear – some with a hammer – and now we learn 2 boxes of evidence have mysteriously gone missing.\nNow, from WikiLeaks, we've just learned she tried to get $12 million dollars from the King of Morocco for an appearance – more pay-for-play.\nThat is why I am proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again.\nIt's time to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C.\nOne new proposal I am outlining today will help us put the corrupt regulation industry out of business.\nI will work with Congress to require that for every 1 new regulation, 2 old regulations must be eliminated.\nWe're losing $2 trillion dollars in economic activity a year to regulations – the only people getting rich are the lobbyists, lawyers and special interests.\nI am also going to push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress.\nNot only will we end government corruption, but we will end economic stagnation.\nMy plan lowers our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent.\nWe are also going to rebuild our inner cities.\nAfrican-Americans and Hispanics living in the inner cities are suffering. The violence is unbearable. You walk to the store with your child and you get shot. There is no education, there are no jobs, there is no safety.\nNearly 3,500 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.\nHomicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore. And it's getting worse.\nTo the African-American and Hispanic voters suffering, I say: what do you have to lose?\nVote for Donald Trump. I will fix it.\nWe will take care of our inner cities, and we will bring safety, prosperity and security to the people of Philadelphia.\nWe will be a rich nation once again.\nBut to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.\nNational security begins at the border.\nSpeaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally \"open trade and open borders.\"\nHillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East – meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores.\nShe even wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees.\nSo let me state this as clearly as I can. If I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.\nWe will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration. A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes, we will build a wall.\nWe have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers.\nIt was just reported that a man deported from our country 10 times in six years has been charged with raping a 12-year old girl. In August, Texas Police arrested a serial illegal immigrant rapist who had been deported five times, one victim included a 68 year-old woman with a cane who took his offer to drive her home. He left her on the side of a dirt road.\nA 64 year-old Air Force Veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was raped and beaten to death with a hammer by a repeat-offending criminal illegal immigrant who should have been deported – but never was.\nIf I'm elected, we will impose tough new mandatory minimum federal prison sentences for anyone who illegally re-enters the country after previously being deported. And we will swiftly remove and deport all criminal aliens from this country, and dismantle the gangs and cartels preying on our citizens.\nEither we win this election, or we lose the country.\nA victory in November will be a victory for you, the American people.\nHere are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:\nWe are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every low-income child in America, and we are going to end Common Core; support the men and women of law enforcement; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\nFor the next 18 days, you have to get every last person you know out to the voting booths.\nThis is our one magnificent chance to reclaim our country for We The People.\nI am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation.\nI'm going to fight for every child living in poverty.\nI'm going to fight for every mom who lost her child to illegal immigration, and drugs and gang violence.\nI'm going to fight for every community whose jobs and factories have been ripped out of states like Pennsylvania and shipped to other countries.\nI'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people – not the donors and special interests.\nAnd I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\nYou're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life.

{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "note": "Remarks as delivered.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119499", "text": "\"Hello Cleveland. Wow. There is nothing like being introduced by Congresswoman Marcia Fudge to get everybody going.\nI am so excited to be here, what a time to be back in Cleveland.\nThe Indians are going to the World Series.\nThat is after the Cavs won the championship. What a year for Cleveland, you really are \"Believe Land.\"\nNow I, for one, am hoping for a Great Lakes series, I spent a lot of days at Wrigley field as a kid, so that would be a dream come true for me, to have Cleveland and Chicago in World Series, and for us to win Ohio.\nI want to thank all of the people who are here today because you've heard from some great, great folks. I want to thank Governor Ted Strickland, our candidate to the United States Senate. I'll tell you, we could really use a Democratic senate to get things done for the people of Ohio and America.\nI wanna thank Mayor Frank Jackson, County Executive, Armond Budish. I wanna thank my great friend from Youngstown, Congressman Tim Ryan.\nAnd we need you all in. We need you all in. You're rallying together and we need to rally together because you know, I really believe we are stronger together!\nAnybody watch the debate Wednesday night? Well, that was the third and last time. That I will ever have to debate Donald Trump.\nI have now spent four and a half hours on stage with Donald, proving once again, I have the stamina to be president and commander in chief.\nReally, you -- you just have to be a good cheer when you find yourself in situations like that.\nAnd because I love this country and I believe in the American people, I could feel so clear in my own mind and my heart about what we can do together. So no matter what he was saying, I just kept thinking of all the people that I have met throughout this campaign. And I had the chance to talk about some of the most important concerns on people's minds, what keeps you up at night. And as I said then and as I have said continuously, we're going to invest in the middle class.\nWe're going to invest in you and your families. We're going to make sure we produce enough good jobs with rising incomes that every single person, especially every single young American here today, will have the chance to go as far as your talents and your hard work will take you.\nAnd we're also going to protect our children from gun violence. We are not going to tolerate the kind of gun violence epidemic that has swept this country and results in the deaths of 33,000 people a year. We can come together to meet our challenges, no matter what they are.\nBut on Wednesday night, Donald Trump did something no other presidential nominee has ever done. He refused to say that he would respect the results of this election.\nNow, make no mistake. By doing that, he is threatening our democracy.\nHe is basically saying hey, we've been around 240 years and we've always had peaceful transitions no matter who won or who lost. Look, if you lose an election -- I've lost elections, you don't feel very good the next day, do you?\nBut we know in our country the difference between leadership and dictatorship, right?\nAnd the peaceful transition -- the peaceful transition of power is one of the things that sets us apart. It's how we hold our country together no matter who's in charge. You know, I went to 112 countries as your secretary of state and I -- I saw the difference between what we do and what others do, I was in countries where people jail their political opponents or execute them or exile them. Or invalidate elections that they didn't win.\nThat can never be allowed to happen here. I believe that's true no matter who you support in this election, whether or not you support me. Or you support my opponent, together, we must support American democracy and the country that has given every one of us so many opportunities.\nAnd the best way to do that, my friends, is to turn out and vote.\n[points to an audience member holding a sign]\nThose are great. That is great. I'm excited because we are well on our way, there is an inspiring story being written right now by people across America, and many of you are getting involved in this election, some of you for the first time in your lives. We now have in America more than 200 million registered voters.\nThat is more than we have ever had in our entire history, and that is really good news for our democracy. More than 50 million millennials have registered.\nYou know what that means? Young people will determine the outcome of this election, which I think is good news. That means our future is in good hands.\nAnd listen to this, because this is really exciting. More than 4 million people have already voted.\nIncluding many people right here in Ohio.\nIn fact, in the first four days of in-person early voting here in Ohio, more people showed up to vote than they did at the same time in 2012, in our last election.\nThat is fantastic and it shows how serious people are taking this election. So numbers like that remind us that no matter all the negativity that's out there, there is something really exciting happening right now. People are coming together. Democrats, Republicans, independents, all of us to reject hate and division.\nPeople are motivated to vote early, to defend core American values, to embrace a future where every person counts, everyone has a place, and everyone can contribute. That is my vision. I have a hopeful, optimistic, unifying vision for what our country will be. Because from the beginning, our campaign has been focused on ideas, not insults, on bringing people together, not tearing us apart.\nAnd I want all of you to know that that is true not only for the campaign, but if I am fortunate enough to be your president, I want you to know, and I want you to tell anybody you know, any friends, or colleagues at school or work, or your neighborhood who may be planning to support the other guy, here is what I want you to tell them.\nI want you to tell them that I want to be their president. I want to be every single American's president, whether you agree or disagree, whether you vote for me or against me.\nI believe we can disagree without being disagreeable. I believe that. And I have seen that happen. I want to be a good listener. I know there are a lot of people here in Ohio who are discouraged, frustrated, even angry about what is going on in their lives, about losing jobs, they are upset about what they see happening around them. I get that.\nBut I think anger is not a plan. We need plans that will help us deal with the legitimate concerns and questions that people have here in Ohio. I think that is what the country needs now. And that is what I will try to offer.\nCLINTON: I am not going to pretend that we can just snap our fingers and solve our problems. That would not be fair. It wouldn't be true. But I know we can make progress together and you deserve something to vote for, not just against.\nSo I want to speak directly to the challenges that a lot of people here in Ohio face, especially when it comes to our economy. You see I believe really simply that when the middle class thrives, America thrives. When we build the economy from the middle out and the ground up, not from the top down, we are more likely to provide better lives, better incomes, better opportunities for more Americans.\nMy opponent has a different perspective. He really believes if you give trillions, that's with a T, trillions in tax cuts to the wealthy, to millionaires and billionaires and corporations, everything will work out. It's really trickle down on steroids. I believe differently that we must invest in working families in the middle class, in small businesses, that will power the economy.\nAnd that's what we're going to do. We're going to get the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top who have done pretty well over the last years. Now Donald likes to say he's on the side of American workers but his actions tell a different story. He has been buying cheap Chinese steel and aluminum for his construction projects when he should be buying good American made steel that supports good American jobs.\nAnd this is a very important issue here in Ohio because you're one of the largest steel producing states in America so you understand how important this is to support the American steel industry so I'm going to let Donald try to explain himself to the steel workers filing for unemployment. He has put Chinese steel workers to work, not American steel workers and we're going to change that.\nAnd for all of his talk about putting America first, he's made his products in at least 12 other countries. Trump's suits were made in Mexico. They could have been made in Brooklyn, Ohio. Trump's furniture is made in Turkey and it could have been made in Cleveland. Trump barware is made in Slovenia instead of Toledo. So if he wants to make America great again, why doesn't he start by making things in America again?\nAnd we also know that he hasn't paid a dime in federal income tax for years.\nHe says that makes him smart. Well, I don't know how smart you have to be to lose $1 billion in a year in the first place. But what that means is everybody else here, all of us, have paid more in federal income taxes than a billionaire, right? And that means he's contributed zero, zero for our military or our vets, zero for Pell grants to help young people go to college, zero for our highways or investing in clean energy or other ways to help us with new jobs for the future.\nNow Tim Kaine and I, we have a different view. We want to make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II. Jobs in infrastructure and manufacturing, clean energy, technology and small business. We are going to make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century.\nAnd I've set some big goals. I want us to deploy a half a billion more solar panels by the end of my first term.\nAnd enough clean energy to power every home within 10 years.\nWe're also going to strengthen education at every level starting with universal pre-kindergarten education.\nAnd we want good schools with good teachers in every zip code so that every kid gets a world class education. I want us to bring back technical education in high school. I think it was a mistake when we took it out of our high schools.\nAnd let's remember, it's at community colleges like this that thousands and thousands of people in our country, of all ages, get such a good start.\nAnd I'm going to make public colleges and universities tuition free for any families making less than $125,000 a year.\nEducation should lift you up, not hold you back. And we're going to help you, we're going to help you pay back and pay down your loans. Too many young people are burdened by those debts.\nIt's going to be great to help you pay it back as a percentage of your income, so you're never on the hook for more than you can afford. Senator Bernie Sanders and I worked on this plan together.\nIt's going to help save millions of people thousands of dollars, and you can actually go to HillaryClinton.com/calculator to see how much money you and your family could save with our plan.\nI also want to do more for apprenticeship programs. I thank all the unions represented here for the great apprentice programs that you have in place. Thank you.\nI want to support apprenticeship programs and skills trainings with business and labor unions, because there are going to be good jobs out there for welders, and machinists, and health technicians, and computer coders, and so much more. I want everybody to have the chance to get your piece of the American dream, and I think the American dream is big enough for everybody.\nAnd we're going to raise the national minimum wage because no one who works full-time should still be in poverty.\nAs I said in the debate the other night, I want to make sure that we take care of people on Social Security who were low-income workers and women, particularly widows, who lose have of their monthly payment when their husbands die.\nWe've got to do more to make sure Social Security provides a decent income for our seniors. And, yes, don't you think it's finally time to guarantee equal pay for women's work?\nNow the equal pay issue is important in and of itself because, if you've got a mother or a wife or a daughter or a sister who's working, you want her to be paid fairly. I mean that's good for the entire family, right?\nBut the equal pay issue gets at something even deeper. We've got to make sure that women and girls are treated with the dignity and respect in our country that they deserve.\nWe cannot -- we cannot tolerate the kind of behavior and language we've seen from my opponent. He thinks that belittling women makes him bigger. Goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don't think there's a woman anywhere who doesn't know how that feels.\nSo we're going to stand up for everybody, men and women, retirees, the young, millennials, everybody deserves to be treated with respect and dignity.\nAnd I have said repeatedly that we're going to reform the criminal justice system so that it works fairly for everyone. And we have to address systemic racism that is still too big a part of our lives together.\nI want to give credit to all the young people, and really people of all ages, who've been marching and speaking out, doing everything you can to make sure that issues of policing and mass incarceration, environmental justice, economic justice, educational equity, gun violence, voting rights, that they get the attention they deserve. Because it's important that we lift these issues up and work to make sure that everybody in our country feels like they are seen and they are heard. And all the advocates and activists who have challenged us to think about these issues of race and justice and equality and opportunity in new and powerful ways really deserve our appreciation.\nI'm going to do everything I can to lift these issues up, because one of my hopes for my presidency will be to root out systemic racism and bigotry and discrimination in whatever form it takes.\nSo really, when you think about it, my name will be on the ballot, but it is not just me. People say, well, she has lots of plans and all of that. I do, but I also have a lot of humility about this.\nI really believe our country is at a turning point, that this is a crossroads election. So yes, my name may be on the ballot, but the question really is, who are we as a country? What are our values? What kind of future do we want to create together?\nIt is so easy to get cynical about politics, believe me, I know that. But this matters so deeply to our families and our communities and our country, and indeed our world.\nSo I want to say something to people who may be reconsidering their support for my opponent. I know you may still have questions for me. I respect that, I want to answer them, I want to earn your vote.\nI am reaching out to all Americans, Democrats, Republicans and independents. I think America needs every single one of us to bring our energy and our talents, our ambition to build that better country.\nSo I hope that as we move through these next 18 days, everyone thinks seriously about what you really want to see, not just in your next president, but in your lives, in your jobs, in your education, in our future together.\nAnd the only way we can have that positive, optimistic, unifying future is if all of you help us get there. Every phone call you make, every door you knock on, every voter you register makes a big difference.\nSo I hope you will give whatever time you can for these last days. You can go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer. You can text \"JOIN,\" J-O-I-N, to 47246 to join. With your help, we can elect Democrats up and down the ballot starting with Ted Strickland and others who are running.\nRemember that early in-person voting in Ohio began on October 12th and it ends on November 7th. So you have more of a window to vote than a lot of people in other states.\nAnd I hope you will exercise that. And I hope that you will decide whatever issue you care about, you can almost in your mind's eye see that on the ballot, see it next to my name, see it whether you care about climate change and what we are doing to protect the Great Lakes, including Lake Eerie, while creating good paying clean energy jobs.\nWhether you believe women should be able to make our own health care decisions.\nIf you believe marriage equality should be protected.\nAnd that LGBT Americans should be treated equally.\nIf you believe we should do more to stop the opioid epidemic that is destroying lives and communities.\nThat we should do more to help with mental health and make sure that people get the treatment that they deserve.\nIf you believe we need to get the cost of health care, premiums, co-pays, deductibles, and prescription drug costs down.\nIf you believe that we should have a foreign policy where we work with our allies, not insult them, and achieve common goals toward peace and prosperity.\nThis is our chance to send a very clear, unmistakable message about what kind of country and future we want.\nYou know, I have two of the most wonderful grandchildren ever, and I see them whenever I can, I FaceTime with them all the time.\nBut I think about them endlessly because I feel such a sense of responsibility, not just because they're my grandchildren, obviously, and I would do anything to help them, but because I want everybody's children and grandchildren to have the same opportunities, to chart your own future, to believe in yourself, to contribute to this great America democracy of ours.\nTo be part on an economy that lifts you up, not drags you down. I am motivated by my work that I've done my entire life on behalf of kids and families.\nFrom the time I joined the Children's Defense Fund, until today. And I will do whatever I can to make it my mission to give every single person, especially every child and young person, the chance to live up to your God-given potential.\nLet's go out and prove that love trumps hate. Thank you!\"", "timestamp": "2016-10-21", "title": "Remarks at Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland, Ohio"}
{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119564", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n11:50 A.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good morning, everybody. TGIF. I do not have any announcements at the top, so we can go straight to your questions.\nKathleen, do you want to start?\nQ: Thanks. I wanted to ask you about these requests that come into the Secretaries of State in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana -- Russians officials are wanting to observe elections and were rejected. I wonder if you have any thought for why that was and if you see this as another attempt from Russia to meddle in the election.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think it's unclear exactly what their intent is with regard to this specific request. The IC has reached -- the intelligence community in the United States has reached a conclusion about what their intent is with regard to some of their nefarious activity in cyberspace, which is to influence the U.S. political process.\nThere is a system in place where the State Department receives requests like the one the Russians have put forward, and then they refer those requests to state officials, and state officials who are responsible for administering elections in their states can then determine the propriety of allowing the observers to participate. So we'll leave it to those state officials to render that judgment.\nThere is a process that is organized by the OSCE -- the Office of Security Cooperation in Europe -- that does observe U.S. elections, and we have been able, in the past, to coordinate effectively with them. Russia has had an opportunity to send essentially individuals to be members of those OSCE delegations to observe U.S. elections. Russia has declined to participate in that way. You'd have to ask them why they didn't take advantage of that opportunity if they were so interested in understanding more about the conduct of a free and fair election, something -- a concept that may not be as familiar to those Russian officials.\nQ: The State Department called this a PR stunt. Do you think that's what it is?\nMR. EARNEST: I wouldn't quibble with that. But again, I think it is unclear exactly what the Russians were intending to do in this case. I think it's appropriate that people might be suspicious of their motives, or at least their motives might be different than what they have publicly stated, given the nefarious activities that they've engaged in in cyberspace.\nQ: And then I wanted to switch to the Supreme Court. I'm sure you saw that Senator Flake came out yesterday and said that it was time to start moving on a Merrick Garland nomination.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes.\nQ: I'm wondering if you -- I assume you're happy to hear that. Have there been any new conversations, or do you see that as a window to restart that process in any way?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this is largely the case that we've been making for more than 200 days now, which is that Republicans in the Senate do have an obligation to do their job and to fulfill their responsibility to treat Chief Judge Garland fairly, meet with him and give him a hearing and a timely yes or no vote. And we obviously welcome the comments of Senator Flake that he believes that's what should happen.\nHe is somebody who has a special influence here because he serves on the Senator Judiciary Committee. This is the committee that would be responsible for organizing these kinds of hearings, as they have for generations. And I did take note yesterday that the chairman of this committee, Senator Grassley from Iowa, had a discussion with some members of the Des Moines Register Editorial Board about this process, and in the context of that discussion, Chairman Grassley indicated that taxpayers couldn't afford for him to hold those hearings. It would require hiring additional staff in order to do so.\nThe American people have actually hired, already, senators to fulfill their basic responsibility. And that basic responsibility is to give a fair hearing to the President's nominee to the Supreme Court. So Senator Grassley is wrong when he says that the American people can't afford to hold those hearings. The truth is, the American people and the people of Iowa can't afford to be paying the salary of a Senator who's not doing his job. And Chairman Grassley has not been doing his job. And that is, unfortunately, a rather significant departure from the rest of his Senate career. I know that he's somebody who prides himself on acting in a nonpartisan fashion and putting the best interests of the people of Iowa and the people of this country above his party. But in this regard, he has failed to do that in this situation and I think as is evident from his rather lame explanation for why he hasn't been doing his job.\nThat's different than Senator McConnell bragging about not doing his job, but is concerning nonetheless. And I think in some ways the comments of Senator Flake underscore just how indefensible the position is that's been adopted by Chairman Grassley.\nQ: And just one more. I'm sure you noticed then that Secretary Clinton didn't mention Garland by name when she was asked about the Court in the debate the other night. And I'm wondering if you take that as a sign that she doesn't intend to re-nominate him.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what she stated pretty candidly is her view that the United States Senate has a responsibility to consider the nominees that a President puts forward. And she indicated her strong support for that principle. She also has indicated her strong support for the President's decision to nominate Chief Judge Garland. She did that on the very day that Chief Judge Garland's name was put forward.\nSo I don't know who President Clinton would nominate to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court if she is elected President. At this point, I don't know if there will be a vacancy on the Supreme Court the day that she takes office. We continue to make the case that the Congress should act. Either way, if she's President of the United States and there's a vacancy on the Supreme Court, she will decide who she believes is the person that should fill that vacancy, and the Senate would have a responsibility to give that person a hearing and a timely yes or no vote.\nJeff.\nQ: Josh, can you confirm a report by some of my colleagues today that a U.S. Navy warship has carried out a freedom of navigation operation in the South China Sea? And if so, can you explain what the U.S. hopes to achieve with that type of operation?\nMR. EARNEST: Jeff, I can confirm that last night, the USS Decatur conducted a freedom of navigation operation in the South China Sea, specifically in the vicinity of the Paracel Islands. The purpose of this mission was to uphold the rights and freedoms of all states under international law as reflected in the Law of the Sea Convention. This operation demonstrated that coastal states may not unlawfully restrict the navigation rights, freedoms and lawful uses of the sea that the United States and all states are entitled to exercise under international law.\nAs we've discussed at some length in here, the United States is not a claimant to land features in the South China Sea. The view of the United States is that disputes about claims to those features should not be resolved through coercion or military force or intimidation, but rather through negotiation. And that's a principle that we believe strongly in. And our interests in the region, again, are not rooted in particular claims or supporting particular claims that are made by countries with overlapping disputes, but rather our view that international order is best maintained if these kinds of disputes are resolve through negotiation. And our interest is that this is a region of the world through which a lot of commerce passes and the disruption of some of these commercial shipping lanes could have a negative impact on the global economy, and even a negative impact on the U.S. economy.\nSo that's what our interest is, and that is an interest that we will look for opportunities to convey. And that essentially is the message that was sent by the operation that was carried out by the USS Decatur last night.\nQ: Are you concerned at all that China will view this as a provocative act?\nMR. EARNEST: They shouldn't. I guess you'd have to ask them for a response. They shouldn't, because this is a principle that reflects what we believe is the broad interest of the international community. We believe that it's in China's interest to ensure that international norms are not violated or international order is not disrupted in this region of the world.\nChina has a significant economic interest in this region of the world in the same way that the United States does as well. And the kind of -- or the principle of freedom of navigation in international waters is one that we assert not just on behalf of the United States and the United States military, but one that we assert on behalf of states all around the world, including China. So you'll have to ask the Chinese for a response to this particular action, but we would not intend for this to be viewed as some sort of a controversial or confrontational action on the part of the United States, but rather an illustration of our firm commitment to an important principle that serves the interests of countries around the world.\nMichelle.\nQ: We've heard some interesting statements from the President of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, the last couple days. I mean, his office today is seeming like they want to walk some of it back and saying that he wasn't fully saying that he wants to completely -- I think you know what I'm saying.\nMR. EARNEST: I do.\nQ: Okay.\nMR. EARNEST: I've dubbed that person the Filipino Mike Pence. (Laughter.)\nQ: But what do you make of the impact of his words? I mean, there's a point -- often we say, okay, let's look at actions, this is rhetoric. But is there a point now with Duterte that it's gone beyond rhetoric and that some of what he's saying is actually either damaging or dangerous to the relationship?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Michelle, we certainly have seen a lot of this kind of troubling rhetoric recently. The rhetoric is inexplicably at odds with the warm relationship that exists between the Filipino and American people, and the important cooperation that's existed between the U.S. and the Philippines at a government and military level for decades. We haven't heard any specifics from the Filipino government about what precisely President Duterte means when he refers to a separation, but those comments are creating unnecessary uncertainty in our relationship.\nDanny Russel, who is a senior State Department official, is actually traveling to the Philippines on a previously scheduled trip to have a discussion about the scope of the relationship between the United States and the Philippines, and I'm confident that these recent comments from President Duterte will be on the agenda as we seek some clarity from the Filipino government.\nFor the United States, I can tell you that we will continue to do what we've been doing for a long time, which is we're going to honor our alliance commitments and our treaty obligations. And our expectation is that the Philippines will do the same thing. The United States and the Philippines have been allies for 70 years, and we value the relationship that we have with the Philippines. And the truth is, the Filipino people and the Filipino government have benefitted tremendously from the warm relationship that they have with the United States. And you can evaluate that in terms of our security cooperation. You can evaluate that in terms of the deep economic ties between our two countries. You can even evaluate that based on the deep cultural ties between our two countries, including a vibrant and active Filipino American population that's concerned about the relationship -- or the uncertainty that's been added to the relationship between the United States and the Philippines.\nQ: This is somebody, obviously, who is now known around the world for his rhetoric. That's probably why he was elected. So at this point, do you take those words seriously? I mean, does it reach a certain point where you do? Or do you generally just see this as more rhetoric that is designed to make a statement or get some rise out of the United States.\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, when you're the leader of a nation that has a seven-decade-long alliance with the United States, it comes with a set of important responsibilities, including understanding the consequences for your public statements. And we've seen too many troubling public statements from President Duterte over the last several months. And the frequency of that rhetoric has added an element of unnecessary certainty into our relationship that doesn't advance the interests of either country. And, frankly, it is at odds with the warm relationship between the citizens of our two countries, and it certainly is at odds with the benefits that the Philippines has enjoyed as a result of the alliance between our two countries.\nQ: Are you seeing within some of his statements a real intent to back away from the agreements and the relationship with the United States?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think the bottom line here, Michelle, is that there is some uncertainty about what, exactly, his intent is. Again, you all have extensively covered the kind of rhetoric that he has used. Some of it personal, some of it offensive, some of it confusing, all of it walked back by senior officials in his government. So that's the source of the uncertainty that will certainly be part of the discussions that the Assistant Secretary of State, Mr. Russel, will convene in the Philippines when he arrives there.\nQ: Okay. And we just heard from the Italian Prime Minister, talking about the potential of further sanctions on Russia over Syria, saying that he doesn't think that that works, that that doesn't change the behavior, that there's no point to it. What do you think of his thoughts on that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the United States approach has been to leave the option of sanctions on the table. And what we -- in discussing publicly these options, we've made clear that our concerns about Russia's behavior in Syria are significant. And we've also made clear that the use of this particular option -- financial sanctions -- is most effective when implemented in careful coordination with our allies and partners around the world.\nWe've also been reluctant to speak in much detail in advance about what a potential sanctions architecture could look like, because, frankly, we don't want to tip off individuals or entities that could be the target of those sanctions so that they could begin to take steps to evade them before they've even been put in place.\nSo I can't get into a lot of detail in terms of characterizing our thinking about this, but the United States is deeply engaged with our allies in Europe, but also with countries in the region, to look for ways to reduce the violence inside of Syria, including by holding Russia accountable for their actions in Syria, which have been entirely counterproductive to reaching a solution that advances the national security interests of countries around the world.\nSo Secretary Kerry and other State Department officials remain deeply engaged in a variety of multilateral efforts to try to arrive at that kind of conclusion, and we're going to discuss with those partners a wide range of options, including the potential of using some of the financial sanctions tools that, in the context of Ukraine, have imposed some economic costs on Russia that have hurt their economy.\nQ: It doesn't change his behavior, though. It sounds like you agree that the behavior hasn't changed. I mean, that's obvious for all to see. But by leaving it on the table, it seems like you're saying that there is a potential for it to do something, though.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think there is the potential that adding additional sanctions and imposing additional costs on Russia -- we know at least one impact it will have, and it's a negative impact on the Russian economy. And it is among the tools that are available to the President and the rest of the international community for trying to reduce the violence in Syria that's gone on for far too long.\nAnd as we discussed in here at some length, there is a fundamental contradiction in the strategy that President Putin has pursued. He has intervened militarily in a conflict to shore up the Assad regime even though he says that the Assad regime needs to negotiate a political transition in that country.\nSo if we can mobilize the international community to apply additional pressure to Russia to resolve that fundamental contradiction in their strategy and in their tactics, then that could potentially lead to the kind of reduction in violence that's, frankly, long overdue.\nJustin.\nQ: There were attacks overnight in Kirkuk and at a power plant in Iraq. That seemed to be an indication that even if the coalition is advancing towards Mosul, ISIS's focus may be shifting from holding territory to insurgency or terror attacks. So I know we've heard a lot about the preparations for Mosul, but I'm wondering if the U.S. has done anything in coordination with Iraq -- the Iraqi government -- to help them sort of fortify themselves for the possibility of terror attacks, and also if that concern could spread to the U.S. and Europe about ISIS-directed or ISIS-inspired attacks and whether that would spur the U.S. government to kind of -- Homeland Security to worry about the doing some --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, why don't I take the first part of your question first in terms of the situation in Iraq. You'll recall, Justin, that there were a series of bombings in Baghdad earlier this year, and in response to that situation, the United States did ramp up the kind of assistance that we can provide to the Iraqi central government to help them better protect their homeland and to better help prevent the infiltration of ISIL personnel into major urban areas where they could do significant damage.\nSo that kind of cooperation already exists between the United States and Prime Minister Abadi's government. And we stand ready to offer assistance or equipment or expertise or advice to the Iraqi government as they respond to this latest breach of their homeland security, if you will.\nWith regard to ISIL's ability to focus its efforts outward and to expand and inspire people around the world to carry out acts of violence, this is a threat that we have long been focused on mitigating. Many of the military operations that the President of the United States has ordered have been focused in taking ISIL's chief external plotters off the battlefield. And we do know that the success of a couple of those military operations has had an impact on the ability of ISIL to organize and plot overseas attacks, but we remain vigilant about it.\nOur principal concern from the very beginning was that ISIL could try to establish some kind of safe haven in this region of the world and use it to plot and organize attacks against the United States and our allies. So that is the most direct threat that we are very focused on, and we continue to be. We've made progress in minimizing that threat. We know that taking these external plotters off the battlefield makes it harder for them to plot and plan. We know that just applying pressure to ISIL's leadership in general makes it harder for them to plot and plan against the United States. If they're very focused on their own safety it makes it harder for them to threaten the safety of other p around the world.\nAnother key aspect of ISIL's propaganda efforts has been to try to send a message to people around the world that they're establishing a caliphate there and that using the establishment of that caliphate added a lot of credibility to their argument and could aid their ability to inspire people to carry out acts of violence. So that's why we've been steadily focused on trying to undermine that message. And we rolled back more than 50 percent of the territory that ISIL previously controlled in Iraq. We now have the Iraq capital of ISIL in the crosshairs. So that certainly had undermined their ability to deliver a potent propaganda message about the power and influence of ISIL. That is going to have a negative impact on their ability to inspire people around the world to carry out acts of violence in their name.\nBut I guess the shortest answer to your question, Justin, is simply that the United States continues to be very focused on protecting the American people and our allies from the threat that emanates in Iraq and Syria from ISIL.\nQ: Ash Carter is visiting Turkey today. I'm wondering if he's going to be explicitly asking Erdogan to pull his troops back from the camp outside of Mosul and not participate in this defensive. If so, what you kind of rate the likelihood of being able to broker a solution there or an agreement between the Iraqis and the Turks.\nMR. EARNEST: Justin, I'll let my colleagues at the Department of Defense read out the specifics of the meetings that Secretary Carter has with President Erdogan. The message that we have delivered publicly is the same one we delivered privately, which is that our Counter-ISIL Coalition is operating in Iraq at the request of the Iraqi central government to support Iraqi security forces who are fighting for their own country. And that is a principle that we have insisted on from the very beginning of our counter-ISIL efforts.\nAnd Turkey has had a military presence in Iraq because of a concern that they have about some extremist Kurdish elements in Iraq. But we have made clear that any effort, or any operation that's undertaken in support of the counter-ISIL operation is one that must be coordinated with and in support of orders given by the Iraqi central government.\nAnd thus far, with regard to that Turkish presence outside of Mosul, we have not seen movements that have raised concerns about the Turks violating that principle. But obviously, this is a situation that we'll continue to monitor. And Secretary Carter and others will continue to stay in close touch with their Turkish counterparts to remind them of, frankly, how strongly we feel about that principle.\nQ: There was a report from the United Nations that as many as 550 families outside of Mosul might have been gathered up by ISIL, brought into the city to be used as human shields. I'm wondering if you guys have seen that, if you agree with that assessment, and if you're doing anything sort of in response to redirect the offensive.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I can't independently confirm that report. Obviously, the U.N. has extensive resources on the ground, so I'd refer you to them in terms of trying to get to the facts of that specific matter.\nThe truth is, Justin, there are more than a million people in the population of Mosul, and all of them are at risk of being used as human shields. And there has been deep concern expressed by some observers about the potential humanitarian contingencies that could arise from an operation against Mosul. The truth is there's already a serious humanitarian situation that exists inside of Mosul right now. We know that ISIL in Mosul has carried out heinous acts of violence in order to subdue the local population. They have flagrantly violated the rights of the citizens of that city, and we know it is likely that they will try to use some of those innocent civilians as human shields, even in the context of this operation.\nSo we continue to be deeply concerned about the situation there. And while I can't confirm that report that you've cited, if true, it would only add to the longstanding concerns that we already have about the current situation inside of Mosul, even in advance of Iraqi and Kurdish forces entering the city.\nQ: Last one, on a different topic. There's a massive denial of service attack this morning that caused problems for dozens of U.S. businesses -- Twitter, Reddit, Spotify. Is the U.S. aware of this? And is there any concern that this could be part of what seems to be an escalating cyber war with Russia?\nMR. EARNEST: I have seen the reports of this. I know that the Department of Homeland Security -- that is the U.S. government agency that is responsible for monitoring our security in cyberspace and coordinating with the public and private sector to protect U.S. interests in cyberspace -- is monitoring this situation. And they'll take a close look at it. But at this point, I don't have any information to share about who may be responsible for that malicious activity.\nAndrew.\nQ: Jacob Zuma has decided to pull South Africa out of the ICC. I'm wondering whether that alters your view on South Africa's role in fomenting instability and the rule of law in the region.\nMR. EARNEST: Andrew, I have to admit I had not seen that report before I came out here, but why don't we take a look at it and get you a response.\nQ: The President yesterday called for a big victory in November. I wonder if he agrees with your old colleague, Mr. Plouffe, and his assessment that it's necessary to run up the big score against Donald Trump in order to repudiate not just the candidate but his ideas.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President has spoken at length about what he believes the stakes are of this election. And the President is certainly not taking any votes for granted. I think that's why you have seen him make such a vigorous case for Secretary Clinton and for other Democrats on the campaign trail. And his activity in the two and a half weeks that remain before Election Day is only going to increase.\nSo the President is not just guarding against, but warning against complacency. And I recognize how that can be confused for trying to run up the score, but the President understands the stakes of this election, and as he alluded to yesterday, his view is that the only way that Democrats lose this election is if they don't actually show up at the polls; that there's ample public evidence to indicate that most voters and most Americans are supportive of the ideas that Democrats have put forward. And the challenge now is just ensuring that those voters express that view at the polling place. And the President will be making that case in the days ahead.\nIf that includes a clear, unambiguous, unmistakable repudiation of the divisive rhetoric and cynical tactics that are used by Republicans, that would be a welcome outcome as well.\nQ: I take your point that the broader sense that you see the margin of victory in the general election is important.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, the President has expressed his deep concerns about the divisive rhetoric and the cynical tactics that have been deployed by Republicans. His concern is that that rhetoric and those tactics are inconsistent with American values and inconsistent with the kinds of democratic traditions that previous generations of Americans fought and died for.\nAnd so the President is cognizant of the stakes in this election and believes that people should not be complacent, and that a strong outcome in terms of repudiating the rhetoric and pessimistic vision that's put forward by the other side would be a good outcome.\nIt's not going to end the debate, because, ultimately, there is going to have to be a decision made by Republicans -- not just those that are on the ballot but those that are in Congress -- to decide if they're prepared to actually focus on some kind of governing agenda again. For the last several years, we've seen Republicans focus all their efforts on colorfully opposing any progress that President Obama advocates -- so much so that they end up opposing the kinds of policies that they'd previously backed just because President Obama is the one that's putting them on the table. And that has led Republicans to a situation where even Republicans are wondering what Republicans in Congress stand for. And I think that's why you see such intense dissatisfaction for Republican leadership in Congress, not just across the American electorate, but even among voting Republicans.\nSo this election is important because of the people who will take office as a result of this election, but it's also important to recognize that this debate and this question about the health and vitality and functionality of our system of government is going to extend beyond Election Day, and it's going to include some pretty significant soul-searching on the part of Republicans.\nAnd this is not just a view that you've heard the President express. This is a view that leading Republicans in Washington, D.C. have expressed. This is part of what Senator Flake I think is referring to and expressing his concern about the way that the Senate has treated Chief Judge Garland for the last 200 days or so. He is somebody that some Republicans have described as a consensus nominee. Some of those same Republicans are refusing to even hold a hearing to consider his nomination. I think that is exhibit A in illustrating how Republicans have abandoned any sort of principle, any sort of notion of advancing a common-sense governing ideology so they can prioritize throwing sand in the gears of government.\nAnd when it comes to midterm elections, that has allowed them make some political gains. That's proved to be an effective political tactic, but it has not proved to be an effective strategy for running the country or enhancing the confidence of the American people that Republicans have a clue as to what they should do about the future of the country.\nSo that's a longer answer, I think, than I intended to give when I started giving it, but I think it's an illustration of how the question that you're asking is relevant not just for the next 18 days, but for -- certainly these are the kinds of questions that Democrats and Republicans are going to have to answer on into the next administration.\nQ: Just a very quick one. Duterte was just speaking in his hometown, and he said he won't sever ties with the U.S. Does that clear things up?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think that we will -- based on his extensive, colorful previous comments, there is greater clarity that we would like to get about the intent of President Duterte and his government. But based on what you've read me, that seems to be a change in tone that is more consistent with the seven decade-long alliance between the United States and the Philippines.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Do you deny that the White House is so confident that Secretary Clinton is going to win the election that the President can really expend a lot of capital down ballot? It seems to me that he's putting a lot of energy and effort in that, and not just the President, but also key surrogates -- the Vice President, the First Lady.\nMR. EARNEST: The good news, Kevin, is that the White House has the capacity to do both. You saw President Obama deliver a very forceful speech not just in support of Secretary Clinton yesterday, but also in support of the Democratic candidate for the Senate. So I would expect that in the two and a half weeks or so that remain, that you'll see the President, as he travels, make a forceful case not just for Secretary Clinton -- although that's his primary objective -- but also to articulate his support for Democrats up and down the ballot.\nI would also hasten to add that President Obama's ability to try to persuade voters in the context of this election is not just limited to the geographic locations where he chooses to travel. President Obama has already appeared in a wide range of television ads that will be airing across the country over the next couple of weeks -- again, not just for Secretary Clinton, but for Democratic candidates for the House and Senate, but also even some Democrats at the state level, as well. And again, I think this is a testament to the deep reservoir of political will and support that the President has not just among Democrats across the country, but also among independents.\nAnd the President is prepared to use that capital to benefit Democrats in this election because those Democrats share his values, and those Democrats are committed to building on the kind of progress that we've made over the last eight years. It doesn't mean that President Obama agrees with every Democrat on every issue, but it does mean he has confidence that Democratic candidates are the ones who are committed to pursuing the kind of economic strategy that benefits the middle class and that will benefit the U.S. economy over the long term, and a national security strategy that will effectively advance our interests around the world.\nQ: Let me ask you about that strategy. Because on the one hand, it seems like the President is sort of -- pretty pointedly talks to the GOP base and says things like, well, how can you support a guy who did X, Y and Z, but then at the same time, the woman who had hoped to be his successor seems to be courting that very same base, saying, hey, listen, GOP voters out there, you should vote for me. Why the disconnect?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think you may be misunderstanding the President's message. I think the President is actually making a broad appeal to Democrats, Republicans and independents that frankly they should be asking tough questions of Republican candidates for office who continue to support the Republican presidential nominee, based on all of the controversial rhetoric, based on all of his comments that indicate an abject opposition to the kinds of values that we hold dear in this country. I think that does raise some serious questions about the judgment and character of many Republican candidates for office. And that is something the President believes that Democratic, independent, and Republican voters should consider as they evaluate the candidates below the top line of the ticket.\nQ: Let me ask you about the latest round of leaks. And I know that you've been loath to sort of comment on them, specifically, because some of the veracity of what has been leaked has been in question. But still, it seems to be sort of a cascade of more inside information that seems to buffet the argument that Bernie Sanders and others weren't treated equally by the Democratic Party. How do you reach out then to the voters who backed him so strongly, and make the case to them that they should back Secretary Clinton -- when it seems to me, and certainly seems to a lot of them, the books were cooked, if you will, throughout that process?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think each voter is going to have to make up their own mind. And many of those people all across the country who chose to be active in support of Senator Sanders's campaign for President did so because they were animated by a core set of values and priorities and an idea of where they would like to see the country go. They were supportive of a candidate who is looking for a more just America, and a government that was looking out for the interests of middle-class families and college students who are borrowing significant sums of money to try to prepare themselves for a 21st century global economy. They got involved in his campaign because they want to make sure that the next President is somebody who actually acknowledges the reality of climate and is committed to doing it. They supported his campaign because they want somebody who is going to responsibly try to advance the interests of the United States in the international community.\nAnd our expectation is that they will continue to be motivated by those values and that vision, and use it to determine who they should support in the upcoming election. And that certainly is what Senator Sanders himself has urged them to do. And if they take his advice, I think basically all of them are going to be supportive of Democrats in the next election.\nQ: Is there a concern that that won't be the case?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we're certainly not going to take anything for granted. And I think that you've heard the President make rather direct appeals to people who had previously supported Senator Sanders's campaign and talked to them about the stakes in this election, and that the same kinds of values and priorities that prompted them to be engaged in support of Senator Sanders are the kinds of values and priorities that should lead them to support Democrats up and down the ballot in this election.\nQ: Lastly, I want to ask you about something that we've talked about just a bit, and that's the Clinton Foundation. Is it the administration's perspective that the Clinton Foundation and sort of the relationships that Secretary Clinton had with leaders and others from different countries around the globe who were then later found to have donated to the Clinton Foundation -- is that consistent with the messaging that this administration wanted by way of its Secretary of State?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, I don't think this is about messaging. This is about making sure that you have a Secretary of State that is putting the interests of the United States of America first when she's engaged in her professional responsibilities and representing the interests of the United States at a very high level.\nQ: But blur the line, wouldn't you admit?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't think there's any evidence that Secretary Clinton did anything that was contrary to the interests of the United States. In fact, we saw that she acted and conducted herself very effectively to advance our interests around the world. And the President is proud of her service as Secretary of State.\nJordan.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I want to follow up on something Kevin asked about. The speech yesterday -- I mean, it seemed less of a speech in support of Patrick Murphy than a takedown of Marco Rubio. I mean, it almost sounded like that Marco Rubio spit in the President's coffee or something. He seemed really going hard at him. And beyond what you said about Senator Rubio continuing to support Donald Trump, and everything the President mentioned, I mean, is there some kind of personal history there? Why did the President go after Senator Rubio so hard when we really haven't seen him go that hard on other specific Republican senators the way he did yesterday?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think the President made a very vigorous case in support of Democrats. And yes, he raised sharp questions about the judgment of Senator Rubio and others who continue to pursue a strategy that prioritize obstruction and opposition over everything else. There's a great example, which is Senator Rubio, at one point, played a constructive role in trying to broker a bipartisan compromise for immigration reform. He did so -- Senator Rubio did so because he recognized that that would benefit the country and because it's consistent with our values, and because it reflects his own personal story. But he turned his back on all of that when the politics got tough.\nThe President believes, as he said yesterday, that that says something about his character. It says something about his priorities that he pursues when he's in elective office. And it sounds like, and it appears from that episode, that those priorities are much more centered on his political ambition, his desire to be loyal to his party, his desire to raise money from Republican donors, and not the best interest of the U.S. economy or securing the border, or fighting for the kinds of values that he occasionally speaks rather eloquently about on the campaign trail.\nAgain -- and this is not -- I know it may have seemed to Senator Rubio like a pretty direct and even personal criticism. But this is a concern that the President has about a wide variety of Republicans that he's been dealing with over the last eight years. Republicans in Congress time and time again prioritize political tactics that obstruct the President's agenda over the national interests, over the success of the national economy, over investments in the middle class, over the safety of our national security.\nThat's unfortunate. And it is an indication of the state of the Republican Party. And it's how you end up in a situation where a bunch of Republican voters nominate somebody who has gained notoriety because of his colorful opposition to President Obama, but doesn't actually show much interest in trying to advance a conservative governing agenda. That's how Republicans have ended up where they are. And that's the kind of soul searching that they're going to have to engage in after the election to figure out how they're going to get back on track.\nThe President -- and you guys have heard him say this too -- the President is interested in a Republican Party -- he believes the country is well-served by a Republican Party that, for all their differences with Democrats, is actually interested in trying to move the country forward. It doesn't mean folding on all their principles. In fact, it means trying to stand up for those principles and looking for opportunities to work with Democrats to advance them. And there was an opportunity to do that in the context of immigration reform until people like Senator Rubio walked away when the political heat got a little too tough.\nAnd the President is hopeful that the next President of the United States will have a different set of partners in Congress to work with.\nLana.\nQ: Hey, Josh. Has the White House been assured by Judge Garland that if Hillary Clinton is elected President, he will not remove his name from consideration?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Lana, that's not how it works. His name is in consideration until the Congress adjourns at the end of the year, and then there will have to be a reevaluation by the White House about whether or not to put him forward. And Secretary Clinton, if the vacancy is still there, will have to decide if she wants to nominate him or somebody else to fill that vacancy.\nBut I can tell you that President Obama certainly is committed to his candidacy and believes that he should serve on the Supreme Court. And I certainly know that somebody with the credentials of Chief Judge Garland, who could serve the country so well on the Court, is still very interested in using those skills to benefit the American people on the Supreme Court.\nQ: But there will be a period of reevaluation, as you mentioned, after the election, as to whether or not -- let me say it this way. Republicans have said that they will consider Judge Garland's nomination if Secretary Clinton is elected President. We have been wondering if that's going to happen. And can we be assured that Judge Garland is not going to say, now that a Democrat has been elected he no longer wants to be considered?\nMR. EARNEST: I have seen no evidence to indicate that Chief Judge Garland is somehow going to withdraw his name from the process. And President Obama is certainly committed to doing everything we can to see Chief Judge Garland be confirmed to the Supreme Court.\nQ: But has the White House asked him about that specifically, since it's something that the Republicans are discussing very publicly?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any -- I don't know why we would ask him. I don't know why he would wait around for 200 days and then pull out at the very moment that it seemed likely that he was going to get confirmed. So I think that's not likely to happen.\nQ: WikiLeaks. Your statement last night was -- or your office's statement last night was that you wouldn't comment on hacked emails of a private citizen. At that point, Mr. Obama was a sitting senator. He was President-elect. Why make the distinction about a public citizen? And certainly you can't claim that for Mr. Obama at that point.\nMR. EARNEST: Right, they weren't his emails that were hacked, they were the emails of Mr. Podesta, who is a senior official on the Clinton campaign. And it's his emails who were hacked. And again, you guys get to make your own journalistic determination about whether or not it is appropriate to report on that kind of stolen material, but I'm not going to comment on material that was stolen from a private citizen just because it's been thrust into the public sphere, in part because there has been a determination that's been made by the intelligence community that the kinds of tactics that were used to plunder Mr. Podesta's emails are the same tactics that we know the Russians have used in other settings to get access to material and make it public in an effort to undermine our political system.\nSo I guess I have lots of good reasons, lots of principled reasons for not commenting on it.\nQ: Okay. And finally, just one more question about the election. How is the White House feeling about the down-ballot effects of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think -- I'll let you guys play the sort of political analysts. And I think that there's lots of spinning going on by both sides. I haven't heard a lot of people spinning that the Republican nominee is helping Republicans down the ballot, but maybe there are some people out there who can make that case, and it's a free country so they're welcome to do so.\nWhat the President is focused on is making sure that Americans understand the stakes of this election. And it matters deeply who succeeds President Obama in the Oval Office, but it's also pretty important who will represent communities across the country in the United States Senate, who is going to represent communities across the country in state legislatures. The stakes in this election are high, not just at the presidential level but at the legislative level, too -- both for the federal government but also for state government. And the President is going to make his voice heard, and he's going to make a forceful case for Democrats up and down the ballot. And he's in a position where we expect a lot of Americans to be persuaded by his advocacy.\nQ: Any other candidates that the President will really be pushing for in these final days?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, many. Stay tuned.\nChip.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Of course, the First Lady is out on the campaign trail, too. They've both been making a lot of noise lately. And a lot of pundits and writers have been saying that the First Lady is Hillary Clinton's most potent surrogate. Would the President agree that she has more power to move the needle in this election than he does?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the President would agree that there are just some basic facts about the First Lady. The first is, she is somebody who enjoys the deep respect of a large majority of Americans.\nQ: But does she have more power than he has in this election to change people's minds?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, she also is somebody who is a very persuasive speaker. She is somebody who has been able to make a forceful, personal case about why she's involved in this election. And yes, I think the President would admit that his wife is an enormously influential and powerful surrogate in support of Secretary Clinton.\nQ: More than he?\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah, I think he would -- for all the reasons that I just cited, based on the strong support and deep respect that people across the country have for her; based on the compelling personal argument that she has been making in support of Secretary Clinton. And she's also quite talented in her own right when it comes to delivering a speech. And those things I do think combine to make her a very powerful advocate for Secretary Clinton and probably the most powerful advocate that Secretary Clinton has.\nQ: Could we rewind the tape for a second here and go back to your conversation with Michelle when you said -- when you compared President Duterte of the Philippines to Mike Pence. Can you repeat what you said and explain the likeness a little bit?\nMR. EARNEST: So I'm glad you asked, because Michelle was actually making reference to the significant number of senior Filipino officials who have tried to walk back certain things that President Duterte has said. In some cases, they've gone to the extraordinary length of denying that he's even said them when the videotape would suggest otherwise. And I think many of you have observed that Governor Pence found himself in a similar position a couple weeks ago.\nRon.\nQ: Just back to Mosul. Do you have anything more on the American servicemember who was killed in the operation?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Ron, let me start by saying that the Department of Defense did announce yesterday that an American had been killed in support of -- while he was supporting a Peshmerga operation in Iraq. And the thoughts and prayers of everybody at the White House are with the family of that U.S. servicemember who was killed in action yesterday.\nAs you've heard me say on a number of occasions, those American servicemembers who are serving our country in Iraq are doing very dangerous work and they are putting their lives on the line to protect our national security. There is a clear threat that emanates from ISIL and they are operating in a dangerous part of the world to try to mitigate that threat.\nNow, the role that they are playing is to offer their advice and assistance to Iraqi security forces and Kurdish forces that are taking the fight to ISIL, on the ground, in their own country. That means that they don't have a combat role, but the work that they are doing is very dangerous. And they are equipped for combat because, in some cases, they find themselves in situations where they need to -- are forced to defend themselves. And so --\nQ: Was this individual on the front lines?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have details about the incident itself. I know that the Department of Defense is investigating the situation to learn more about what exactly happened, and updates on the situation will come from them.\nQ: But it's still the White House assuring the American public that there are not -- maybe I'm wrong -- that there are not Americans on the front lines in this fight.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what we see in these situations, Ron, is that there are -- and this sort of goes to Andrew's question -- Kirkuk, for example, has not been on the front lines of the conflict, but it was the site of very serious violence yesterday in Iraq. And there were significant casualties as a result of ISIL's activities in that location that was not on the front lines.\nSo I can't speak to exactly where this servicemember was, but based on the fact that they were serving our country in Iraq, acting in support of the Peshmerga advance on Mosul, is an indication that they were in a very dangerous situation and that they were in that dangerous situation because they were trying to protect the United States of America. And we owe that servicemember and their family a deep, deep debt of gratitude.\nQ: Is the President willing to do -- to win this battle, this offensive -- is the President willing to do anything it takes to win this particular battle, including increasing the American military role there?\nMR. EARNEST: Ron, the President has made the case that the success of this operation over the long term depends on a couple of things. The first is the ability of Iraqi security forces and Peshmerga forces to effectively coordinate in this effort. And that's what we have seen. They have already undertaken some very logistically challenging operations as they begin their advance toward Mosul. And we certainly would compliment them on their ability to coordinate their efforts.\nBut ultimately, Ron, in order for us to see the kind of sustained success in resolving the security situation inside of Mosul, we know that it has to be Iraqis fighting for their own country. And they have to be operating under the command and control of the Iraqi central government. And there's an important role the United States military can play to advance their efforts on the battlefield. We can carry out airstrikes in support of their operations. We can provide them equipment and expertise that can be used on the battlefield to make them more successful against ISIL targets. But ultimately, they have to be the ones on the front lines fighting for their own country. Because they also need to be the ones who are responsible for rebuilding that community once ISIL has been dislodged.\nQ: So it's some 5,000 troops. That's the top, that's the cap? That's the number that the American public can expect in Iraq during -- for how long?\nMR. EARNEST: Certainly for as long as President Obama is Commander-in-Chief. The role that will be given to our men and women, our servicemembers who are serving in Iraq, will be to, in some cases, provide training to Iraqi security forces, in other cases to provide advice and assistance to Iraqi security forces that are taking responsibility for the security situation in their own country.\nWe do maintain Special Operations forces that do have a unique counterterrorism capability that, in some cases, they may be called on to undertake raids, to go after high-value targets or to go after caches of information that could have significant intelligence value. There are obviously U.S. military fighter pilots who are carrying out operations, dropping bombs on ISIL targets.\nAll of that work is very dangerous, and all of that work is a testament to the bravery and skill of the American military, but it is also a testament to the strategy that President Obama believes is critical to our long-term success, which is that we need to build the capacity of security forces to fulfill the responsibility of fighting for their own country.\nQ: Just one on Aleppo. There's talk of another humanitarian pause, and I can anticipate your skepticism about that. At the debate the other night, Secretary Clinton again said that she supports the idea of safe havens in that area. In terms of the transition that's going on, the talks that are going on, is there ever any discussion between Secretary Clinton's people and the White House at that level about her views about something like that, a safe haven in Syria versus the current White House position of no safe haven? I know you're talking about a lot of things, but is there ever that kind of level discussion about those kinds of matters?\nMR. EARNEST: No, there's not. The fact is, the President and his national security team are working to formulate the kind of strategy that advances our interests against ISIL in Iraq and in Syria. And if Secretary Clinton is elected to be the next President of the United States, then she'll have an opportunity to participate in a transition process in which there will be extensive conversations about what our strategy has been. And then on January 20th, Secretary Clinton will take office as the President of the United States, and she can form her own national security team and implement the strategy that she believes best advances our interests.\nAll that is obviously contingent on the outcome of the election. But before the election, I would not anticipate that kind of consultation that you're asking about.\nQ: And it's still the President's position that this is not in America's national security interest to create this sort of safe haven, as it's been generally described?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I'll also point out that it's also the conclusion of the United States military that imposing a safe haven like this is not the most effective way to advance our interests in the region. And the President has routinely pushed his national security team to evaluate different options, to consider the likelihood that different strategies could be more successful, to look for ways to reinforce or ramp up our investment in some tactics that are yielding progress.\nThat's the kind of rigorous process that the President has been focused on, and that has allowed us to make a lot of important progress against ISIL, both in Iraq and in Syria. But thus far, the conclusion of the President's national security team is that the approach that we're pursuing now in trying to reduce violence in Aleppo through diplomacy and using our military might to focus on ISIL has advanced the security interests of the United States, has made the American people safer, has degraded ISIL. But we haven't yet seen the kind of reduction in violence in Syria that we'd like to see, because there continue to be too many innocent people in harm's way.\nQ: So his strategy is working.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there's no denying that we've made important progress.\nQ: But you just said that you haven't seen the reduction in violence that you want to see, so that aspect of it is not -- the strategy is not working in terms of that particular goal.\nMR. EARNEST: We haven't accomplished our goal yet. We have made important progress in driving ISIL out of about 50 percent of the previously populated territory that they previously controlled in Iraq. We've been able to drive them out of about 25 percent of the territory in Syria that they previously controlled, and this is a swath of territory in northern Syria that's about the size of the state of New Jersey.\nSo there have been important gains in dislodging ISIL from certain territory and reducing the violence in certain territory. But there are some populated areas, including in Aleppo, where we haven't seen the reduction in violence that we'd like to see yet.\nScott.\nQ: Josh, a minute ago you talked about -- you made a comparison of the tactics used in the Podesta hack and tactics that have been blamed on the Russian government. I just want to make sure I'm clear that the Homeland Security Secretary and the DNI talked about the attacks on the Democratic National Committee and others. Do you know something about who's responsible for the Podesta attacks?\nMR. EARNEST: The United States has not reached a formal determination about that, but I believe what the intelligence community and the Department of Homeland Security have said is that the kinds of tactics that we saw with regard to the malicious activity on Mr. Podesta's email account are similar to the kinds of tactics that we've seen used in other places. Obviously, the outlet is the same, but I'm not aware of any sort of formal determination that ascribes responsibility to one country or one actor with regard to the malicious activity in Mr. Podesta's email account.\nJeanne.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. On North Korea -- North Korea is continuing to threaten to launch ballistic missiles, and it would also devastate the White House. How do you address that?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm sorry, can you repeat the question one more time?\nQ: North Korea threatening with their ballistic missiles. It would also devastate the United States and the White House.\nMR. EARNEST: I see. Well, as we've discussed in here before, the President over the last several years has increased the U.S. military presence in the Asia Pacific to counter the ballistic missile threat from North Korea. And that includes the deployment of anti-ballistic missile capabilities in places like Japan and Alaska and Guam. There are Aegis-equipped U.S. naval vessels in the Pacific that can be used to protect the United States.\nAnd the President, his national security team and military leaders believe that sufficient resources have been deployed to protect the United States. We're looking to enhance the kind of cooperation that we already have with South Korea to locate a THAAD battery, an anti-ballistic missile battery in South Korea that would better protect the South Korean people, our allies in South Korea from the ballistic missile threat in North Korea. But we continue to be confident that the President's decision to deploy those military assets adequately protects the United States from that threat in North Korea.\nWhat I will say is those repeated threats and provocations from North Korea do have a destabilizing impact on the region. And our goal is to work with the rest of the international community to apply sufficient pressure to the North Korean regime so that they will abandon those destabilizing, provocative tactics and actually pursue an approach that's more consistent with their international obligations.\nQ: Yesterday, Secretary Kerry mentioned that U.S. and South Korea, 2+2 ministerial meeting. He said that the United States has the ability to devastate North Korea any time. Do you agree?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I certainly would not contradict Secretary Kerry. The United States maintains significant capabilities. But what we would like to see is a de-escalation in Northeast Asia and an end to the provocative rhetoric and the destabilizing actions like nuclear tests and missile tests that violate U.N. Security Council resolutions. That's the constructive path we would like to see North Korea pursue. And when I said \"we,\" I don't mean just the United States -- I mean the United States, South Korea, Japan, Russia and China all agree that that's what the North Korean government should do.\nJC.\nQ: I'd like to follow up on my colleague Chip's line of thought regarding an individual who was in the middle of all this divisiveness, as you call it, and rhetoric has come out very favorably and very powerfully, and that's the First Lady -- her very speeches, her surrogate opportunities for Secretary Clinton. Would she ever consider coming back into this White House on a future date, not as the First Lady but perhaps as the President?\nMR. EARNEST: No. (Laughter.)\nQ: That's it?\nMR. EARNEST: That's it.\nPam, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: The President's email was hacked last year on the unclassified server. Is there any concern that any of those emails could find their way onto WikiLeaks? And was the perpetrator ever identified there? And if so, is that the kind of thing that would provoke a proportionate response from the U.S.?\nMR. EARNEST: Pam, I've never discussed the President's email system, and so I've never been in a position of suggesting that somehow the integrity of the President's email system has been violated.\nWhat we have acknowledged is that there is a -- that there was an intrusion on White House email networks a year or two ago. I'm not aware that any public attribution for that malicious activity has been revealed by the intelligence community, but that is something that was obviously closely investigated by the intelligence community and by the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies.\nThe White House did take steps to enhance the safety and security of the email system here, but I don't have any response to discuss publicly.\nQ: And just on that OPM hack, did that -- was that ever determined publicly who was the perpetrator and whether that would require a proportionate response?\nMR. EARNEST: With regard to the breach of the OPM systems, I'm not aware that any public announcement was made about who was responsible for that intrusion, but we did talk at some length, in the context of that intrusion, about the kinds of capabilities and potential responses that the President could use with regard to that intrusion. But I don't have any insight to share about what public response -- or what sort of response was mobilized.\nQ: Is it that you haven't figured out who did it? Because you were pretty clear about North Korea did the Sony hack and Russia hacking to influence the elections, but we still don't know who, officially, who did that OPM hack.\nMR. EARNEST: When these breaches are reported, there is a careful investigation that's conducted by experts at DHS and other investigative agencies like the Department of Justice and the FBI. And, in the context of those investigations, what they do is they try to learn as much as possible about the individuals or organization or country that perpetrated the attack. They try to get insight into what vulnerabilities they were able to exploit, and try to determine what information was put at risk.\nWhat they also do is they also evaluate whether or not naming the malicious actor would advance the investigation or advance the interests of the United States. And that's why, on a case-by-case basis, the intelligence community and the Department of Homeland Security and law enforcement carefully evaluate whether or not naming a country or a criminal organization would be helpful.\nFor what decision they have reached or why they have that decision, I'd refer you to those investigative agencies. But what the President has tried to do is to prioritize the resources that are used by the United States government to protect the American people and to protect our interests in cyberspace. And there is a lot of work to be done because the United States is in a position where we're quite vulnerable. So much of the work that we do on a daily basis, not just in government but also in the private sector and in the lives of our daily citizens involves connectivity to the Internet, and that includes risks.\nAnd so that's why the United States government has been working aggressively. And it's why, frankly, we retain better defensive and offensive capabilities than any other country in the world. We need them, given how much our country and our economy and our national security relies on the Internet and our ability to use the Internet in the context of our daily lives.\nQ: Anything on the mass outing today online?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm sorry.\nQ: Is the White House aware of the mass Internet outage today?\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah, Justin asked me about it. So the DHS is tracking it.\nWhy don't we do the week ahead.\nOn Sunday, the President will travel to Las Vegas, Nevada to deliver remarks at an event for Hillary Clinton and for Senate candidate Catherine Cortez Masto.\nIn the evening, the President will travel to San Diego, California, where he will deliver remarks and take questions at a DCCC event.\nOn Monday, the President will deliver remarks at a Hillary Victory Fund reception. And then, in the afternoon, the President will travel to Los Angeles where he will participate in a taping of Jimmy Kimmel Live.\nIn the evening, the President will participate in a DNC and Hillary Victory Fund roundtable.\nOn Tuesday, the President will participate in a DSCC roundtable, and in the afternoon he'll come back to the White House.\nOn Wednesday and Thursday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.\nAnd then on Friday, the President will travel to Orlando, Florida, where he will participate in a Hillary For America event down there.\nHave a good weekend, everybody.\nEND 1:05 P.M.

{"author": "Michelle Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=120926", "text": "MRS. OBAMA: What's going on? I've got big old teleprompters right here but I'm not going to be bothered with that. (Laughter.) So whoever is operating the teleprompters, just let's forget it. (Laughter.)\nThis is our last workshop, because tonight we are working with BET to host our last, really, music event. And it's going to be a good one. Because we usually highlight a particular singer or a particular genre of music, but tonight it's going to be a little of everything -- a little gospel, a little soul, a little -- who knows who's going to be on the menu. (Laughter.)\nSo I am looking forward to it, but it means it's also the last time we're going to gather young people like you guys from all over the country to get a chance to see how you go from those seats to these seats up here. And this is really the best part of these days when we have the music here, is working with young people like all of you.\nAnd I want to take the time, again, to acknowledge and thank Bob Santelli from the Grammy Museum, who helps to make these activities possible. Bob, thank you so much. (Applause.)\nSo look who we have here with us! We have Michelle Williams. (Applause.) I don't even have to introduce these folks. Michelle Williams! (Applause.) And we have Yolanda Adams. Oh, my gosh! (Applause.)\nNow, these are award-winning artists who have done a number of things -- and the other thing, these are real -- these are \"sangers.\" (Laughter.) They \"sang.\" You know, there are people out there -- you know -- they \"sing.\" But these women, they \"sing.\" (Laughter.) You do. (Laughter.)\nMS. WILLIAMS: So do you!\nMRS. OBAMA: Well, no, I do many things, Michelle, but I do not sing. I don't sing. (Laughter.)\nAnd I'm so excited that they're here because you know them as the stars that they are, but they're just like me, they're just like you. Michelle grew up in Rockford, Illinois. I never realized you were that close to me. (Laughter.) We are Illinois girls. And through her life, she's had to deal with some tough stuff. She's had to deal with bullying in high school. She's had to overcome challenges.\nI don't know if you know about Yolanda -- and hopefully you guys will share these stories in more detail -- but Yolanda, before she was a singer, I understand you used to -- you held down a job as a teacher --\nMS. ADAMS: Yes, I did.\nMRS. OBAMA: -- and helped your mother take care of your younger siblings before you got into the business.\nSo, look, the point is that we all have some interesting challenges and obstacles that we face to get where we are today. But the difference between us and them, between you and success is not that you never fail, but it's how you recover from those failures -- is that you keep getting up time and time again. You figure out what you did wrong, and then you make it right. I say that to my kids every day.\nAnd that's really the point of these things. We want you to touch these stars and hear their stories, and understand that we all make mistakes, we all struggle, but perseverance is the key to anything you want to be in life. Whether you want to go into music, whether you want to be a lawyer, whether you want to be President of the United States, the bottom line for all of you is that you have got to get your education.\nAt the foundation of everything we have all done, it's understanding that education is key. That's the thing in your life that you have complete control over. You can go to school and focus -- not just be there, but actually put effort into it. Go to your classes. Study hard. Do your best. Get your homework done. Go to college.\nBecause if you do that, then you have all that you need, so that when you hit those bumps and those challenges, you have something concrete to fall back on. That is my wish, hope, instruction for all of you: Take your education seriously, okay? Always do that. Because I wouldn't be here today if it weren't for my education.\nSo with that, I'm going to turn it over to our panel. And I want to encourage you all not to be shy in this space. I know it's the State Room at the White House, it can be a little intimidating -- lots of lights and cameras and all that good stuff -- but this space is for you. It's intended for you to ask questions and raise your hand, and to be funny, and to dig deep, and to take advantage of the fact that you are sitting here in this room. And there are millions of other kids who would just die to be where you are. So do not waste this opportunity, okay? Don't waste it.\nAnd the other thing is, since you were one of the few chosen for this room, then it's your responsibility to pull somebody else along. When you leave here, who are you going to share this knowledge with? A younger cousin, a sister or brother, a neighbor? All of us are mentors. You're mentors right here and now. And one of the things I've always done throughout my life, I have always found that person, that group of people that I was going to reach my hand out and help bring them along with me. And you guys are in that position right now.\nSo think about how you're going to take this experience and carry it into your communities, into your families. Can you do that for me?\nAUDIENCE: Yes.\nMRS. OBAMA: All right. Well, I'm going to leave you to -- you all in good hands. And have fun. And thank you for coming to the White House. I love you all.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122592", "text": "Since the beginning of his Administration, President Obama has focused on creating an economy that works for every American. Under his leadership, our businesses have added 15.3 million jobs since early 2010, and the economy has seen the longest streak of job creation on record. However, more work needs to be done to make sure the benefits of the recovery are broadly shared. We must continue to adapt to forces of globalization and technology that deliver tremendous benefits but also pose challenges, including through increasing investment in effective job training. The jobs available today, and the jobs of the future, are higher-skill jobs that require more education and advanced skills.\nToday, the Department of Labor (DOL) is announcing the Administration's latest step to increase access to apprenticeship – using Fiscal Year 2016 funding for a new $50.5 million investment in State Expansion Grants to expand apprenticeships across the country in a diverse array of industry sectors. This initiative, called ApprenticeshipUSA, is part of the Administration's strategy to grow and diversify apprenticeship. Over the next 18 months, this effort will result in thousands of new apprenticeships in diverse industries, including health care, advanced manufacturing, and information technology, that offer workers not just jobs, but careers. These grants provide funding to 36 States and one territory to undertake new apprenticeship efforts, which will include efforts in both urban and rural communities. Projects will focus on helping a diverse set of workers – including women and minorities who have too often been left out of apprenticeship efforts in the past – enter into these in-demand fields.\nTo learn more about the efforts of all 37 winning ApprenticeshipUSA State Expansion grantees, click HERE.\nJob-driven apprenticeships are among the surest pathways to provide American workers from all backgrounds with the skills and knowledge they need to acquire good-paying jobs and grow the economy. In fact, 91 percent of apprentices are employed after completing their programs, with an average starting wage above $60,000. The return on investment for employers is also impressive — international studies suggest that for every dollar spent on apprenticeship, employers may get an average of $1.47 back in increased productivity and greater front-line innovation. As a result, the President has made expanding apprenticeship a priority for his Administration.\nSince the President's 2014 call to action, the U.S. has added more than 125,000 new apprenticeships, the largest increase in nearly a decade. And last year, the President signed into law the first-ever annual funding for apprenticeship programs in the Fiscal Year 2016 spending bill, following a bipartisan agreement based on the President's budget request.\nBut, we cannot carry on this work without continued funding, which the House Appropriations Committee's Labor-HHS-Education bill unfortunately fails to provide.\nIn contrast, the Senate Appropriations Committee provides strong support for apprenticeship, which we hope will be reflected in the final Fiscal Year 2017 spending bill. If this funding does not continue going forward, the 36 States and one territory who have received ApprenticeshipUSAState Expansion Grants will have to terminate their efforts in just 18 months. Similarly, the 14 organizations who were awarded $20.4 million in contracts to expand apprenticeship to new industries and reach historically underrepresented populations will see their funding dry up after one year. This would deprive thousands of Americans of the chance to participate in this life-changing training model. The President calls on Congress to continue its past support for apprenticeship in the final Fiscal Year 2017 spending bill.\nToday's announcement builds on a number of efforts that the Obama Administration has taken to prepare Americans for the jobs of the future. More information on the Administration's state-by-state investments in training can be found  HERE.\nInvesting More Than $50 Million to Support Smart State Strategies to Expand Apprenticeship\nThe grant awards announced today will build on the Administration's successful investments in state apprenticeship strategies. Recognizing Governors' unique ability to create smart statewide strategies to expand apprenticeship, DOL is awarding more than $50 million for ApprenticeshipUSAState Expansion Grants to help states integrate apprenticeship into their education and workforce systems; engage industry and other partners at scale to expand apprenticeship to new sectors and new populations; support state capacity to conduct outreach and work with employers to start new programs; provide support to promote greater inclusion and diversity in apprenticeship; and implement state innovations, incentives, and system reforms. By investing in state strategies for growing apprenticeship opportunities, these funds will help strengthen the foundation for the rapid and sustained expansion of quality apprenticeship nationwide. For example:\nColorado Department of Labor and Employment – Denver, CO\nThe Colorado Department of Labor and Employment was awarded a $1.8 million grant to fund the Grow the Middle Class project to expand youth and adult apprenticeships, and pre-apprenticeships for youth within school districts across the state, using the Swiss Apprenticeship model. Colorado will assist businesses in developing new apprenticeships and industry engagement and initiate a pilot program to recruit representatives from growth industries as champions to identify common competencies and standards for apprenticeships in key occupations.\nWashington State Department of Labor and Industries – Tumwater, WA\nThe Washington State Department of Labor and Industries was awarded $2.7 million to fund Project RAISE, a robust effort to coordinate state agency resources, recruit new employers, and advance Registered Apprenticeship opportunities for underrepresented populations. Project activities will include program modernization to increase the state's capacity to support apprenticeship expansion and engage new industry stakeholders. The project will register 600 apprentices in the industries of health care, education, construction, advanced manufacturing and the public sector, among others. Target populations include women, veterans, youth, low-income individuals, people with disabilities and people of color.\nConnecticut Department of Labor Office of Apprenticeship Training - Wethersfield, CT\nThe Connecticut Department of Labor Office of Apprenticeship Training (OAT) was awarded a $1.6 million grant to fund the Connecticut Apprenticeship Expansion Rx project, which targets the aerospace manufacturing and maintenance sector. The project will engage employers to increase new sponsors; and provide underrepresented populations, including women and dislocated and under employed individuals an opportunity to acquire industry required credentials. The project will serve 1,672 apprentices. Target industries include aerospace, aviation, energy, and the building trades. OAT and its partners will also develop multi-media resources as additional tools for sector outreach, a focus on stakeholder engagement, securing apprenticeship sponsors, fostering labor-management collaboration, and planning for increased strategic outreach.\nToday's announcement follows a $10.4 million investment DOL made earlier this year for ApprenticeshipUSA State Accelerator Grants, which provided 52 awards to states, territories, and the District of Columbia to develop strategic plans and build partnerships for apprenticeship expansion and diversification. Grantees also received support to develop comprehensive game plans for encouraging businesses to launch apprenticeship programs in a variety of industries including advanced manufacturing, health care, information technology, construction, and transportation.\nIn addition, DOL awarded $20.4 million last month in contracts to 14 national industry intermediaries and national equity partners. As part of the historic investment in apprenticeship, the contracts will support the growth of apprenticeship programs in an increasingly diverse set of industries, including healthcare, construction, transportation and logistics, manufacturing, and information and communications technology; and support efforts to boost the representation of traditionally underrepresented populations in apprenticeship programs. For example, the Washington Technology Industry Association will partner with leading technology companies to create a National Information and Communications Technology Apprenticeship Council (NICTAC) comprised of industry hiring partners. The NICTAC will provide underserved populations with access to apprenticeship opportunities in well-paying careers within the information and communications technology industry. More information on this project and other industry intermediary and national equity partner investments can be found HERE.\nBuilding on Success in Expanding Apprenticeship and Increasing Access to Job-Driven Training\nToday's announcement builds on the Obama Administration's previous efforts to increase access to apprenticeship and job-driven training to prepare workers for high-skill jobs, including:\n•      Investing an unprecedented $175 million in American Apprenticeship Grants. In September 2015, DOL announced $175 million in grants to 46 public-private partnerships between employers, organized labor, non-profits, local governments, and educational institutions that are expanding high-quality apprenticeships. The grantees are well on their way to creating more than 34,000 new apprentices in high-growth and high-tech industries including health care, information technology and advanced manufacturing over the next five years.\n•      Highlighting the value of apprenticeships through LEADERS. More than 180 employers, colleges, and labor organizations have signed on to be ApprenticeshipUSA LEADERS (Leaders of Excellence in Apprenticeship Development, Education and Research) by starting or expanding their own work-based learning programs and encouraging their peers to follow. Together, employers in the LEADERS program have pledged to create nearly 20,000 new apprenticeship positions.\n•      Expanding opportunities for apprentices to earn credit towards a degree. The Registered Apprenticeship-College Consortium (RACC) was launched to enable graduates of Registered Apprenticeship programs to turn their on-the-job and classroom training into college credits toward an associate or bachelor's degree. Since 2014, 290 colleges nationwide have joined the RACC.\nProviding American Workers with Skills Needed to Compete in the Global Economy\nIn addition, in January 2014, President Obama signed the Presidential Memorandum on Job-Driven Training for Workers, calling for an action plan within 180 days to make federal employment and training programs more job-driven. In July 2014, the Administration – with the leadership of Vice President Biden – released a plan to expand the number of pathways for Americans to gain the skills they need to get better, higher-paying jobs, and to increase access to those pathways. In addition, the Administration has taken a number of steps to support the American workforce and prepare it for the 21st century, as described below.\nMaking sure all Americans have a fair shot\nThe President has taken steps to expand and improve our efforts to re-connect workers who have been displaced by economic change back to the workforce system and into good jobs. Building on the best models of what works, these efforts have helped not only those affected by trade and globalization, but also by the aftermath of the Great Recession, by long-term changes in our energy industry, and in communities that have long suffered from economic isolation and inadequate education opportunities.\n•      Securing a six-year extension and expansion of Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) in June 2015, which provides vital job training, income support and other benefits to American workers displaced by the forces of globalization. Among other things, this extension improves on prior programs by supporting workers in the service sector and those affected by trade with countries with whom we do not have Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), including China and India. One year after the reauthorization, there have already been dramatic improvements resulting from the new legislation. The number of estimated workers currently eligible for benefits and services is over 100,000, which is almost double the number of workers eligible for TAA benefits and services in all of fiscal year 2015 under the older program. This includes approximately 18,000 workers now covered after their previously denied petitions were reconsidered under the new, more expansive law. In fiscal year 2015, 74 percent of TAA participants found new jobs, and over 92 percent retained their jobs.\n•      Helping the long-term unemployed get back to work and stay in the labor force, including through federal investments like the $170 million Ready to Work program, and through collaboration with business leaders to create a set of best practices for recruiting and hiring the long-term unemployed. In addition, DOL is providing robust reemployment services and eligibility assessments through $200 million in grants to all 50 states and territories to help prevent long-term unemployment and connect jobseekers to the labor market, while also ensuring that they continue to be eligible for unemployment benefits. Through Fiscal Year 2016, an estimated 1.3 million unemployed workers will be served. Recent research shows that when both eligibility assessments and reemployment services are provided seamlessly, reemployment outcomes for claimants improve and the duration of benefits is shorter.\n•      Launching the Partnerships for Opportunity and Workforce and Economic Revitalization (POWER) Initiative, an interagency effort to assist communities negatively impacted by changes in the coal industry and power sector with coordinated federal economic and workforce development resources that help communities diversify their economies and provide reemployment services and job training to connect workers to high-quality in-demand jobs. The initiative is led by the Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration and involves the coordinated efforts of ten Federal agencies.\n•      Helping low- to middle-skilled parents access training and affordable, quality childcare. As a part of the Administration's efforts to support working families, DOL awarded $54 million in grants to help low- to middle- skilled parents access the affordable, quality child care they need to earn an education, participate in training programs, and ultimately compete for better-paying jobs in emerging industries. Grants to 14 partnerships across the country were awarded as part of the Strengthening Working Families Initiative to strengthen and support public-private partnerships devoted to helping parents advance in their careers by bridging gaps between local workforce development and child care systems. These grants will facilitate access to training in a variety of industries, such as information technology, healthcare, advanced manufacturing, financial services, and educational services.\n•      Helping young people obtain skills and education to succeed in a knowledge-based economy through a $22 million investment in innovative employment demonstration programs in seven cities experiencing high levels of youth unemployment, poverty and crime (Baltimore, Camden, Detroit, Houston, Long Beach, North Charleston and North St. Louis). These projects are testing a range of models for working directly with employers to engage young people and prepare them for good jobs in in-demand industries through work-based training and supportive services.\nThe Administration has also invested $21 million to open doors for young Americans to kick-start their careers through Summer Jobs and Beyond grants. Building on the efforts of the My Brother's Keeper initiative, these grants help give young people their first meaningful work experience.\n•      Investing in job-driven training for Supplemental Nutrition and Assistance Program (SNAP) participants, including through the 2016 launch of SNAP to Skills – a first-of-its kind, peer-to-peer effort to help state agencies develop job-driven SNAP Employment and Training (SNAP E&T) programs that help participants find good jobs and reduce their need for SNAP. In addition, in March 2015, USDA competitively awarded $200 million to 10 states for 3-year pilot projects, as authorized by the 2014 Farm Bill, to test and evaluate a range of job-driven strategies, including intensive sector-based approaches and career pathways that prepare workers for specific occupations; career navigation and job readiness; work-based learning; and comprehensive assessment and intensive case management.\nScaling Up What Works\nThrough the course of the Vice President's review, the Administration identified three core problems: employers can't find enough skilled workers to grow their businesses; education and training programs need better information on what skills in-demand jobs require; and, hard-working Americans often are not sure what training to pursue and whether jobs will be waiting when they finish. By listening to employers, workers and training institutions utilizing innovative solutions, and working with Congress, we are implementing common-sense, evidence-based reforms that are helping people find and train for good jobs and ensuring that employers can find the skilled workers they need.\n•      Implementing the job-driven training checklist that reorients competitive job training grants to align with best practices based on elements that matter most to getting Americans into better jobs. To date, agencies have awarded over 15 competitive job-training grant programs that total more than $1.5 billion according to the checklist principles.\n•      Signing the bipartisan Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), the first reform of federal job training programs in nearly 20 years that reaches approximately 20 million Americans annually. WIOA improves business engagement, performance accountability, access, and alignment across job training programs.\nDoubling Down on Proven Strategies\nAn evaluation report promised in the 2014 Presidential Memorandum synthesized the elements of what works in job training, and the Administration is using this evidence base to direct limited federal resources into the most results-driven practices. Through administrative actions and by advancing budget proposals, we are using every tool at our disposal to expand successful models that put workers on the path to a good career with a middle-class wage.\n•      Investing in training for dislocated workers that follows employer needs in key sectors. DOL has awarded nearly $300 million in Sector Partnerships and Job-Driven Training grants focusing on training dislocated workers. Sector partnerships are consistently cited as one of the most effective strategies to better align education with employer needs and have been shown through randomized evaluations to lead to higher rates of employment and earnings.\n•      Supporting youth that have been involved in the juvenile justice system through $12 million in DOL and Department of Defense \"Job ChalleNGe\" grants that combine the National Guard Youth ChalleNGe Program's evidence-based elements, such as military-based discipline, education, life skills, and mentorship, with job-training and work experience.\n•      Helping public housing residents secure higher paying jobs and become self-sufficient through $62.9 million in Jobs Plus Program grants to support work readiness and connect public housing residents with employment, education and financial empowerment services. A research study found that public housing residents who participated in Jobs Plus saw a 14 percent increase in earned income and that these earnings remained higher seven years after exiting the program.\nPartnering With Employers, Communities, and Training Providers\nAs a complement to these federal efforts, the Administration is taking steps to partner outside of government—with employers, technology innovators, and educators—to develop job-driven workforce strategies. Through these partnerships, the Administration is helping to offer more Americans access to the knowledge and skills they need to pursue their educational and career goals while, at the same time, helping businesses grow by filling in-demand jobs with a skilled workforce.\n•      Launching TechHire, a community-based public-private initiative to train tech workers and empower Americans with the skills they need, including through nontraditional approaches like \"coding boot camps\" and high-quality online courses that can rapidly train workers for a well-paying job. Since March 2015, over 50 cities, counties, states and rural areas in partnership with nearly 1,000 employers have made commitments to this initiative. In support of some of the strategies employed by TechHire communities, DOL has awarded about $150 million in TechHire Partnership Grants to 39 public and private partnerships across 25 states.\n•      Addressing workforce shortages in the solar industry through the Department of Energy's SunShot program, which has invested $20 million in nine regional training hubs over five years and trained more than 1,000 instructors and 35,000 students in rooftop solar electricity and heating installation through partnerships with 533 community colleges, labor union apprenticeship programs, and other institutions.\n•      Launching the public-private Upskill initiative to help low-skilled workers build the skills they need to advance into high-paying roles, even if they do not have a higher education. Over 100,000 workers have received training as a result of upskilling efforts since April 2015.\n•      Investing $2 billion in the Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training (TAACCCT) grant program that has created or enhanced 2,500 in-demand education and training programs at community colleges in all 50 states. To date, nearly 300,000 participants have enrolled in these programs, earning 160,000 credentials. Forty-four states received grants that supported state-wide system change by including all or most community colleges in the state.\n•      Launching of New Communities that Work Partnership (CTWP). The Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration is supporting seven regional sites across the country to help equip American workers with the skills needed for 21st century jobs and accelerate employer-led workforce development and training efforts. One of the most effective ways to scale up what works is to create a community of practice and a playbook that allows communities to learn from one another.\n•      Deepening Relationships with Businesses to Recruit and Hire Veterans. The Veterans' Employment and Training Service (VETS) within DOL established an employer outreach team that encourages employment commitments from national and regional employers seeking to hire veterans. VETS expanded the outreach team to connect over 600 employers ranging from small businesses to Fortune 500 companies.", "timestamp": "2016-10-21", "title": "Fact Sheet: Investing More Than $50 Million through ApprenticeshipUSA to Expand Proven Pathways into the Middle Class"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122633", "text": "Last week, President Obama wrote about the progress we as a Nation have made over the past 8 years to ensure our space program continues to inspire generations of students and serve as a leading source of innovation in our country. Central to this work has been developing new, innovative technologies that continue to pioneer new frontiers in space and test the bounds of knowledge and discovery.\nToday, astronauts Scott and Mark Kelly are visiting the White House to talk to the President about just these types of advances. One critical area for technology development is making satellites more affordable, adaptable, and adept at providing the sorts of real-time information that will help advance knowledge out in space and right here at home.\nOver the past several years, commercial companies, government agencies, university researchers, and national labs have demonstrated the capability of small satellites (\"smallsats\") and constellations of smallsats to support important commercial, civilian, and national-security applications. These applications include providing high-speed Internet connectivity to remote rural communities and transforming humanity's understanding of the world around us with continuously updated imagery of the entire planet.\nTraditional large satellites, which can weigh tens of thousands of pounds and be as large as a school bus, provide important capabilities for communications, remote sensing, and science, but they typically cost hundreds of millions of dollars per satellite and often take years to build and launch. Because of the massive investment required to build, launch, operate, and insure larger satellites, for most of the past half-century, only governments and large corporations have had the resources necessary to operate in their own satellites in space.\nThe recent advent of smallsats, spacecraft that weigh anywhere from an ounce to as much as a few hundred pounds, has upended that status quo. The same advances in electronics and communications technologies that enabled smartphones and put significant computing power in the palm of everyone's hand are allowing scientists and engineers to design smallsats and coordinated networks of multiple smallsats (known as \"smallsat constellations\") that deliver novel and diverse capabilities from orbit.\nThese capabilities can sometimes be delivered at a fraction of the cost and time of legacy satellite systems. Scientists and engineers can more quickly test their systems on orbit, allowing them to devise new, better systems more quickly, shortening the cycle of innovation and finally bringing \"Moore's Law\" to space.\nFor all of these reasons, today, the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) is announcing the \"Harnessing the Small Satellite Revolution\" initiative. Working with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Department of Defense, the Department of Commerce, and other Federal agencies, OSTP has identified the following opportunities to promote and support both government and private use of small satellites for remote sensing, communications, science, and the exploration of space. OSTP will continue to work with Federal agencies to identify additional steps to foster innovation in the development and use of smallsat technologies.\n•      NASA will propose up to $30 million to support data buys for smallsats, including up to $25 million to support data buys derived and purchased from non-governmental small spacecraft constellations and $5 million to advance small spacecraft constellation technologies. In the near-term, NASA intends to purchase Earth Science observation data, such as (but not restricted to)\nmoderate-resolution land imaging and radio occultation data. The agency is also committing to a comprehensive review of space missions to determine which science and exploration needs could be met more effectively using smallsat technologies.\n•      NASA will establish a Small Spacecraft Virtual Institute at Ames Research Center in the heart of Silicon Valley early in 2017. The Virtual Institute will provide a \"one-stop shop\" for technical knowledge in the rapidly burgeoning small spacecraft technology fields. It will also act within the agency to promote relevant programs, guidance, opportunities, and best practices, as well as share lessons learned on smallsat missions. To take full advantage of the rapid iteration cycles associated with smallsats, NASA is also working to standardize its management practices associated with smallsat missions to reduce the administrative burdens associated with them in comparison to larger, more traditional space missions.\n•      The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) has awarded a $20 million contract to Planet, a startup currently building out a constellation of imagery smallsats in low earth orbit. This allows NGA to obtain imagery of at least 85 percent of the Earth's landmass every 15 days from Planet. The imagery has many operational uses, including environmental monitoring, augmenting higher resolution capabilities, change detection, and answering intelligence questions.\n•      NGA is partnering with the General Services Administration to develop an efficient, single point to access and purchase commercially-provided imagery data, analytical capabilities, and services. This effort, labeled the Commercial Initiative to Buy Operationally Responsive GEOINT (CIBORG), will connect with trusted commercial sources and match products to intelligence-user needs and match the right capability against the right intelligence problem. CIBORG is also designed to grow into a \"good for Government\" initiative, allowing other U.S. government users to order and share data through this process.\n•      The Department of Commerce is elevating the role of the Office of Space Commerce to reflect the growing importance of commercial space as a driver of economic growth, productivity, and job creation. This will enable the Office's Director to advise the Secretary of Commerce on commercial space issues and the office to coordinate policy on critical issues such as licensing, export controls, export promotion, and open data. The Director's statutory role is to act as an advocate and ombudsman for the commercial space industry within the Federal government, and the Director will work with Federal agencies to help them take full advantage of the new capabilities (including smallsats, constellations of smallsats, dedicated launch capability for smallsats, and data analytics) that are being developed by the private sector.\n•      Last month, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) awarded the first Commercial Weather Data Pilot program contracts to smallsat- constellation operators GeoOptics, Inc. and Spire Global, Inc. to provide space- based, radio-occultation data for the purpose of demonstrating data quality and potential value to NOAA's weather forecasts and warnings.\n•      The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) is releasing satellite datasets as part of two prize-driven challenges to achieve breakthroughs in the analysis of overhead imagery. The Multi-View Stereo 3D Mapping Challenge invites researchers and entrepreneurs to generate accurate 3D point clouds from multi-view satellite imagery, while the Functional Map of the World Challenge will invite solvers to identify building functions and land use.\nThese and other actions hold tremendous promise to capture the potential of the small satellite revolution, and ultimately to advance our knowledge and understanding of our own world and the far reaches of space.", "timestamp": "2016-10-21", "title": "Fact Sheet: Harnessing the Small Satellite Revolution to Promote Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Space"}

Well, this is a treat for me, at the end of a long week, to be able to visit with a couple of friends, but also, I believe, American heroes. In particular, I want to say thank you, on behalf of the American people, to Scott Kelly.\nAs some of you know, a while back, Scott completed what was the longest period of time that any U.S. astronaut has ever spent in space: almost a year. And what made this so important was not just to break a record, it gave us an opportunity to learn how Scott, as an astronaut, is impacted by lengthy stays like that. And we've got somebody to compare him to: his twin brother Mark, also an astronaut. [Laughter]\nSo, as a consequence, what we were able to learn is how does the body adapt, what kinds of physiological impacts; psychologically, from what I understand from Scott, he was pretty good. But all this allows us to start thinking about long-term, manned space flight.\nAnd as I announced recently, our goal—our next goal—not our ultimate goal, but our next goal is to get to Mars. And obviously, we've got a lot of work to do technologically to figure out how to get there, what kinds of spacecrafts allow us to do that most effectively. But if we're going to do a manned flight, then one of the keys is making sure that our astronauts who are going out into space for that long period of time are also then able to come back: what kinds of environments do we need to create for them, what are the biological sciences and other elements that will allow for a successful mission?\nSo we are extraordinarily grateful to Scott for the sacrifices that he's made. He did all kinds of science experimenting up there that is over my head and I won't even try to explain, but the data, the knowledge that we've accumulated from his incredible adventure is something that is going to serve us in good stead as we continue to accelerate and advance our forays into space.\nAs everybody knows, I'm a big space fan, and Charles Bolden, another ex-astronaut, along with my chief science adviser, John Holdren, have been working closely with me to maximize the investments that we make, to try to encourage Congress to work with us so that that final frontier is something that continues to inspire, continues to motivate the imaginations of young people, and creates enormous spillover effects, because when we learn about space, we're also learning about ourselves, and ultimately, we're learning about technologies that can make a difference in terms of our day-to-day lives.\nOne last point I'd make is, Scott was sharing with me what the planet looks like from up above and how much of a perspective it gives on the need for us to preserve this planet. And so I'm going to have just a couple more remarks, but I thought this would maybe be a good time, Scott, for you just to share with everybody else what you just shared with me in terms of what it means when you're seeing day in and day out our planet Earth. Cmdr. Kelly. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, sir, for having us here today, and thanks for supporting NASA in your new initiative for us to start really thinking hard about going to Mars. I think that's our next very worthy goal in space.\nAnd what the President is referring to is, being in space for a whole year, you get this perspective of seeing the Earth through changing seasons and different lighting conditions. And when I was in space for shorter periods of time, I would often think, well, maybe the Earth is just looking like that because it's a weather pattern or it's not how it always appears throughout the year.\nBut seeing places like China and India and the pollution that exists there almost all the time is quite shocking. And there was one day last summer, the summer of 2015, when I was in space, I saw the eastern side of China, and it was perfectly clear. And I'd never seen that before in my—in all of my time in space, and I'd spent well over a year in space, total, at that point. And I could see all these cities that are—there's, like, over 200 cities in that part of China, with over a million people. And it was at dusk, and I could just, for the very first time, I was able to see them, and it was quite shocking.\nI didn't really understand it until the next day I heard that the Chinese Government had turned off a lot of the coal-producing power plants, stopped the cars from running in that part of the country for this national holiday, and the sky had completely cleared.\nSo it's interesting to see just how much of a negative impact we have on the environment, but also how quickly we can have a positive impact on it if we decide to do something—not to mention the atmosphere is very, very thin and scary looking when you see it from space.\nThe President. It's a good reminder that we need to do everything we can to preserve this place we call home.\nBecause of people like Scott and Mark, we are continuing to see young people inspired to get into science, math, engineering, technology: what we call STEM. As many of you know, we've been really trying to emphasis STEM education, including hosting a White House Science Fair so that the incredible achievements of our best young minds are celebrated.\nAt the last one, a 9-year-old budding scientist said to me, you need a kids' science advisory group so that you're getting our perspective about what's interesting to us and how you should be thinking about teaching science and getting kids excited about science. And then, I thought, that's why you're smarter than me. [Laughter]\nSo we, in fact, have formed a science advisory group, which is meeting as we speak. After we finish here, we're going to go and talk to them, because I suspect that there are going to be some of those young people in the Roosevelt Room who are going to be the ones to figure out how we not just get to Mars, but colonize Mars and go beyond. They're the ones who are going to figuring out these technologies. But they will be building off the incredible work of people like Scott Kelly and Mark Kelly.\nAnd my last point, I want to say thank you to Mark Kelly. With his wife Gabby Giffords, they have been doing incredible work around making sure that, in addition to taking care of the planet and understanding our environment, that we're also thinking smartly about gun safety and the preventable deaths that bring so much tragedy and hardship to so many people's lives.\nMy understanding is, Gabby right now is on a 42-day bus trip.\nCapt. Kelly. Forty-two day, 42 cities. The President. Forty-two days and 42 cities——\nCapt. Kelly. Bus trip.\nThe President. ——bus trip, and just talking about the importance of us getting together in a bipartisan way to do something about gun safety.\nCapt. Kelly. Yes, sir.\nThe President. And so, in addition to doing cool stuff in space, they're also helping us think smartly about how to make our country better on a day-to-day basis. So we're so glad she's doing well. We want to thank both of them.\nAt some other time, if you haven't already heard, you should get some stories from Scott about what it's like after you've been in space for almost a year, and then you come down and you're walking around. My understanding is that his head got a little larger—[laughter].\nCapt. Kelly. A lot larger.\nThe President. ——measurably so. And we don't just mean ego. [Laughter] But apparently, it's back to normal size. I wanted to see him right away, but folks thought it might be a little scary. [Laughter]\nSo, all right? Thank you, guys.\nMark Twain Prize for American Humor Recipient Actor William J. Murray\nQ. Mr. President. Did you meet with Bill Murray?\nThe President. Absolutely. He was wearing a Cubs jacket which, for a White Sox fan, is a little troubling. [Laughter]\nThank you, guys.

Embodying the notion that the ability to pursue a higher education should be an opportunity available to all, rather than a privilege for a few, these campuses were built from a determination to widely and profoundly expand the reach of our country's promise. During National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week, we celebrate this aspiration and reaffirm our support for HBCUs.\nRendered possible by the extraordinary sacrifices and commitment of women and men who resolved to make real and enduring the new birth of freedom that echoed across our country following the end of the Civil War, the rise of these proud institutions marked the beginning of a new chapter in our national narrative. With each generation, HBCUs have shaped America for the better in indelible ways. From a pastor who would give voice to equality's cause to the great-grandson of a slave who would reach the bench of our highest court; from pioneers of medical and scientific breakthroughs to creators of innovative and prosperous businesses; from artists who expand the boundaries of expression to historians who illuminate our past and help us write our future, so much of the progress that has come to define America has been carried forward by graduates, academics, and leaders of these colleges and universities.\nSince I took office, my Administration has focused on expanding opportunity and opening doors of higher education for more people. We have increased Pell Grants, expanded student loan assistance going directly to students, cut taxes for those paying tuition, allowed students to cap their Federal loan payments at 10 percent of their income, and created the College Scorecard to assist prospective students in understanding their options for pursuing a higher education. Today, more Americans are earning a degree in post-secondary education than ever before, and HBCUs are playing an important role. In the 6 years since I signed an Executive Order bolstering the White House Initiative on HBCUs, we have helped ensure that more students have greater opportunities and that these institutions can benefit from a fuller range of Federal programs and assistance. HBCUs and community colleges help build our Nation's economy and strengthen the middle class, which is why I am working to make 2 years of community college free for hardworking students across our country through America's College Promise—a proposal that also helps 4-year HBCUs provide more low-income students with up to 2 years of college for free or at reduced tuition.\nThis week, we recognize the ways in which HBCUs are central to our experience as a Nation and recommit ourselves to the work that lies ahead. Let us honor the spirit in which these institutions were constructed by reaffirming the enduring truths at their core, and let us continue endeavoring to ensure all people have the chance to access higher education and secure ever greater opportunity.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 23 through October 29, 2016, as National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week. I call upon educators, public officials, professional organizations, corporations, and all Americans to observe this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities that acknowledge the countless contributions these institutions and their alumni have made to our country.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-10-21", "title": "Proclamation 9527—National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week, 2016"}

On United Nations Day, we reflect on the progress we have made in the time since, resolve to carry this progress forward, and reaffirm our commitment to international cooperation rooted in the rights and responsibilities of nations across the globe.\nToday, because of the international order the United Nations has helped anchor for more than seven decades, we live in a global community that, together, has overcome the greatest financial crisis of our time, lifted billions of people out of poverty, promoted the emergence of more democracies, and taken meaningful steps toward leaving our children with a world that is safer, cleaner, and more stable. Yet the same forces of integration that have helped forge closer ties and stronger partnerships among the world's nations also have exposed deep fault lines that we must address. In too many places around the world, perpetrators of atrocities go unpunished and those who violate international law face no consequences. Climate change remains a serious threat—even after we officially crossed the threshold for the Paris Agreement to take effect earlier this month. Too many governments still silence journalists, quash dissent, and censor vital flows of information. And in camps and cities around the world, families live as refugees, surviving on aid and the compassion of others. These issues present crises of our shared security and challenges to our international system in which all nations must share in our collective responsibilities. Our world is too small, and our destinies too intertwined, for us not to see ourselves in one another. By upholding the values upon which the United Nations was founded—pluralism, diversity, human rights, and togetherness—we can ensure we pass these tests of our common humanity. And by continuing to build a more capable and effective United Nations, we strengthen the world's capacity to respond to global crises, keep peace in fragile societies, and tackle unprecedented humanitarian challenges.\nThe international community relies on the United Nations today more than ever before. Now in its eighth decade, this institution—and those selfless individuals who devote their lives to sustaining it—is vital to our mission of shaping a better world: one defined by cooperation over confrontation, a shared sense of purpose, and the understanding that the future of a child in America is inextricably linked to that of a child in Afghanistan. On this day, let us pay tribute to the staff of the United Nations, particularly the more than 100,000 uniformed personnel serving in peacekeeping missions, for their selfless service to the cause of promoting international peace and prosperity, and as citizens of the world, let us renew our shared commitment to forging a brighter tomorrow for all.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 24, 2016, as United Nations Day. I urge the Governors of the 50 States, and the officials of all other areas under the flag of the United States, to observe United Nations -Day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.

Well, you can tell what kind of night this is. That was not the usual ruffles and flourishes. [Laughter] That was not John Philip Sousa right there. [Laughter] This must be a BET event.\nSo hello, everybody!\nAudience members. Hello!\nThe President. Welcome to the White House.\nAudience member. We love you!\nThe President. I love you back. That's why we're having this concert. [Laughter]\nSo, over the past 8 years, Michelle and I have set aside nights like this to honor and celebrate the music that has shaped America. We've had classical. We've had country. We've had blues. We've had Broadway, gospel, Motown, Latin, and jazz. We've had Bob Dylan, and we've had Jennifer Hudson; Gloria Estefan and Los Lobos; Aretha, Patti, Smokey—it's true. I've had Paul McCartney singing \"Michelle\" to Michelle. [Laughter] And Stevie singing \"Happy Birthday.\" We've had Buddy Guy and Mick Jagger getting me to sing \"Sweet Home Chicago\" one night, a little off key. [Laughter]\nSo this has become one of our favorite traditions. And it's with a little bit of bittersweetness that this is our final musical evening as President and First Lady.\nAudience members. Aww!\nThe President. I know. [Laughter] It's going to be all right. [Laughter] Going to be all right.\nAnd I want to thank BET for helping us out tonight to throw a great party.\nSo this evening, instead of focusing on a particular theme or genre, we decided to just invite some outstanding artists to help us celebrate. And I will be honest, this is one of the perks of the job that we'll miss most, along with Air Force One. [Laughter] And Marine One. [Laughter] But if you can just call up Usher and say, \"Hey, come on over to my house and sing with us\"—[laughter]—or call up Janelle Monáe and say, \"You know what, we need a little extra something here, can you\"—[laughter]—it doesn't get any better than that.\nAlthough I do want to make one thing clear. This event may be called \"Love and Happiness,\" but, much to, I know, your sadness or regret, I will not be singing Al Green this evening. [Laughter] Won't do it. [Laughter]\nNow, it's no secret that Michelle and I love music, and we tried to share our passion with the rest of the country. But it is important to note we are not the first occupants of this house to fill it with music. Ever since 1801, when the U.S. Marine Band played the first reception hosted by John and Abigail Adams, live performances have always been a part of life at the White House. And by the way, another perk that I will really miss: our amazing Marine Band. They are—[applause]. Not only can they play anything, and I mean anything—I've seen them play with Yo-Yo Ma and then jam with B.B. King—but they're also Active Duty. So they are not just astounding musicians, but they're also protecting this country. And Michelle and I just love them. We cannot thank them enough for their outstanding work.\nAnyway, you might walk around the White House and see the fancy chandeliers and the paintings of George and Martha, and you may think that the musical performances before we got here were a little stuffy. Now, it's true they weren't quite like our musical events. [Laughter] But the truth is that throughout history, the White House has celebrated the new and the innovative. It's even been a little edgy once in a while.\nPresident Chester A. Arthur was ahead of his time in inviting the all-Black Fisk Jubilee Singers, and their performance moved him to tears. Teddy Roosevelt welcomed Scott Joplin, because his daughter wanted to hear \"that new jazz.\" And then, guests of the Kennedys apparently did the twist in the East Room, which may not sound like a big deal to you, but that was sort of the twerking of their time. [Laughter] It was bold. [Laughter] There will also be no twerking tonight—[laughter]—at least not by me. [Laughter] I don't know about Usher. [Laughter]\nBut it makes sense because this is the people's house, and it ought to reflect the amazing diversity, and the imagination, and the incredible ingenuity that defines the American people. And while much of the music that you will hear this evening—gospel, R&B, rap—is rooted in the African American experience, it's not just Black music. This is an essential part of the American experience. It's a mirror to who we are and a reminder of who we can be.\nThat's what American music is all about. And generations from now, I hope it's the story that the White House will continue to tell.\nSo with that, I'm going to stop talking. Are you ready to get started?\nAudience members. Yes!\nThe President. If so, give it up for our first performer, the amazing, the lovely Jill Scott!", "timestamp": "2016-10-21", "title": "Remarks at BET's \"Love and Happiness: A Musical Experience\""}

As you know, Tim has been doing the most amazing job around the country hitting every state multiple times along with Ann, his extraordinary wife, who has been campaigning tirelessly on her own as well.\nSo we don't get a lot of chance to actually gather because we want to cover more ground together. But today was a real opportunity for us.\nI just want to make two quick points. First, as we are traveling in the last 17 days, we are going to be emphasizing the importance of electing democrats down ballot.\nAnd in particular, as I said today, we are strongly supportive of Katie Mcginty in her race for the senate. We will be, I think, meeting up with her in Philadelphia tonight. So we will have a chance to do that with her. I will be doing the same as we go from state to state, as will Tim.\nThe other point is today, we are making our closing arguments. We are talking about what is at stake in the election we are drawing contrasts, but we are giving people something to vote for, not just against.\nAnd I saw where our opponent Donald Trump went to Gettysburg, one of the most extraordinary places in American history, and basically said, if he's president, he will spend his time suing women who have made charges against him based on his behavior.\nTim and I are going to keep talking about what we want to do if we are given the great honor of serving as president and vice president. As we said in the book, \"Stronger To-gether\" we have very specific plans.\nAnd we are going to get together after the election and do everything possible to be prepared on January 20th to start doing the business of the American people.\nReporter: Secretary Clinton, Trump today also suggested that democrats or the Clinton campaign were behind these women coming forward and making these accusations. What do you have to say to that?\nSecretary Clinton: That is just not accurate.\nReporter: We have started to hear some republicans say that it if you win, it will not be because American voters have endorsed your platform, but rather that they have rejected Trumps. How would you respond to that, and would that get in the way of an effort to bring the country back together, and have a mandate for the presidency?\nSecretary Clinton: Well clearly we are going to spend the next 17 days making the case to persuade as many Americans as possible across our country to vote for Tim and me.\nWe have close elections in America. You can go back and check that out for the last 4, 6, 8 of them. it is not unusual that the election would be close.\nSo we are not taking anything for granted. We are working our hearts out and covering as much ground.\nWe have great events planned. We have great surrogates coming out to support us that are both campaigning with us and campaigning on their own to try to convince as many people as possible to go vote.\nAs i said in pittsburgh, we are seeing some really encouraging signs about the turnout. the 200 million voter registration mark is huge, it's never been reached before. 50 million as the best estimate being young people is so encouraging.\nAnd then what we are seeing from early vote returns, I think we are over 4 million already. So I am not going to speculate about the outcome of the election, people know what Tim and I want to do. We have been very clear about that. We've laid it out in every way that we could in every different kind of forum. And I am going to be reaching out to people on the other side of the aisle, to everybody that will possibly come together with us.\nReporter: Do you see any of the outreach you have done to republicans who have rejected Donald Trump as carrying over into your potential administration? And how would fishers in the party impact some of those big items on your agenda, particularly immigration?\nSecretary Clinton: Amy, I am very encouraged by what I think we can get accomplished. I came into the senate in 2000 as you know, and I made it clear from the beginning that I wanted work with people.\nI didn't have any expectations about being treated any differently than anybody else. And I think you can go back and look at the record that I compiled by working with practically every republican I served with.\nI think, last time we had it counted, 400 bills have my name on them either as a sponsor or cosponsor. You don't get that done unless you work with folks on the other side.\nSo I have a record of doing that, not just in the senate, but as first lady and secretary of state. And people know that. And we will begin to get to work right away and reach out to everybody that we can possibly touch to start talking about what we can do together. And I think there is a big agenda where we can find common ground.\nReporter: Madam Secretary, have you thought at all about who you might put in your cabinet if you win?\nClinton: No I really haven't. I am a little superstitious about that. We have got a transition operation going, and I haven't really paid much attention to it yet because I want to focus on what our first task is, and that is convincing as many Americans as possible to give us the chance to serve.\nReporter: What kind of qualities are you looking for—\nSecretary Clinton: I am not going to talk anymore about that.\nReporter: I was wondering, you touched on it earlier at the event, but what would your response be to trump's assertion that there is a vast media conspiracy against him supporting your campaign?\nSecretary Clinton: You know, I debated him for 4.5 hours. I am not even going to think about responding to him anymore.\nI will let the American people think about what he offers and what we offer. He can say whatever he wants and he can run his campaign however he wants to. He can go off on tangents, he can go to Gettysburg and say he's going to sue women who have made accusations against him.\nI am going to keep talking about what we want to do, what we think the country de-serves from the next president and vice president. And actually when it comes right down to it, that is what I think people end up voting on. Thank you all very much.\nReporter: Secretary Clinton, are you truly concerned that Donald trump would try to throw you in jail if he were elected? And one other issue, there was a Wikileaks email in which one of you top aids said that a Clinton Foundation conference, that's now being labeled by some of your critics as a pay to play scheme, was a mess of your own making. Would you comment on that as well?\nSecretary Clinton: No, I have nothing to say about Wikileaks, other than I think we should all be concerned about what the Russians are trying to do to our election and using Wikileaks very blatantly to try to influence the outcome of the election. I have no concerns about the first question whatsoever.\"", "timestamp": "2016-10-22", "title": "Remarks to the Press Aboard the Campaign Plane in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}
{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "note": "Remarks as delivered. Both Secretary Clinton and Tim Kaine were introduced by Dan and Pat Rooney, members of the Rooney family who are known for immigrating from Ireland in the 1880s and forming roots in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. They are also known for having extensive connections within the political, athletic, and entertainment communities.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119501", "text": "Secretary Clinton: \"Thank you! Thank you all so much!\nWow. It is so great to be back here in Pittsburgh.\nI do not think it gets any better than to be accompanied out onto the stage by Dan and Pat Rooney.\nI am a big admirer of the Rooney family and I was so honored to serve with Dan when he was our ambassador to Ireland.\nThe Rooney family commitment to Pittsburgh is really extraordinary, and it's not just the amazing commitment to the Stealers. As special as that is, but to their roots, what they believe in, their values, and their deep concern for future generations. So I am incredibly humbled to be supported by Dan and Pat and the Rooney family. It means a great deal to both Tim and me.\nI also want to thank congressman Mike Doyle who is here with us. Allegheny and county executive Richard Fitzgerald who is here. Mayor Bill Peduto. Mayor John Federman. Pennsylvania attorney general Bruce Beemer. And all the other elected officials, it means a lot for you to be here with us. If all goes well in 17 days, we are looking forward to working with you on behalf of Pittsburgh.\nSome of you know that I have a special place in my heart for Pennsylvania, and I am excited about helping, in any way that we can, for Pittsburgh, Allegheny county, and western Pennsylvania to keep moving forward with confidence and optimism about what is possible for the future we want to create together. I am thrilled to be here with Tim Kaine.\nI asked him to be my running mate because I knew he would be one of the smartest, toughest, most qualified vice presidents we have ever had. And I also knew he had never lost an election.\nI kind of figured that might rub off on me a little bit. Now that I have gotten to spend more time with him, and with his wonderful wife Anne and their family, I am even more confident that he will be such an extraordinary leader for our country. He is not just smart, tough and qualified, Tim Kaine is as good and decent a person as you will ever meet.\nI am deeply honored to have him by my side in this campaign. Tim and I are excited by all of the energy and enthusiasm we are seeing across the country, and particularly here in Pennsylvania.\nBut both of us, unlike our opponent, do not believe we can do this alone. We believe that we are going to do this by working with all of you. And that we are going to come together in the next 17 days and convince everybody you can to get out and vote because whatever issue you care about, it's going to be on the ballot. It may not be listed, but it will be on the ballot.\nWhether you care about new, good jobs with a rising incomes or you care about better education or you care about what we can do to get the cost of prescription drugs down. What ever it is you care about, it is literally going to be on that ballot.\nNow, my name and Tim's name may be the ones on the ballot, but we are going to be representing everything that we can do that you hope for our country. And we're going to need help doing that after the election, and that is why I hope you will do everything you can to elect Katie Mcginty, your next senator.\nYou know, Katie is the daughter of a Philadelphia police officer. I think she is one of 10 children, right? One of 10 children. She has devoted her professional life to protecting working families. I have known her now for more than 20 years, when she was really young, and I have seen that same can-do spirit. She just gets up every day, and asks what can she do to fight for healthier neighborhoods, to keep our kids and healthy, to fight for cleaner air and cleaner water, to help people make the most out of their own lives.\nNow she is running for the senate, because like Tim and I, she believes our economy should work for everyone, not just those at the top.\nKatie is exactly the kind of partner we need in the senate. But more importantly, she is exactly the kind of senator that Pittsburgh and western Pennsylvania needs in the senate. We have got to get things done for the people of Pennsylvania and America, and Katie will help us break through the gridlock, actually make a difference in people's lives, help us create more good jobs with rising incomes, guarantee equal pay for women, defending planned parenthood.\nAnd I think it is pretty clear when you look at Katie's opponent -- he still refuses to stand up to Donald Trump.\nA lot of republicans have. They have had the grit to stand up and say 'he does not represent me'.\nBut Pat Toomey heard Donald attack a grieving gold star family who lost their son in Iraq. He heard Donald called Mexican immigrants rapists, he heard him say terrible things about women. He heard him spread the lie that our first black president wasn't really born in America -- how much more does Pat Toomey need to hear? If he doesn't have the courage to stand up to Donald Trump after all this, then can you be sure he will stand up for you when it counts against powerful interests?\nSo, you know, when I look at this, I'm thinking to myself, we have work to do in Washington. And I know it's not easy. I understand we have some real challenges. I believe we can do it. I would not be standing here, Tim would not be with me -- but we need people in Washington who put you first, who get up every day thinking about middle-class families, who worry about where you are going to get the money to send your kids to college, how you are going to take care of your mom or dad because they are failing and what are you going to do for them? How are you going to deal with all of the challenges? That is what I try to do my entire life. That is who you should be electing, people who care about you, your families, your children.\nNow, as Tim said, he asked if any of you watched the debate on Wednesday. Well, I will tell you, that was the third and last time I will ever have to debate Donald Trump.\nI mean, think about this, I have now spent 4 and a half hours on stage with Donald, proving once again I have the stamina to be President and commander in chief.\nAnd after every one of those debates, people have said, how did you do that? And really, you just have to be of good cheer when you find yourself in a situation like that. You are in front of 50, 60, 70, 80 million people. So, no matter what he would say, I just kept thinking of all the people I have met throughout this campaign. Just early today I've met Henry over there. Henry is on top of his dad's shoulders, and Henry gave me a note saying he hoped I would be president, and you know, I really want to be president for all of the kids in America to do everything I can to help you.\nYou know, I also did have a chance to talk about some of the important concerns people have shared with me. From the first day I started this campaign back in april 2015, people have been telling me what is on their minds, and it is one of the greatest honors.\nYou know, sometimes it is just fleeting. I will be in a coffee shop shaking hands or I will come down and shake hands on a rope line, just running into somebody. And that person, that man or woman or that young person takes a moment to stop, looks into my eyes. I can tell they are trying to take my measure, and I am grateful that they take their vote, their choice so seriously. And then they might say something like, I have a really terrible problem in my family. My son or my daughter has gotten addicted to opiates or to heroin. What are you going to do about it? Or maybe they will say, my brother has schizophrenia, and we can't afford to get him the kind of consistent care he needs . Or maybe they will say, I am a diabetic. And the drug company has just raised the cost of insulin, and I can't afford it. What are you going to do about it?\nThat is the right question to ask anybody running for president, because at the end of the day, this is about you. As I said the other night, we are going to invest in the middle class. We are going to grow this economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down.\nAnd we are going to make sure that we produce a enough good jobs with rising incomes so that every single person, especially every single young person in America can go as far as your hard work and talent will take you.\nNow, I've got to say, I believe in hard work. That is how I was raised. I believe you've got to work for what you get in life. But I think we have to knock down some of the barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead and going as far as they should. For me, that starts by believing in our country.\nYou know, there has been no other place in the history of the world that has given so much opportunity to so many. Do we have problems? We have problems. Do we have challenges? Of course we do. We are human beings. But boy, there is no more blessed place. And Donald Trump did something the other night that no other presidential nominee has ever done of either party. He refused to say he would respect the results of this election.\nMake no mistakes about this, my friends. He is threatening our democracy. Look, I have lost elections. You don't feel very good the next day, believe me. But we know in our country the difference between leadership and dictatorship, right?\nYou know, the peaceful transition of power is one of those things that sets us apart, and whether you support me or my opponent, together we must show we support American democracy. And I believe both Donald Trump and I should be grateful for the opportunities that our country has given us. And the best way to demonstrate that we support our democracy is to turn out and vote. And there is an inspiring story being written by people across America right now. We have just reached a milestone, more than 200 million Americans are registered to vote in this election.\nAnd you know what? That includes 50 -- more than 50 million young people. More than ever before. I find that a very hopeful sign. And here in Pennsylvania, hundreds of thousands of more voters are registered then were in 2012. What does this tell us? I think it tells us no matter how much negativity is out there, something exciting is happening right now. People are coming together -- democrats, republicans, independents -- all to reject hate and division.\nAnd in the states where they can, people are motivated to vote early, to defend core American values, and embrace a future where every person counts, everyone has a place, everyone can contribute. You see, despite what Donald Trump may think, most Americans really believe we can do better. Most Americans really believe women should be respected.\nMost Americans really believe that workers should be paid fairly. Most Americans be-lieve that the United States should work with our allies to lead the world and keep us safe.\nThe energy we are seeing in the final weeks of this campaign is about more than winning an election. It is about standing up to the kind of country that we want for ourselves and our children. And it is about the kind of lessons we want to teach our sons and daughters. I want you to know, if Tim and I are fortunate enough to be your president and vice president, we will work with everyone.\nNow I imagine here in allegheny county and if you are from further west, you probably know people who are thinking about voting for Donald Trump. And here is what I want you to tell them. I want you to tell them that I understand that they need a president who cares about them, will listen to them, and I want to be their president, too.\nBecause whether you agree or disagree with me, whether you vote for me or vote against me, I believe we can disagree without being disagreeable. I have seen that. I know it can happen. And I know there are a lot of people here in Pennsylvania who have a lot of questions. They want to know, how do we move forward better. They want to know about their town where there used to be a lot of jobs and there are not as many any more. They are upset what they see around them. I get that. But anger is not a plan.\nAnd we need -- we need to work together. We need plans that will help us deal with the legitimate concerns and questions that people have in Pennsylvania. I think that is what our whole country needs right now. That's what I will try to do. I am not going to pretend that we can snap our fingers and solve our problems. That does not happen in the real world. But I know we can make progress together. The choice we face in this election is stark, especially when it comes to the economy.\nTim and I believe when the middle class thrives, America thrives. And when we invest in working families, in the middle class, in small businesses, we can make the economy work again for everybody. I think it is fair to say that both Donald Trump and Pat Toomey have a different perspective. They believe -- and they believe this -- if you give trillions of dollars -- and they mean trillion with a t -- of tax cuts to millionaires, billionaires, corporations, it will all trickle down to everybody else. It has not worked before and it has caused us a lot of messes we have had to clean up, and I have been privileged to see presidents up close and personal -- right. Married to one, that's right. Worked for one.\nAnd here is what I know. That when you focus on helping the middle class, you end up lifting everybody. When you focus on helping the top, you help the top. That is not good enough. Donald likes to say he is on the side of American workers, but his actions tell a different story. Yes, he has bought cheap Chinese steel and aluminum for his construction projects. He should be buying good American-made steel that supports good American jobs.\nI would like to hear Donald explain to American steelworkers filing for unemployment why he put Chinese steel workers to work, instead of steelworkers here in Pennsylvania. And for all his talk about putting America first, he has made many of his products in 12 different countries. So if he wants to make America great again, why doesn't he start by making things in America? And we now know -- we now know he hasn't paid a dime in federal income taxes for years. He says that makes him smart. Well, I don't know how smart you have to be to lose a billion dollars in a year in the first place. Especially -- answer me this -- how do you lose a billion dollars when you are in the casino business?\nNever could figure that out. But what it means is that every one of us is paying more in federal income taxes than a billionaire has. That is wrong and we will end of those kinds of loopholes and gimmicks.\nI will tell you what. It also means Donald has contributed zero -- zero for our military, zero for our vets, zero for pell grants to help young people go to college, zero for our highways, zero for everything. And yet he stands up on stage and criticizes America. Well it's unfair and it's wrong. With your help, we will make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II, jobs in infrastructure. Our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our water systems all need help, and those are a lot of good jobs waiting to be done, jobs that can't be exported out of Pennsylvania.\nI believe we can bring advanced manufacturing back to the United States. That is why we will invest $10 billion in a make it in America partnerships that brings together workers and unions and businesses, universities, and community colleges.\nSome countries are going to take the lead with precision machineries. Some countries is going to take the lead with 3-d printing. We invented both of those technologies. We should take the lead and we should have the jobs.\nWe are also going to fight climate change with clean, renewable energy jobs. And we are going to help small businesses which will create two thirds of all of the new jobs in America. And we are going to defend your right to organize and bargain collectively for higher wages and benefits. Don't let anybody fool you, my friends. assault on worker rights and unions is an assault on the middle class.\nIt is time to say loudly and clearly, right to work is wrong for workers and wrong for America.\nSo, I have set some big goals. I am excited about what we are going to do. And it's all going to put people to work right here. And sometimes folks say to me, how are you going to get that done? You go to the congress —well first of all, I hope we will elect some or democrats. That will be job number one. Number two, I think it will be a very simple question. Our members of congress, members of the senate going to be on the side of the rich, the powerful, and the wealthy, or on your side? And you know what? They are going to have to answer that question. Because if they stay beholden to the special interest, if they continue to do the bidding of the lobbyist and lawyers and others who stand outside their doors -- I have been in the senate. I have seen it. I know it. If they are going to continue to do the work of those who are already privileged in America, then I want to make sure that they don't come back to Washington after the next election.\nWe are in a great, great high school here, and I am so proud to be here.\nAnd so, we are going to be a good partner with education, especially with educators. We are going to start with universal pre-k. We want good schools with good teachers in every zip code so every kid gets a world-class education.\nAnd I want us to bring technical education back to high school. I think it was a mistake when we took it out.\nThere are a lot of good jobs that you can be prepared for in today's economy -- coming out of high school, maybe going to community college, going into an apprenticeship program, and I want to lift up that work. A four-year college degree should not be and is not the only way to have a good job with the rising income and a satisfying life.\nWe are going to make public colleges and universities tuition free for any families making less than $125,000 a year. And we are going to help you pay down your college debt.\nIt's going to be great. To help you pay it back as a percentage of your income at your job, so you are never on the hook for more than you can afford. I worked on this with Senator Bernie Sanders, and it's going to help save -- it's going to help save people thousands of dollars.\nIn fact after a year, maybe after you are here -- you can go to hillaryclin-ton.com/calculator to see how much your family can save. We want you to know we are going to deliver results for you.\nI mean, ultimately it's pretty simple. I think the American dream is big enough for everybody and I want everybody to have your chance to get your piece of the American dream.\nSo, there's a lot of work we are going to be doing. We need to raise the national mini-mum wage. People who work full-time should not be mired in poverty. We are, as Tim said, going to guarantee equal pay for women. You know, look, it's not just a woman's issue. If you have a mother, which all of us do -- if you have a mother, a wife, a daughter, or a sister who's working, it's your issue. It's good for the entire family, it's good for our economy.\nSo my friends, there is a lot for us to do in the next 17 days. Because we have got to get the word out. We have got to tell everybody what we are doing and why this election is so critically important. And that's where all of you come in. If you do know people who are thinking about voting for our opponent.\nAudience Member: Nope!\nSecretary Clinton: Well, you may. You know, I hope you will stage an intervention.\nAnd I do hope you will talk about, you know, the reality versus the demagoguery of what we have seen in this campaign.\nYou know, we need to come together around all of the issues that are important to everybody and as I said in the beginning, whatever issue you care about, it's going to be on the ballot. I care a lot about making sure that women and girls are treated with dignity and respect that they deserve in our country.\nI care a lot about making sure that we save social security and we ensure that everybody has the benefits that they need in order to be able to live a decent life in retirement.\nAnd, boy, do I care a lot about our constitution.\nAnd maybe it's because on your behalf I went to 112 countries as your secretary of state. And I met a lot of people who in the us because we have been so steady and so committed to our constitutional system and our values. And what I hope is that you care as deeply as our founders did, as our parents and grandparents did, because maybe they came from somewhere else where they weren't treated right. Maybe they saw firsthand what it meant to be deprived of the rule of law.\nYou know, every time Donald Trump says he wants to jail his opponent, meaning me, I think to myself, you know, we don't do that in America. We actually have laws and courts and an independent judiciary.\nOr, you know, when he blows up at a journalist or criticizes the press and goes on and on and on.\nYou know, I get criticized by the press. I know that is part of our democratic system. We believe in a free press. And boy, if you go to countries where there isn't one, you will understand why that is so important.\nAnd when he says there should be a religious test -- a religious test for people at our borders, a country founded on religious freedom. You have to ask yourself, who is going to conduct the test? Are we going to get a quiz? What if the border security official does not believe you? Who gets to decide whether you get to come in or out based on your religion?\nAnd if you haven't seen it yet, I hope you will go and look at the extraordinary statement by Mr. Khan on Youtube in a new video that we have put out. You remember, he pulled out a constitution at our convention. And he reveres our constitution. And for good reason. Because he, too, came from a place where the was no rule of law to speak of.\nSo, whatever issue you care about, this is an issue that will be decided by this election, and that is why I'm reaching out to republicans, democrats, independents, everyone. I know if we bring our talent, our energy, and our ambition to the work of building our country, we are going to see the best days of America ahead of us, and when your chil-dren and your grandchildren ask what you did in 2016 when everything was on the line, I hope you will say you voted for a better America.\nSo, here we go. Just remember -- you've got to get out and vote, you've got to get everybody you know to get out and vote. If you do not know where to vote, please go to iwillvote.com. You can put your information in and, it is the magic of the internet. They will tell you where you are supposed to vote. You can go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer. Or you can take your phone out right and text join to 47246. And if we can get all of you and everybody you know involved in this next 17 days, I will tell you this -- it is easy to forget how far our country has come.\nThere are a lot of people here -- as I said, whose parents and grandparents came here as immigrants. My grandfather, Hugh Rodam, came as an immigrant, as a young boy and settled in Scranton. And he went to work in the Scranton lace mills, he went to work in his teens, he worked there until he retired at the age of 65. He believed in our country. He believed in the kind of future he could get through his hard work. That is what I want everybody in our country to believe again. We are going to unleash the talent, the innovation, the energy that brought people like my grandfather here, but which we will harness for the future. Don't let anybody tell you America's best days are behind us. Don't believe that for a minute.\nWe are going to pull together. We are going to make it clear that confidence and opti-mism, respect for each other, bringing folks together who may disagree but can begin to find common ground is what has always worked and it will work again. Help us. Help us create that kind of future, and help us prove once and for all that love trumps hate.\nThank you all.\"", "timestamp": "2016-10-22", "title": "Remarks at Taylor Allderdice High School in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}

[applause]\nThank you very much thank you ladies and gentlemen. Thank you please sit down. Thank you.\nIt's my privilege to be here in Gettysburg hallowed ground where so many lives were given in service to freedom. Amazing place.\nPresident Lincoln served at a time of division like we've never seen before. It is my hope that we can look at his example to heal the divisions we are living through right now. We are a very divided nation.\nI'm not a politician and have never wanted to be a politician, believe me. But, when I saw the trouble our country was in I knew I couldn't stand by and watch any longer.\nOur country has been so good to me. I love our country and I felt I had to act. [applause]\nI've seen the system up-close-and-personal for many years. I've been a major part of it.\nI know how the game works in Washington and on Wall Street and I know how they've rigged the rules of the game against everyday Americans. The rules are rigged.\nNearly one in four Americans in their prime earning years isn't even working. One in five households have no one with a job. 45 million Americans are on food stamps and 47 million are living in poverty.\nWe have failed our inner cities and in so doing have failed our African-American and Hispanic communities.\nWe've misguided military adventures overseas and wars that go on forever that just cannot be won by the people that are doing it now. They don't know how to win the wars at home.\nWe have our great veterans dying while waiting for medical care.\nChange has to come from outside our very broken system. Our system is broken.\nThe fact that Washington and the Washington establishment has tried so hard to stop our campaign is only more proof that our campaign represents the kind of change that only arrives once-in-a-lifetime. [applause]\nThe system is totally rigged and broken. First, the issue of voter fraud. According to Pew, there are 24 million voter registrations in the United States that are either invalid or significantly significantly inaccurate. And when I say that there are such inaccuracies, it's unbelievable.\n1.8 million dead people are registered to vote and some of them are voting. I wonder how that happens.\n2.8 million people are registered in more than one state is a number folks. These are numbers.\nFourteen percent of non-citizens are registered to vote. The system is also rigged because Hillary Clinton should have been precluded from running for the presidency of the United States. But, the FBI and the Justice Department covered up her crimes which included lying to the FBI and congress on numerous occasions and included saying I do not recall to the FBI on 39 separate times.\nShe recalls everything else, but 39 separate times she said I do not recall. Well, that's a lies. Also, then there is the deletion of at least 33,000 emails after receiving a subpoena from the United States Congress that's after receiving the subpoena as an example.\nIt was announced this week that the highly-respected four-star general James Cartwright, maybe sentenced to up to five years in prison with a massive fine for lying on one occasion to the FBI. He said he did that for national security reasons.\nHighly respected man. A four-star general. This took place two days ago. How must he feel. A big part of the rigging of this election is the fact that Hillary is being allowed to run despite having broken so many laws on so many different occasions.\nWhy is she allowed to run? The dishonest, mainstream media is also part in a major part of this corruption. They're corrupt. They lie and fabricate stories to make a candidate that is not their preferred choice, look as bad and even dangerous as possible.\nAt my rallies, they never show or talk about the massive crowd size and try to diminish all of our events.\nOn the other hand, they don't show the small size of Hillary's crowds but in fact talk about how many people are there. Very small crowds. You know it. They know it.\nOver the last two days, three highly respected national polls said we're in first place and one of those pollsters was the most accurate pole on the last two cycles. But, the media refuses to even say it or put that word out. They refused to talk about it.\nThey're trying desperately to suppress my vote and the voice of the American people as an example of the power structure and fighting. AT&T is buying Time Warner and the CNN. A deal we will not approve in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\nLikewise, Amazon, which through its ownership controls the Washington Post, should be paying massive taxes. It's not paying and it's a very unfair playing field and you see what that's happening and what that's doing to department stores all over the country.\nVery very unfair and you're talking about billions and billions of dollars. They should be paying those taxes.\nAdditionally, Comcast purchase of NBC concentrates far too much power in one massive entity that is trying to tell the voters what to think and what to do. Deals like this destroy democracy and we'll look at breaking that deal up and other deals like that.\nThis should never ever have been approved in the first place. They're trying to poison the mind of the American voter. Every woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign. Total Fabrication. The events never happened, never. All of these liars will be sued after the election is over but a simple phone called placed to the biggest newspapers or television networks get them wall-to-wall coverage with virtually no fact-checking whatsoever.\nHere is why this is relevant to you. If they can fight somebody like me who has unlimited resources to fight back, just look at what they can do to you. Your jobs. Your security. Your education. Your healthcare. The violation of religious liberty. The theft of your second amendment. The loss of your factories, your homes, and much more.\nLook at what they've done to you with your jobs. It is just been lined on video, that the violent protests at some of my rallies, like in Chicago, where police and others were seriously hurt. You saw that blood pouring down their face were caused by paid, paid DNC and Clinton campaign operatives.\nNow, we didn't know this. We didn't know, this just came out two days ago on tape. We didn't know this. We were amazed at the level of violence. These were paid operatives. Paid by the DNC and probably the Clinton campaign.\nThis is a criminal act. Policemen were badly hurt and so were many others and these people prosecuted. But because of the rigged system they probably won't be. Just like we found out about these paid violent protesters, it was probably the DNC and the Clinton campaign that put forward these liars with their fabricated stories. But, we'll find out their involvement at a later date through litigation and I look so forward to doing.\nThe rigging of the system is designed for one reason, to keep the corrupt establishment and special interests in power at your expense and everybody's expense.\nI have no special interest but you the American Vogel. [applause]\nI didn't have to do this, believe me. There's nothing easy about it but I had to do it.\nI love our country.\nI love the people of our country and I felt I had to do it. [applause]\nThank you. One thing we all know is that we will never solve our problems by relying on the same politicians who created these problems in the first place.\nHillary Clinton is not running against me, she's running against change and she's running against all of the American people and all of the American voters. [applause]\nWe now find ourselves at that very special fork in the road, do we repeat the mistakes of the past or do we choose to believe that a great future yet unwritten still lies ahead for us and for our wonderful beloved country. [applause]\nI think it does.\nI know it does.\nMy economic plan will deliver at least 25 million jobs in one decade. Now, our jobs have been taken away. They've gone to Mexico. They've gone to so many other countries. It's a one lane highway where they get the jobs, they get the factories, they get the money, and we get the drugs and we get the unemployment and it's going to change.\nBelieve me it's going to change. [applause]\nAnd that goes for all countries. When you look at China, when you look at every trade deal we have, is horrible and we should be ashamed of a people and the people that let those deals happen.\nThey're defective and they knew they were defective and they were done for a reason. And believe me they will be unwound so fast and we will have trade. We will have great trade and it'll be free trade but it'll be fair trade and it'll be real.\nMy security plan, so important.\nThey've taken the jobs from us.\nMy security plan will bring safety to our poorest communities.\nMy ethics plan will end corruption in our government. [applause] We will. Corruption is massive.\nWe will drain the swamp in Washington DC and replace it with a new government of, by, and for the people. [applause]\nThat is why I have chosen Gettysburg to unveil this contract. I'm asking the American people to rise above the noise and the clutter of our broken politics and to embrace that great faith and optimism that has always been the central ingredient in the American character and there's nothing better or stronger than the American character. [applause]\nI am asking the American people to dream big once again.\nWhat follows is my 100-day action plan to Make America Great Again. It's a contract between Donald J Trump and the American voter – and begins with bringing honesty, accountability and change to Washington DC.\nTherefore, on the first day of my term of office, my administration will immediately pursue the following six measures to clean up the corruption and special interest collusion in Washington, DC:\nFIRST, a Constitutional Amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress. [applause]\nSECOND, a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce federal workforce through attrition exempting military, public safety, and public health. [applause]\nTHIRD, a requirement that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated. Regulations are killing our country and our jobs. [applause]\nFOURTH, a 5 year-ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service, making a fortune. [applause]\nFIFTH, a lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government, very bad.[applause]\nSIXTH, a complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections, that's what's happening. [applause]\nOn the same day, I will begin taking and really taking strongly 7 actions to protect American workers. Our American workers have been treated so badly by politicians that don't have their interest at heart and we are going to change that. We're going to change that very very fast.\nFIRST, I will announce my intention to totally renegotiate NAFTA one of the worst deals our country has ever made signed by Bill Clinton or withdraw from the deal under Article 2205. [applause]\nSECOND, I will announce our withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership a potential disaster for our country. [applause]\nTHIRD, I will direct my Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator. China is a currency manipulator. What they have done to us by playing currency is very sad and I don't blame them. They have been very smart. I blame our politicians for letting this take place. So easy to stop so easy to stand.\nFOURTH, I will direct the Secretary of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative to identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly impact American workers and direct them to use every tool under American and international law to end those abuses immediately. [applause]\nFIFTH, very importantly I will lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion dollars' worth of job producing American energy reserves, [applause] including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal and we will put our miners back to work.\nSIXTH, I will lift the Obama-Clinton roadblocks that allow for this vital energy infrastructure projects to forward. We have roadblocks like you've never ever seen. Environmental blocks, structural blocks, we're going to allow the Keystone Pipeline and so many other things to move forward. Tremendous numbers of jobs and good for our country.\nSEVENTH, we are going to cancel billions in payments to U.N. climate change programs [applause] and use the money to fix America's water and environmental infrastructure. We're paying billions and billions and billions of dollars. We're going to fix our own environment. [applause].\nAdditionally, on the first day, I will take the following five actions to restore security and the constitutional rule of law. We have to do that.\nFIRST, cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama.\nSECOND, begin the process of selecting a replacement for Justice Scalia whose wife by the way has a Trump sign. His wife is a phenomenal woman. Has a Trump sign in her front yard, isn't that nice? I just found that out this morning. From one of the 20 judges on my list, you know we're going to make great decisions from twenty outstanding judges on a list that we submitted who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. [applause]\nTHIRD, we will cancel all federal funding to Sanctuary Cities. [applause]\nFOURTH, we will begin removing the more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants from the country these are drug dealers, gang heads, gang members, killers, and cancel visas to foreign countries that won't take them back [applause] and when Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State and they had someone who was bad, really bad and they brought him back to the country and the country wouldn't take him. She said we'll bring him back; we don't want to force the country to take him. There won't be one such instance if I become president. [applause]\nFIFTH, We're going to suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur. [applause] And if you look at Syria and the migration, we're taking in thousands and thousands of people into our country. We have no idea who they are, what their thought process is, where they come from and Hillary Clinton wants to increase the number of those thousands and thousands currently pouring by 550%. Radical, Islamic terror is right around the corner. We have to be so tough, so smart, so vigilant. We can't allow that to happen [applause] we have enough problems. [applause] All vetting of people coming into our country will be considered extreme vetting. We will be very careful.\nNext, I will work with Congress to introduce the following broader legislative measures and fight for their passage within the first 100 days of my Administration:\n1. Middle Class Tax Relief and Simplification Act. An economic plan designed to grow the economy 4% per year and create at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax reduction and simplification, in combination with trade reform, regulatory relief, and lifting the restrictions on American energy. [applause] We need that so badly. We need jobs. Our jobs have left us. Our good jobs have really left us.\nThe largest tax reductions are for the middle class. [applause] Who have been forgotten. Called the forgotten man and woman. They have been forgotten. A middle-class family with 2 children will get basically a 35% tax cut. And that's what they can use and that money will go back into the economy. The current number of brackets will be reduced from 7 to 3, and tax forms will likewise be greatly simplified. [applause]\nThe business rate will be lowered from 35 to 15 percent, and the trillions of dollars of American corporate money overseas can now be brought back at a 10 percent rate. It's stuck. We can't bring it back. Two and a half to five trillion dollars. Companies can't get it back into the country. Some companies are actually leaving not only because taxes are so high but because the can't get their money and they are actually leaving to get their money. We are going to simplify that. We're going to have them bring the money back into our country and use the money and spend the money on building our country. [applause]\n2. The Offshoring Act Establishes tariffs to discourage companies from laying off their workers in order to relocate in other countries and ship their products back to the U.S. tax-free. [applause]\nThey leave the United Stated like carrier like forward like so many others. They leave the United States and fire all of their employees. They go to Mexico or another country. They build a beautiful brand new plant. They hire other people. They then take their air conditioners, their cars, whatever they're making. They send it tax free across what will be a very strong border believe me [applause] but they send it tax free across the border and what do we end with we have?\nWe have unemployment, tremendous losses, and we have none of the benefits. So we will establish tariffs that when they do that there will be consequences. We will work with them; we will be nice we will be fair but there has to be consequences. And when they know their consequences our companies will stop leaving the United States and going to other countries.\n3. American Energy & Infrastructure Act. Leverages public-private partnerships, and private investments through tax incentives, to spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment over 10 years. Our infrastructure is in such trouble. We've doubled our national debt to 20 trillion dollars under president Obama. In less than 8 years, 10 trillion dollars has been added. Think of it and we haven't fixed anything. We haven't fixed anything. What have we doe? Our roads are broken, our bridges, our tunnels, our hospitals, our schools, and we have 20 trillion in debt. All-time high. That's true, our VA hospitals are in bad shape. VA is in very very bad shape and we will fix that. We are going to work on fixing that [applause] because our veterans are not treated properly. We have illegal immigrants that are treated far better in many instances than our veterans [applause] and we're not going to have that. It is revenue neutral.\n4. School Choice and Education Opportunity Act. Redirects education dollars to gives parents the right to send their kid to the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice. [applause] And so importantly ends common core, brings education supervision to local communities.\nWe do so badly on education. If you look at the lists, you see Sweden, Norway, Denmark, different countries at the top. You see us at the bottom and yet by far, per-pupil, more money than anybody and it's not even close. We spend more money per-pupil than anybody not even close. We're at the bottom of the list. Other countries spending far less per-pupil are at the top of the list so obviously our current system is not working. We will change it and we will make it good. [applause] It expands vocational and technical education, which we've totally forgotten about in this country and make 2 and 4-year college more affordable.\nHave you ever gone to school and you've been with people that aren't good students but they can fix an engine or they can build a wall or they can do things that you wouldn't even think about because we can use some of the one who build the wall [laughter] we're going to need them [laughter] we're going to need them but did you ever see that how they are genius at fixing a car? They can do anything, but history, not so good, physics, not so good, we have to open vocational again. [applause]\nThose are people those are great people.\n5. Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act. [applause] Fully repeal Obamacare and replace it with Health Savings Accounts, so we can do that. The Health Savings Account, it's one way there are numerous ways but this one very good way. The ability to purchase health insurance across state lines. We have to do it because that's competition. The politicians won't let go of it because the insurance companies, they don't want competition but we'll open it up. Believe me we will get rid of it I've been saying it for years. And lets states manage Medicaid funds it will be so good. Reforms will also include cutting the red tape at the FDA: there are over 4,000 drugs awaiting approval, and we especially want to speed the approval of life-saving medications. Mean they are looking at drugs that are looking very good and you have terminal patients that it's over, these people are dying, they want to get the drug. They won't be living much longer and we study it for years and years and at some point they have to do what they have to do. They have to do it properly but we have 4,000 different drugs and products waiting in ling for approval and we can't get them approved. We are going to speed up that process very significantly\n6. Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act. Allows Americans to deduct childcare and elder care from their taxes, incentivizes employers to provide on-site childcare services, and you see that with a couple of companies and it is such a great thing to see and creates tax-free Dependent Care Savings Accounts for both young and elderly dependents, with matching contributions for low-income families. [applause] so good\n7. End Illegal Immigration Act. [applause]\nFully-funds the construction of a wall on our southern border, don't worry about it. Remember I said Mexico's paying for the wall. With the full understanding that the country Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such wall. Ok. We are going to have the wall; Mexico is going to pay for the wall. Mexico's by the way I met with the President of Mexico 2 Ѕ months ago, wonderful meeting, wonderful person. But I told him this is a two-way highway not a one-way highway.\nWe have our people. We have out take care of our people. Have to protect our people so it's got to be a two-way street otherwise it is going to be a whole different deal. But establishes a 2-year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence, there are people coming in illegally, for illegally re-entering the U.S. after a previous deportation, and a 5-year mandatory minimum for illegally re-entering for those with felony convictions, multiple misdemeanor convictions or two or more prior deportations; so when somebody comes in, we send them out. They come back, they go to prison for quite a while. They come back, they come back again they go five years. Because what is happening is they are coming back ten times and I could go cases after case they come back.Look at what happened in San Francisco five times he came back on the fifth time he killed. Five times. But so many others 110 times came back, killed somebody after ten times. When they get deported they stay out otherwise they have very serious prison terms. They will stay out. Once you do that, they will stay out. Right now, they have no consequence. They have no consequence.\nAlso reforms on visa rules to enhance penalties for overstaying and to ensure open jobs are offered to American workers first. [applause]\n8. Restoring Community Safety Act. Reduces surging crime, drugs and violence by creating a Task Force On Violent Crime and increasing funding for programs that train and assist local police who are doing such a great job, believe me. We increase the resources for federal law enforcement agencies and federal prosecutors to dismantle criminal gangs and put violent offenders behind bars [applause] or out of our country and into the country where they came from. [applause]\n9. Restoring National Security Act. Which rebuilds our military by eliminating the defense sequester which has been very tough on military and expanding military investment.\nNow, at no time, practically, do we need a military like right now. We don't want to use it, but it is peace through strength. We need a strong military. [applause]\nOur military is so terribly depleted. It also provides Veterans with the ability to receive public VA treatment or attend the private doctor of their choice. If they're waiting on line and I have the plan up and we've gotten as you know tremendous support from veterans, from law enforcement, from veterans, from the military tremendous support. But if they're waiting in line and you see it 22 suicides a day, people don't even believe it, but 22 suicides a day. But if they're waiting in line 47 days, 6 days, 9 days, they can't get to see a doctor and a simple procedure or a simple prescription can solve their problem and they become very sick and they die, they die waiting in line. We're going to give them the power to go across the street to a local doctor, a private doctor, a public hospital, or private hospital, all looking to help and all looking to do business. And we will pay the bill. So much cheaper but much more importantly the veterans will finally be taken care of properly because what they are going through now is unacceptable. [applause]\nAlso, we are going to protect our vital infrastructure from the new thing, cyber-attack; establishes new screening procedures for immigration to ensure those who are admitted to our country support our people and our values [applause] we want people that love our country or can love our country and people that will love our citizens. [applause]\nWe want people that can love us and there are ways through talent of determining that and other countries do but we don't. Just come on in folks. Just come on in.\n10. Clean up Corruption in Washington Act. Enacts tough new ethics reforms to reduce the corrupting influence of special interests and donors on our politics.\nOn November 8th, Americans will be voting for this 100-day plan to restore prosperity to our economy, security to our communities, and honesty to our government. This is my pledge to you. And if we follow these steps, we will once more have a government of, by and for the people. [applause]\nAnd importantly we will Make America Great Again.\nBelieve me.", "timestamp": "2016-10-22", "title": "Remarks on Proposals for the First 100 Days in Office at the Eisenhower Complex in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "The address was recorded at approximately 2:05 p.m. on October 21 in the Roosevelt Room at the White House for broadcast on October 22. The transcript was made available by the Office of the Press Secretary on October 21, but was embargoed for release until 6 a.m. on October 22. The Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish language transcript of this address.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119533", "text": "Hi, everybody. I'm going to be honest with you: One of the best parts of being President is having your own really nice plane. And I'm going to miss it a lot, because up until I ran for this office, I was mostly flying coach. So I know what a pain the whole process can be, from searching for the best prices to that feeling you get when the baggage carousel stops and yours still hasn't come out.\nNow, our airlines employ a lot of hard-working folks—from pilots and flight attendants to ticket agents and baggage handlers—all who take pride in getting us to our destinations safely, and on time. They do good work, and we're proud of them. But I think we all know that the system can work a little better for everybody.\nThat's why, over the last 8 years, my administration has taken some commonsense steps to do just that. We've put in place rules that virtually eliminated excessive delays on the tarmac. We've required airlines to grant travelers more flexibility on cancellations, to provide refunds to anyone who cancels within 24 hours of purchase, and to give you better compensation if you got bumped off your flight because it was oversold.\nAnd this week, I was proud to build on that progress with even more actions to save you money, create more competition in the marketplace, and make sure that you're getting what you pay for. First, we're proposing refunds for anyone whose bag is delayed, because you should not have to pay extra for a service you don't even receive. Second, we're requiring airlines to report more information on things like how likely it is that you'll lose your luggage or reach your destination on time. Third, we're providing more protections for travelers with disabilities. And finally, we're ramping up transparency requirements for online ticket platforms so sites can't privilege one airline over another without you knowing about it.\nAll of this should help you make better decisions for yourselves and your families and, hopefully, avoid a few headaches too. It's another example of how Government can be a force of good: standing up for consumers, ensuring businesses compete fairly to give you the best services at the best prices, and making sure everyday Americans have a voice in the conversation, not just corporate shareholders. That's what this is all about: taking steps, some big and some small, that can make your life a little bit better.\nThanks, everybody. Have a great weekend.", "timestamp": "2016-10-22", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}
{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "note": "As prepared for delivery.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119187", "text": "Thank you.\nIt's great to be back here in beautiful Naples.\nIn 16 days, we are going to win the great state of Florida and we are going to win the White House.\nEarly voting begins tomorrow, and you can already get your absentee ballot, so make sure to start voting.\nYesterday, I outlined my Contract with the American Voter – a detailed list of solutions to bring prosperity to our economy, safety to our communities, and honesty to our government.\nOne of the issues I addressed at length is the issue of government corruption. I put forward a plan to stop it; my opponent has no plan to end government corruption because she is the embodiment of government corruption. Even as she was preparing to run for President, WikiLeaks emails show, Hillary was trying to get $12 million from the King of Morocco in yet one more Pay-For-Play scheme.\nMy goal is to keep foreign money out of American politics. Hillary Clinton's goal is to put the Oval Office up for sale to whatever country offers the highest price.\nSo I have a message today to the voters of America. It's a message for Republicans, Democrats and Independents. It's a message for those living in rural America, urban America and suburban America – because we are all just One America.\nIt's a message for everyone who wants to take back our government from the special interests.\nAnd my message is this: if we win on November 8th, we are going to fix our rigged system and we are going to Drain The Swamp Of Corruption In Washington, D.C.\nThat change includes a new foreign policy that puts America First.\nHillary Clinton's foreign policy has squandered trillions in American wealth overseas. Yet, for all the money spent, all Clinton delivered was death, destruction and terrorism. She unleashed ISIS and turmoil in Iraq, Syria and Libya.\nNext, trigger-happy Hillary wants to start a shooting war in Syria that could involve nuclear-armed Russia – she has bad judgment, bad instincts, and is just too reckless to be allowed into the Oval Office.\nHillary also started the negotiations that led to the Iran deal – and thus ultimately leading to the $1.7 billion ransom for American hostages.\nClinton gave Iran everything they wanted and more – including Iraq. Now, Iran is emboldened as never before.\nIn the latest insult to America, the government of Iran is demanding \"many billions,\" in new ransom payments for an American businessman and his ailing father. Adding to the insult, Iran has released a video of their captive that includes footage from earlier this year of American soldiers being forced to their knees at gunpoint.\nThe humiliation for our country never seems to end – and it's the humiliation brought on by a Secretary of State who was more interested in getting paid by foreign countries, than in representing the country she lives in.\nTo cover-up her crimes as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton bleached and deleted 33,000 emails, lied to Congress under oath, made 13 phones disappear – some with a hammer – and then told the FBI she couldn't remember 39 times.\nThe best evidence that the system is rigged is that Hillary Clinton is even allowed to run for President in the first place.\nThe Clintons grew their gross income by $60 million while Hillary was Secretary of State. She's not a diplomat – she's a grifter, always looking for an easy way to sell government favors and access in exchange for cash.\nThe Clintons end up with the money, and America ends up with the humiliation.\nWhen I am President, America will be respected in the world once again.\nThat also means standing up against the oppression of the Castro regime in Cuba, and standing in solidarity with freedom-loving people in Venezuela and across Latin America living under oppression. The Obama-Clinton Administration has abandoned our friends in Latin America, and delivered only poverty and joblessness for Hispanic-Americans here at home.\nIf you elect me, along with a Republican House and Senate, we will also immediately repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military. It's part of my 100-day plan.\nThis will be a national effort that will involve everywhere from Key West to Tampa to the Space Coast to Jacksonville to the Panhandle.\nMy proposal is based on three crucial words: Peace Through Strength.\nThis defense build-up will be supported by ships in Mayport, and by engineers and advanced manufacturing on the Space Coast. New aircraft will fly from MacDill Air Force Base and Naval Air Station Pensacola.\nNew Navy and Coast Guard ships will patrol the Florida coast to prevent drugs and terrorists from entering our shores.\nWith a Republican House and Senate, we will also immediately repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. Even Bill Clinton admitted Obamacare is \"the craziest thing in the world,\" where \"people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half.\"\nReplacing Obamacare is part of my 100-day contract with the American Voter.\nA Republican House and Senate can swiftly enact the other items in my contract immediately, including massive tax reduction and tax simplification for the middle class. My plan to transform our tax, regulatory, energy and trade policies is the most pro-growth plan in American history. It includes lowering our business tax from 35 to 15 percent. My reform plan will lift millions out of poverty, raise wages dramatically, and create at least 25 million new jobs in 10 years – and we can enact the whole plan in our first 100 days.\nA Trump Administration will also work alongside you to restore and protect the beautiful Florida Everglades. Our plan will also help you upgrade water and wastewater systems so that the Florida Aquifer is pure and safe from pollution.\nWe will also repair the Herbert Hoover Dike in Lake Okeechobee.\nMy contract includes something else at the very center of this campaign: fixing our trade deals and ending the offshoring of American jobs.\nOne more way our system is rigged against the American Worker is that companies, like Carrier, simply fire their workers and move their operations to Mexico and other countries.\nWhen I'm President, if companies want to fire their workers and leave for other countries, then we will charge them a 35% tax when they want to ship their products back into the United States.\nWe have a nearly $800 billion-dollar annual trade deficit in goods with the world. 1 in 5 American households don't have a single person in that household with a job.\nFlorida has lost 1 in 4 of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton.\nWe've lost 70,000 factories since China's entry into the World Trade Organization – another Bill and Hillary-backed deal.\nWe are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.\nA Trump Administration will stop the jobs from leaving our country.\nWe will start making things in America.\nWe will be a rich nation once again.\nBut to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.\nImmigration security is national security.\nHillary's pledge for \"open borders\" includes an open border with the Middle East – meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within your communities and near your families.\nA new WikiLeaks email shows John Podesta secretly worried about the fact that Hillary Clinton never put procedures in place to keep the San Bernardino shooter out of America – including a plan to review social media postings. We're letting in Radical Islamic Terrorists right through the front door, and stamping their visas \"approved\" on the way in.\nSo let me state this as clearly as I can.\nIf I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.\nWe will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration.\nA Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes, we will build a wall.\nWe have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers.\nAll across our nation, innocent Americans have been killed by illegal immigrant criminals who should never have been in our country.\nKate Steinle was gunned down in her father's arms in broad daylight on a San Francisco pier. Her killer had been deported 5 times before.\n90 year-old Earl Olander was brutally beaten to death in his home by illegal immigrants with criminal records and left on the floor of his home to die.\nLaura Wilkerson's teenage son, Josh, was tortured and beaten to do by an illegal immigrant he offered to give a ride home. His body was viciously burned.\nThe examples go on and on and on.\nUnder a Trump Administration, this crime wave will come crashing to an end.\nThat includes the proposal, in my contract, for tough mandatory minimum prison sentences for illegal immigrants who re-enter the country after a previous deportation.\nWith a victory in November, everything will change.\nHere are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:\nthe biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every disadvantaged child in America, and we are going to end Common Core; support the men and women of law enforcement; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\nYou have 16 days to make this all happen – but you have to get out and vote, and that includes helping me elect a Republican Congress to enact my 100-day America-First action plan.\nOur failed establishment will be replaced with a new government guided by the principles I outlined in my contract with the American Voter.\nIt will be a government of, by and for the people.\nFor those who feel like they don't have a voice, I have a simple reply: I Am Your Voice.\nI'm going to fight for every American in every last part of this nation.\nI'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people – not the donors and special interests.\nAnd I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.\nImagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.\nYou're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life.\nThis is a movement like the world has never seen before.\nYou're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most\nimportant vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time.\nWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.", "timestamp": "2016-10-23", "title": "Remarks at the Collier County Fairgrounds in Naples, Florida"}

Hello, Cheyenne High School! Oh, it is good to be back in Nevada! I heard the other guy was trying to tell you how to say Nevada. You remember that?\nAudience members. Yes!\nAudience member. Four more years!\nThe President. Can't do it. [Laughter] I am so glad to be back here; I've got so many good friends. I am so blessed to be here. I'm glad to be back at this outstanding high school. Thank you for hosting us. I've got some really, really good friends here, folks who supported me when nobody could pronounce my name. [Laughter] But some of my friends everybody here knows because they've been friends to everybody in Nevada. And so I want to just make sure to give them a shout-out. First——\nAudience member. I love you!\nThe President. I love you back.\nBut first and foremost, somebody who has been not just an outstanding elected official, but he has been my friend. I could not have gotten done any of the things I got done had it not been for him getting my back every step of the way. I love this guy. He has always stood up for Nevada first. He's stood up for working people. He's never forgotten where he came from. Give it up for your Senator, Harry Reid. I love Harry Reid. Love—I love his wife Landra more, because she's even more loveable. [Laughter]\nI also want to make sure that you are turning out to make sure that we get a couple of outstanding members back in the House of Representatives. Jacky Rosen and Ruben Kihuen. And along with electing those two outstanding officials to Congress, we've got to make sure that your next United States Senator is Catherine Cortez Masto!\nAudience member. I love you Obama!\nThe President. I love you back. I love you guys so much. I do.\nSo I was driving over here and going through—we didn't drive right through the Strip, but we drove passed the Strip—and it made me think that Vegas is a place where people are always looking to improve their odds. I notice, my staff never complains about a trip to Vegas. [Laughter] But I'm here right now to tell you that you've got a sure thing. You've got the winning hand. You've got Blackjack. And the way to do it, the way to make sure that you win this hand, the way you boost Catherine's odds of winning this election, the way you make sure that Jacky and Ruben are in Congress is to go vote! You've got to go vote! [Applause] You've got to vote!\nHere in Nevada, you don't have to wait until November 8. Early voting started yesterday. Yes. you've got a ace, and you've got a jack. But you've got to make sure to turn over the card by voting! This game didn't start on November 8, the game ends on November 8. It's starting right now. So if you need to find out where you can vote early, just go to iwillvote.com. I want everybody to say that: iwillvote.com.\nAudience members. Iwillvote.com!\nThe President. Iwillvote.com.\nAudience members. Iwillvote.com.\nThe President. Iwillvote.com.\nAudience members. Iwillvote.com!\nThe President. All right. See this nice, big sign: Vote early! And I need you also, because not everybody is as fired up, not everybody is as focused as you are, I need everybody to pull out your phones, if you've got it, right now. I know you guys have got phones: Pull out. [Laughter] If you've got your phone with you, pull it out. Don't just save it for the selfie. [Laughter] And text \"volunteer\" to 47246—47246—that way you can sign up for a volunteer shift in the last 4 days. Because we're going to need to make sure everybody votes. I need you to make phone calls. I need you to knock on doors. I need you to call up cousin Pookie and say, Pookie, it's time to vote. I need you to go—[laughter]—I need you to go call Jesse, say, Jesse, come on. Don't be sitting on the couch. It's time to vote. Everybody's got to vote early. That's how we won in '08. That's how we won in 2012. That's how we're going to win in 2016.\nBecause, let's face it, Nevada is always close. Nevada always makes you a little nervous because you kind of don't know what's going to happen. [Laughter] But that's what makes it exciting. I was here in Nevada in the closing days of both my campaigns; both times, you guys came through. I turned over that card, and it was an ace. And Michelle and I thank you from the bottom of our hearts for all the support and all the prayers these past 8 years. It has been such a privilege to serve you.\nAudience member. We love you!\nThe President. But being back here in the closing days of another hard-fought campaign makes me think about how far we've come together. Back in '08, we had gone through two long wars. We were about to enter into the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes. Nevada was ground zero. You remember the housing market just collapsed. Folks were losing jobs, losing homes. On issues like health care, issues like climate change, we weren't doing anything about it, just kicking the can down the road.\nAnd I remember—you remember I told you now, I said, look, I'm—talk to Michelle, I'm not a perfect man. [Laughter] I won't be a perfect President. But I told you I would work as hard as I could, every single day, to make sure that you had a better shot at living out your dreams.\nAnd 8 years later, 8 years later, we've fought our way back from recession. We have created 15 million new jobs. We've slashed our dependence on foreign oil. We've doubled our production of clean energy, including right here in Nevada. Got solar panels all over the place, in part, thanks to the work that Harry did. Incomes went up last year more than any time since they've been keeping records. Poverty fell faster than any time since 1968. The uninsured rate is now at an alltime low. We brought our brave troops home to their families. We knocked out Usama bin Laden. Marriage equality is a reality in all 50 States.\nHigh school graduation rates, never been higher; college enrollment at an alltime high—by so many measures, our country is stronger, it is more prosperous, it is safer than it was 8 years ago. But for all the progress we've made, if we don't work as hard as we can in these next 16 days, all that progress could be out the window. Because competing for the job I currently hold, you've got a guy who proves himself unfit for this office every single day, every single way. And on the other side, you've got somebody who is as qualified as has ever run for the Presidency: Hillary Rodham Clinton.\nAnd here's the thing: Presidents can't do everything on their own. If I didn't have Harry, then I couldn't have gotten one what I got done. If we didn't have Nancy Pelosi, we would not have passed so many of the laws that have benefited millions of Americans. So we can't elect Hillary and then saddle her with a Congress that is do-nothing, won't even try to do something, won't even get their own stuff passed, much less the stuff you want passed. Who—all they've got to offer is blocking and obstructing every step of the way. We've got to have a Congress that's willing to make progress on the issues Americans care about.\nHere in Nevada, you've—you're trying to replace one of the toughest fighters I've ever known in Harry Reid. So you can choose somebody with a proven track record for standing up for Nevada families: Catherine Cortez Masto. Because Catherine's story is Nevada's story. Think about it. Her grandfather comes here from Mexico, enlists in the U.S. Army, settles here in Nevada, works hard as a baker. Her dad started out parking cars at the Dunes Hotel, went on to live a life of public service. He made it possible for Catherine and her sister to get a great education.\nAnd, Nevada, that's the kind of person you want representing you: somebody who's not going to forget where she came from. Somebody who knows what it's like to work hard. Somebody who knows what it's like for an immigrant to come here and live out the American Dream. You can make her the first-ever Latina to serve in the United States Senate ever. [Applause] Ever. And here's somebody who spent a career in Nevada working with Democrats and Republicans and law enforcement to do right by you and make you safer.\nAnd meanwhile, you've got her opponent, Joe Heck.\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. Don't boo——\nAudience members. Vote!\nThe President. Don't boo——\nAudience members. Vote!\nThe President. Don't boo——\nAudience members. Vote!\nThe President. Somebody asked me, he said, \"I voted. Can I boo now?\" [Laughter] I said, no, no, wait until all the votes are in. Go get some more folks to vote.\nBut Mr. Heck, he spent his time in Washington fighting for tax breaks for oil companies and billionaires like the Koch brothers. One of the things that's making this a tough race is they're sending millions of dollars here to try to elect him because they know that he's going to do what they want.\nSo when it comes to figuring out who's going to fight for you to make sure the economy works for you, you've got a choice. Think about what happened after the housing crisis. Nevada was hit harder than anybody else: tens of thousands of foreclosures, folks underwater. What did Catherine do? One of the first attorneys general in America to stand up for families facing the hardship of foreclosure. Rolled up her sleeves and got to work to make sure families got help. Cares about making sure minimum wage workers get a raise. She remembers her dad trying to makes ends meet in a low-paying job. Wants to make sure women get paid the same as men for doing the same work. Stands up for women and girls.\nHer opponent voted again and again to defund Planned Parenthood.\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. Don't boo, vote.\nThreatened to shut down the Government when he couldn't get his way, even though thousands of Nevada women depend on Planned Parenthood for basic health care, for cancer screenings. And then, just a few weeks ago, her opponent was supporting Donald Trump, who was bragging about actions that qualify as sexual assault.\nCatherine's been a national leader in the fight against sex trafficking of teenage girls and violence against women and passed laws to make sure the penalties are tougher for predators, expanded sex offender registries, gave victims the right to sue their captors. And the other guy is supporting Donald Trump. What the heck? [Laughter] What the heck? Heck, no! Heck, no! Heck, no!\nAudience members. Heck, no! Heck, no! Heck, no!\nThe President. [Laughter] Heck, no. Come on! Come on. On issue after issue, Nevada, you've got a clear choice.\nIf you care about immigration reform, you can vote for a Presidential candidate who sees immigrants only as \"criminals\" and \"rapists,\" apparently never heard of people like Catherine's grandfather. Or you can vote for the granddaughter of an immigrant, who believes that everybody deserves a chance to contribute to this country that we love.\nIf you care about criminal justice reform and disrupting the pipeline from underfunded schools to overcrowded jails, and helping people who served their time rehabilitate themselves and become productive members of society, you can vote for an outstanding prosecutor and attorney general who's used her power to make the justice system fairer and our people safer. Or you can vote for the other guy.\nAudience member. Heck, no!\nThe President. Heck, no.\nActually, there's one other difference between the candidates. Catherine never supported Donald Trump. She never said she had \"high hopes\" that he would become President. Never said she'd trust his fingers on the nuclear code. Now, I understand Joe Heck now wishes he never said those things about Donald Trump. But they're on tape. They're on the record. And now that Trump's poll numbers are cratering, suddenly, he says, well, no, I don't want to—I'm not supporting him.\nAudience member. Too late!\nThe President. Too late. You don't get credit for that. Let—I'm being serious here. Hold on a second. I want to make a point here. I know a lot of Republicans. I've got Republican friends, I've got members of my family who are Republicans, and they don't think the way Donald Trump does. I understand that. So I'm not generalizing about all Republicans. But here's the thing: For years, Republican politicians and the far-right media outlets have pumped up all kinds of crazy stuff about me, about Hillary, about Harry. They said I wasn't born here. They said climate change is a hoax. They said that I was going to take everybody's guns away. They said that, when we were doing military exercises that we've been doing——\nAudience member. Forever.\nThe President.——forever, suddenly, this was a plot to impose martial law. This is what they've been saying for years now. So people have been hearing it, and they start thinking, well, maybe this is true.\nAnd so if the world that they've been seeing is that I'm powerful enough to cause hurricanes on my own and to steal everybody's guns in the middle of the night and impose martial law, even though I can't talk without a prompter—[laughter]—then is it any wonder that they end up nominating somebody like Donald Trump?\nAnd the fact is, is that there are a lot of politicians who knew better. There are a lot of Senators who knew better. But they went along with these stories because they figured, you know what, this will help rile up the base, it will give us an excuse to obstruct what we're trying to do, we won't be able to appoint judges, we'll gum up the works, we'll create gridlock, it will give us a political advantage.\nSo they just stood by and said nothing. And their base began to actually believe this crazy stuff. So Donald Trump did not start this. Donald Trump didn't start it. He just did what he always did, which is slap his name on it, take credit for it, and promote it. That's what he does.\nAnd so now when suddenly it's not working and people are saying, wow, this guy is kind of out of line, all of a sudden, these Republican politicians who were okay with all this crazy stuff up to a point, suddenly, they're all walking away: \"Oh, this is too much.\"\nSo when you finally get them on tape bragging about actions that qualify as sexual assault and his poll numbers go down, suddenly that's a deal breaker. Well, what took you so long? What the heck? What took you so long? All these years—all these years you've been idolizing Ronald Reagan, and suddenly your Presidential nominee is kissing up to Vladimir Putin, a former KGB officer. You've got a bromance with him—that was okay. You're a Republican official that says you love the Constitution, say that Harry and I are engaging in unconstitutional behavior—power grabs, executive actions—but you then are okay with a President who says he'd silence reporters; in a debate, says he will jail his opponent without due process; wants to deport whoever he wants; apparently has not heard of the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments. Why would you support him? Why didn't you offer him your pocket Constitution, like Captain Khan's father did, if you care so much about the Constitution?\nAll these years you've said you stand for family values. I'm sure that's what Joe Heck said, said he stood for family values. But why didn't you walk away months ago when you heard your nominee for President, the guy you were hoping could become President, call women pigs, dogs, slobs; grades them not on their character or their intelligence, but on a scale of one to ten?\nYou don't have to be a husband or a father to stand up for women, for our daughters. You don't have to be—you don't have to have a disability to say it's wrong to mock somebody with a disability. You don't have to be a Muslim to stand up for our fellow citizens who are just as patriotic as we are. You don't have to be a Democrat to think there's a problem with that. You just have to be a decent human being. I mean it.\nAnd now the excuse they're using for why they should be elected is, \"Well, maybe we did support Trump, and now we're being kind of quiet about it, but you should vote Republican anyway because we'll check Hillary's power, we'll be a counterweight.\" No, no, no. No, all—listen, they have been in charge of Congress now for the last 6 years basically. And what have they gotten done?\nAudience members. Nothing!\nThe President. How have they helped you?\nAudience members. No way!\nThe President. When we tried to pass minimum wage increases, they weren't for that. They weren't for immigration reform. They are not willing to support early childhood education initiatives. Haven't built infrastructure. We could be putting guys to work right now—and gals back to work right now—got their hard hats on, ready to do work building Nevada, creating jobs all across this great State. They haven't done that. I've asked them. So a vote for them is basically more gridlock. That's their argument. That's not a good argument.\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. On issue after issue, Catherine Cortez Masto is going to be on your side, working for you.\nHer opponent is going to have Koch brothers on line one and Donald Trump on line two. [Laughter] When Donald creates his TV station, I'm sure Joe Heck will be up on there, giving interviews. [Laughter]\nEven after rescinding his endorsement of Trump, he said, \"I want to support him, I really do.\" Really? So how does that work? You're for him, but you're not for him. But you're kind of for him. What the heck? [Laughter] You can't object to the things that Trump says and what he stands for, where he starts undermining our democracy by saying he may not even accept the results of an election——\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. Don't boo——\nAudience members. Vote!\nThe President. And then say that you wish you could stick with him. That's not leadership, that's cynical.\nAudience members. Yeah!\nThe President. That means you'll say anything or be anybody just to get elected, depending on what's convenient at the time. And that's now what Nevada needs. And that's not what America needs. You need somebody who stands for principles like Catherine Cortez Masto. You need Members of Congress with principles, like Jacky Rosen, like Ruben Kihuen.\nAnd if you want that kind of representation, then you've got to go to iwillvote.com. And you've got to early vote. Because there's only one way to lose this election: if you fold your hand and don't vote. You've got the ace underneath, but if you don't turn it over, you'll lose. So you've got to vote. Audience member. It's my first time voting!\nThe President. Good! I'm proud of you. First-time voter right here. We need some more first-time voters. And we need some second-time voters, third and fourth and fifth and sixth-time voters. Do it big. Don't leaven any doubt. You don't—we don't want to leave any doubt.\nDonald Trump is already talking about how the game is rigged. I've got to say: That means he's losing. You know, if you start making—if you've ever played a basketball game and, like, halfway in the middle of the game, suddenly somebody starts saying, the refs are making me lose and I'm going to walk off the court—[laughter]—that means you're losing. And by the way, it means that you don't have what it takes to do this job, because there are a bunch of times where the—it gets tough. There are a lot of times where things don't go your way, and you've got to be able to just hang in there—the way Harry has hung in there, the way Hillary will hang in there. The way Catherine will hang in there.\nAnd in terms of this whole rigging thing, look, I mean, I don't have to tell you this, but I'll just go ahead and tell you anyway. [Laughter] Your Governor is a Republican. You've got Republican Governors in almost all the swing States, like Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, Georgia, Iowa. You've got Republican Governors in Texas and Arizona. In every polling place, there are Democrats and Republicans watching how the ballots are filled out and how they're turned in. There are Republicans and Democrats watching how they are counted. If this is rigged, boy, it would be a really big conspiracy. [Laughter] And those folks—the Republican Governor is not going to rig an election for Hillary Clinton or rig an election for Catherine. So forget the rigging talk.\nYou know what is going to win this election? You are. We have made so much progress, despite the forces of opposition and discrimination and the politics of backlash. We have made progress. We haven't gotten everything done. We've got more work to do. There are still folks out there who are struggling. We've still got roads and airports to build. We've got people to put back to work. We've got young people who need more help going to college. We've got early childhood education programs to set up. We got more clean energy to build. We've got immigration laws that need to be changed so we're a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. We've got work to do to bring together our outstanding law enforcement officials with those who want to make sure that our law enforcement is color blind.\nWe've got so much work to do. And so progress does not stop with my Presidency. It doesn't stop when Harry Reid retires. We're just getting started. We're just getting started. But we've got to make the right choice. Progress is on the ballot. Civility is on the ballot. Tolerance is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot. Equality is on the ballot. Democracy is on the ballot.\nMy name is not on the ballot——\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. That's okay. That's okay. But if you want to give me and Michelle a good sendoff, then I need you to join us. If you want to give Harry Reid a good sendoff, we've got to have a good turnout. I need you to work just as hard for Catherine Cortez Masto and just as hard for Hillary Clinton and just as hard for Ruben and Jacky as you worked for us.\nI need you to knock on doors. I need you to make phone calls. I need you to talk to your friends. I need you to vote early.\nAnd if you do that, we will elect Catherine Cortez Masto to be your next outstanding Senator. We will elect Hillary Clinton to be the next President of the United States. We'll show our kids that we are still the greatest nation on Earth! And we're just going to keep on getting better because of you!\nGod bless you, Vegas! Thank you. God bless the United States of America.", "timestamp": "2016-10-23", "title": "Remarks at a Campaign Rally for Democratic Presidential Nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton and Democratic Senatorial Candidate Catherine Cortez Masto in North Las Vegas, Nevada"}

Don't worry, I'll do all the acknowledgements. The mike is not working. I think they can all see me. If I can see them, they can see me. [Laughter] Just settle down. [Laughter] I know this is your house, but I've got this. I've done this a few times before. [Laughter]\nLet me begin by just saying thank you to Christine. She is such a dear friend. She has been there from the start when I was young and green behind the ears and no gray hair. [Laughter] She took me on as a project—[laughter]—and despite me being a little rough around the edges, she smoothed things out. And I still remember with great fondness that first event that we did here. At that time, we were campaigning for other Members of the Senate and trying to get—and Members of the House, trying to boost our majorities there and win back the majority in the Senate.\nAnd she has just been not only a tireless worker on behalf of progressive causes, but just a dear, dear friend. So I'm very grateful to her.\nSpeaking of tireless workers and dear friends, I said this before publicly—she may get tired of it, but I'm going to keep on saying it—whatever success that I've had as President of the United States, I owe in large part to the extraordinary skill, intelligence, acumen, toughness, and loyalty of the former Speaker and soon-to-be Speaker again of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi.\nA couple of outstanding current members of Congress that are here: first of all, Ben Ray Luján, who has taken on the tireless and thankless job of being the chairman of the DCCC; and one of your own from the great State of California, Susie Davis is here; and Scott Peters.\nAnd I like Christine's prognostications. They were right when it came to me, and I believe that she is right when we say that we're going to have an outstanding attorney—veteran, 32 years in the Marine Corps, combat duty, somebody who knows what it means to sacrifice on behalf of the Nation, and somebody who is going to be an outstanding Member of Congress—Doug Applegate.\nNow, I want to leave as much time as possible for questions, and some of you have been to these things before, so I'm not going to give a long speech. I just gave one in Nevada, which was fun.\nAudience member. We heard you.\nThe President. But I do want to just make a couple of quick remarks. Obviously, a lot has changed in the 8 years since I was sworn in as President, and a lot of you here are to be thanked for getting me there. We went from the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes to 15 million new jobs and a 5-percent unemployment rate, cutting it in half.\nLast year, we saw the largest increase in incomes ever recorded in a single year, and we saw the biggest drop in poverty since 1968. We have seen a housing market that's recovered, 401(k)s that have replenished themselves. We have doubled our production of clean energy, grown the economy while reducing carbon emissions faster than any other advanced nation. We have brought well over 100,000 troops back from Iraq and Afghanistan, taken out bin Laden, rolling back ISIL.\nWe've been able to reduce our dropout rates; our high school rates are higher than they ever have been before. College enrollment included among Latino and African Americans is the highest that it's ever been.\nAcross almost every economic index, we are better off than we were when we came in by a long shot. Not to mention 20 million people who have health insurance who didn't have it before.\nNow, a lot of that we got done because of really smart people in the White House who told me what to do. [Laughter] And I had enough sense to listen. But a lot of this got done because, in the first 2 years, when really the template for our economy and our foreign policy was being formed, at that moment where the well-being of this country was teetering, I had a congressional majority that was able to deliver; that was willing to take tough votes; that was willing to invest in an American auto industry that was on the brink of collapse, even when it was really unpopular; that was willing to invest in clean energy when the clean energy industry—solar, wind—was on the verge of collapse, insisted that we include that in our stimulus package, our recovery package; that made sure that Pell grants were available to millions more kids at a higher level than they had before.\nAgain and again, the House of Representatives was willing to take really tough votes, most prominently in passing the Affordable Care Act, despite the fact that folks knew that it might hurt them politically. Because it was the right thing to do. Because they believed that there's no point in getting elected if you're not actually delivering to the people who sent you there. That public service is just that: It is a service to the public. It is not a jobs program for yourself. [Laughter] It is not a means of getting on TV or parlaying it into some lucrative lobbying gig, but it is something you do because you believe in this country and you understand that this country only works when we're willing to make an investment in the next generation and we are willing to do tough things so that 20 years from now or 30 years from now or 50 years from now, people could look back and say, you know what, that was a responsible generation.\nNow, after Nancy Pelosi was no longer Speaker, Congress essentially shut down. And so much of the progress that we've done subsequently—for example, most recently this year with getting the Paris Agreement on climate change, and then we just followed up with two other agreements that bind countries internationally to reduce carbon emissions in airlines and making sure that we're not releasing really harmful HFCs into the atmosphere—those are things that we ended up having to do administratively.\nBut we didn't get any help from Congress. In fact, the House of Representatives and the Senate have been controlled by Republicans now for the last 2 years. Prior to that, the House of Representatives was controlled by Republicans for 4 years. And they couldn't get even their own stuff passed. [Laughter] I thought that for the last 2 years, I was going to spend a lot of time vetoing bills. I didn't have to. [Laughter] Because they are not even organized enough to get their own stuff down.\nAnd as a consequence, things that previously were never considered ideological—like rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our ports; putting people back to work; making our economy more productive—stalled. And in budget negotiations, because of Nancy's savvy, we've been able to at least embed in our budget some of the priorities of the American people. But we could be doing so much more. And that's why I'm working so hard, that's why Michelle is working so hard, that's why Joe Biden is working so hard as we exit the stage to make sure that we're passing the baton not only to Hillary Clinton, but also to a Congress that is willing to do the people's business.\nAnd there's no greater microcosm for why we need to get this done than the race that has already been mentioned between Doug Applegate and Darrell Issa.\nNow, I'm not going to belabor this point, but let me just point out that as far as I can tell, Doug [Darrell; White House correction.] Issa's primary contribution to the United States Congress has been to obstruct and to waste taxpayer dollar on trumped-up investigations that have led nowhere. And this is now a guy who, because poll numbers are bad, has sent out brochures with my picture on them—[laughter]—touting his cooperation on issues with me.\nNow, that is the definition of chutzpah. [Laughter] Here's a guy who called my administration perhaps the most corrupt in history—despite the fact that actually we have not had a major scandal in my administration—that, when Trump was suggesting that I wasn't even born here, said, well, I don't know, was not sure. We can pull up the quotes.\nThis guy has spent all his time simply trying to obstruct, to feed the same sentiments that resulted in Donald Trump becoming their nominee. I think somebody called Darrell Issa—was this you, Doug, who said Darrell Issa was Trump before Trump? [Laughter] And now he's sending out brochures touting his cooperation with me.\nNow, that is shameless. To his credit, I will say that he has been very pleasant to me at our Christmas parties. [Laughter] No, he is. I'm serious. I mean, he's said hello, and he's brought some of his family members, and I'm always happy to take pictures with family members. This is true—a number of Republican caucus members, like Michele Bachmann, they'll show up, and there's, like, good cheer and bipartisanship for one evening. Some of them say, I'm praying for you. [Laughter] And I don't question the sincerity that they are praying for me: Please, change this man from the socialist Muslim that he is. [Laughter] No, I'm sure it's more sincere than that. But beyond these interpersonal conversations, this is not somebody who is serious about working on problems.\nNow, you contrast it with Doug; he's shown himself to care about this country. He's made the investment in time and energy, putting himself at risk for our safety and our security. That's somebody you want in Congress. That's somebody you want in Congress. And if you extrapolate from that particular race to all the races that are taking place around the country, it is absolutely vital that we do everything we can to maximize turnout, to maximize enthusiasm, to make sure that we not only reject the kind of politics that Donald Trump represents, but we reject the climate inside the Republican Party that resulted in Donald Trump getting the nomination. And that starts in the House of Representatives.\nNancy will tell you, Susan will tell you, Scott will tell you—the things that you're hearing Trump saying, they're said on the floor of the House of Representatives all the time. The Freedom Caucus in the House of Representatives are repeatedly promoting crazy conspiracy theories and demonizing opponents.\nAnd so, as I said at the event in Vegas, Donald Trump didn't build that. He just slaps his name on it—[laughter]—and took credit for it. And the strongest message we can send—the message, by the way, that is most likely to get us past gridlock and give people some confidence that Government can work and Congress can work is if we have Nancy Pelosi as Speaker of the House, because Nancy knows how she can get things done and deliver on behalf of the American people.\nSo just to bring things full circle—Christine, I could not be more grateful for having helped start this amazing journey that we've been on. But if we're really going to bring it full circle, it means that we're assuring that the progress that we've made continues. And your presence here gives me confidence that we can make that happen.\nAll right? Thank you very much, everybody.", "timestamp": "2016-10-23", "title": "Remarks at a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Fundraiser in La Jolla, California"}

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119562", "text": "Aboard Air Force One\nEn Route Los Angeles, California\n12:51 P.M. PDT\nMR. EARNEST: How is everybody doing? I don't have anything at the top. Obviously, the President has spent a lot of time over the last 24 hours making a strong case about why it's important for people to be engaged in this election and what the stakes are in this election. And that's obviously the principal purpose of this trip. And I anticipate he'll have the opportunity to talk about that a little bit more on the program with Mr. Kimmel later this evening.\nSo with that, why don't we go to your questions, since we got a short flight here.\nQ: Josh, could you just talk a little bit about the President's plans over these last two weeks? And he's really focusing on talking about downstream races -- Senate, House. Could you talk a little bit about how he's going to drive that further over the next couple of weeks, how often he's going to be on the campaign trail, and maybe where besides, I guess -- is it Florida on Friday?\nMR. EARNEST: That's correct. I don't have any additional travel details to share at this point, but I would anticipate that the President will spend a significant amount of time traveling next week in support of not just Secretary Clinton's presidential campaign, but Democrats further down the ballot, as well.\nThe President's view is that the stakes in the election are high -- not just in terms of determining who will occupy the Oval Office for next few years, but how much success President Obama's successor will have in advancing their agenda through the Congress. So that would account for the President's passion for these issues.\nAnd, look, his own experience bears out how just important this is. In the President's first two years in office, the President was able to work effectively with a Democratic majority in the House and Senate to make progress on a whole range of issues that he had identified as high priorities. Since Republicans took control of the House and were joined by a Republican majority in the Senate, we've essentially seen the legislative process all but grind to a halt. And that is a function of Republican majorities that aren't interested in governing and don't appear to have much interest in trying to advance a conservative agenda. Rather, they seem focused on obstruction. And that kind of dysfunction has not served the American people well. And I think it's left the American electorate with a rather dim view of the current Republican representation in Congress.\nQ: Do you think he'll be out every day next week on the trail?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have details yet, but we should have some more details before the end of this week about what the President's schedule looks like next week. And I would expect the President to be quite active on the campaign trail.\nQ: Josh, does the President feel comfortable living in an America where Donald Trump is President?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think he alluded to this in his remarks over the last couple of days, indicating that despite the significant differences that he had with his opponents in 2008 and 2012, he had confidence that despite those vigorous disagreements, that those -- that both Senator McCain and Governor Romney would at least pursue the country's best interests as they saw it. He doesn't have that same kind of confidence about the current Republican nominee. And I think he's spoken to that in more colorful detail than I just did.\nQ: But, so given that, is there a place for -- does he feel like there's a place for him in this country if Donald Trump is elected President, given the doomsday terms that he's talked about this?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think you're sort of alluding to the rather poignant question of Captain Khan's father that was the tagline to that ad from the Democratic nominee. And, look, I think the kind of rhetoric that we've seen from the Republican nominee, the kinds of values that he claims to champion, I think raises questions in the minds of many Americans about whether or not he's committed to the kind of inclusive society that are consistent with long-held American values and are consistent with the kind of country that the vast majority of Americans actually want to live in.\nQ: So he wouldn't move to Canada or New Zealand if Donald Trump is elected?\nMR. EARNEST: He's working very hard to make sure that nobody has to move -- has to leave the country as a result of an electoral outcome that the President doesn't support.\nQ: Josh, do you have any response to Donald Trump saying that the battle for Mosul has been a failure?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I noticed those comments. What I can tell you is that our men and women in uniform who are serving this country in Iraq and Syria right now are putting their lives on the line to protect our national security. And the least that they should be able to expect from the American people and the people aspiring to be their Commander-in-Chief is their unconditional and unwavering support. That's certainly what they have from the current Commander-in-Chief. And those men and women on the ground in Iraq and in Syria have been executing a strategy that was formulated by President Obama and his national security team that put them in a position of offering their strong support to the Iraqi security forces that are on the frontlines of this battle.\nAnd the performance of those Iraqi security forces has improved dramatically over the last couple of years because of the kind of equipment that they've received from the United States and our coalition partners, because of the training that they've received from the United States and our counter-ISIL coalition partners, and because of the airstrikes that the United States and our coalition partners are taking to support their operations on the ground. They also benefit from the expertise and professionalism of our servicemembers on the ground who are offering them their advice and assistance as they take the fight to ISIL.\nSo we've indicated that the campaign against ISIL in Mosul will be a difficult one and it's likely to take some time, because ISIL has had two years to dig into that city, and we know that ISIL prizes their Mosul presence given that this is the second largest city in Iraq. So it's going to be a tough fight, but we're pleased -- and this is an operation that's only been underway for a week or so. But we're pleased with the progress they've made so far. There's a lot of important work that remains to be done. And our servicemembers are going to do the job that it takes to support them as they dislodge ISIL from Mosul.\nQ: Is it wrong or too early to say it's a failure on that specific point?\nMR. EARNEST: It's far too early to reach that kind of conclusion. We're pleased with the progress that we've made early on. And the President continues to be confident that because of the bravery and commitment of Iraqi security forces, with the strong support of the U.S. and our counter-ISIL coalition partners, that they will prevail.\nQ: Can we ask about the AT&T-Time Warner deal? Does the President or the White House have any reaction to that? And Bernie Sanders said the administration should stop it. Is that something that the White House is looking at?\nMR. EARNEST: The White House is not looking at this. This is a regulatory decision. And any decision to review the deal would be made by regulatory officials at the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission. It's possible that there's a role for the FCC, as well. But those federal regulators will do their job, and they'll determine whether or not a review is necessary.\nCertainly when you consider the size of this deal and its impact on the communications landscape, I don't think anybody would be surprised if they announced a review. But ultimately it would be up to them to make that determination.\nThe President would hope and expect that regulators would carefully consider the potential impact of this deal on consumers. But, again, all of that is something that is left to the discretion and judgment of independent regulators. So that's why the White House doesn't take a position on the deal.\nQ: The President has expressed his opinion on other regulatory issues facing -- but especially before the FCC -- thinking about the net neutrality specifically. And I know this is totally different from that, but is it something where you could see the President expressing an opinion at some point?\nMR. EARNEST: At this point, it's not something I foresee, again, because the President is committed to allowing these independent regulators to do their work. Look, I think the other part, the other factor here, Roberta, is that if the Department of Justice and/or the FTC were to announce a regulatory review, that's something that would -- that's a review that would last beyond the President's tenure in office. So I think that's the other reason the President is unlikely to weigh in on the merits of this particular arrangement.\nBut, again, the President -- any time these kinds of agreements are announced, the President believes it's important to be mindful of the impact that it could potentially have on consumers across the country. But, again, that's the purview of independent regulators, and the President has got confidence that they'll do their job.\nQ: Did the President let you win a few holes today on the golf course? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I know that there might be some people who would assume that coming to the back of the plane and talking to you about global issues is a lot of pressure. (Laughter.) That is nothing compared to standing on the first tee watching the Commander-in-Chief watch you address the ball -- particularly somebody who doesn't get the chance to hit the links as often as I would like. But it was a beautiful day, and the good people at Torrey Pines ensured that we had a nice time and were very hospitable.\nThey've also got a pretty good thing going there. The views of the Pacific Ocean from the bluffs on the course totally lives up to the hype.\nQ: Could you talk about when the President says that it's important for Democrats to win big and for Hillary to win big -- what exactly does he mean? I know why -- I know the rationale that he's laying out. But, I mean, how big of a victory does she have to have in order, does he think, for the values that he's talking about to have been vindicated and to repudiate the argument?\nMR. EARNEST: I genuinely don't think the President has a specific number in mind. But I think what the President has in mind is the idea that the American people, that voters across the country would send a clear message to Republicans who have not been engaged in trying to govern the country. They've been engaged in waging small-minded political fights that are focused on obstruction. And that's led the party to nominate somebody that doesn't seem particularly committed to a conservative governing philosophy and really is famous for his ability to colorfully articulate his opposition to President Obama.\nSo I think the President is hopeful that the American people will take the opportunity before them in the context of this election and send a clear message to both parties that there are some basic things that, despite the significant differences between Democrats and Republicans in Washington, D.C., there should be an opportunity to move forward in those areas where there is common ground. And so the President is hopeful that people will make clear that Republicans can't just pursue a political strategy that's focused on obstruction, but that they have a responsibility, particularly if they hold on to the majority in Congress, to actually pursue an agenda that they believe is in the best interest of the country and is not just focused on their own political self-interest.\nQ: Josh, the VP and you and others in the White House and around him have made a big point of the fact that he got over 50 percent in his elections and why that was significant. Does Hillary Clinton need to get over 50 percent? I know you say he doesn't have a particular number in mind -- but that number to be with the majority of the country, to do what he wants her to be able to do coming off the election?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't think the President has a number in mind. But I think the President, as you can tell from the passion of his case, and as you will see from the days that he intends to spend on the road leading up to the election, that he's determined to get her as many votes as possible.\nQ: Is 50 percent not an important benchmark for her?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously the President was proud of the majority support that he's gotten from the voters in both races that he's run. And I think the President is interested in building as much support as he possibly can for Secretary Clinton.\nQ: Can I ask a Project Veritas question? There's a new video out today that shows Bob Creamer talking to someone about this so-called \"Donald Duck\" initiative -- whatever -- where people would dress up as Donald Duck and follow Trump around because he was ducking his taxes. Anyway, Bob Creamer is on video saying that Secretary Clinton, herself, approved this idea. The question is, do you think it is appropriate for someone who has been to the White House a number of times to be engaging in this kind of conduct?\nMR. EARNEST: First of all, as you report on these videos I would just caution you to consider the history of this organization. Oftentimes when these videos are released, they reflect not a true representation of that person's views but rather distort that person's views in a way that make it actually more difficult to understand what they're talking about.\nSo that being said, I'm going to leave it to the respective campaigns and to the respective political party organizations to comment on the kinds of tactics that they're using on the campaign trail. I think the tactic that you alluded to is something that we've seen in presidential campaigns at least as long as I've been involved in them. And the truth is, you see those in other races, too, that are not as -- that even state and local campaigns will use those kinds of tactics to highlight the weakness of one particular candidate or another.\nBut whether or not that's appropriate, I'll let the candidates speak to it.\nQ: Is it true that the President has given up and decided not to do anything on Syria before the next President takes office? There was a report today in The Washington Post on that.\nMR. EARNEST: I saw the report. I think what is clear in the news story and is consistent with what I've been saying all along, which is that the President is not going to take any ideas off the table. And he certainly is going to consider a range of options as we work to deescalate the violence, increase the flow of humanitarian assistance, and try to kick-start talks for a political transition inside of Syria. And I'm not going to take any options off the table in terms of potential presidential decisions between now and January 20th.\nQ: Was the report right in that he's not going to do anything in terms of beefing up some of these existing programs before handing it over to the next President?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't remember exactly the way that it was phrased in the story. I think what I would say is just that the President has a range of options that he'll consider to pursue the goals that I just mentioned, and he has not ruled out using any of them at this point. He's going to continue to consult with his national security team. Some of the activities that have been speculated about are things that obviously I can't discuss in this setting, but there are a range of options that are available to the President. And he's obviously quite interested in seeing the violence be reduced and the flow of humanitarian assistance increased in that region of the world. There are people there who are suffering.\nAnd I think the thing that we're certainly going to continue to do is engage diplomatically, both on a bilateral basis with some countries in the region that obviously have a vested stake in the outcome there, but there's also some work that we can continue to do multilaterally, through the U.N. and through the ISSG, to try to reach the kind of outcome that we believe is in the best interest of the people in the region, but also the best interest of our national security as well.\nSo that certainly is the approach the President is going to continue to pursue. Additional decisions I wouldn't take off the table at this point.\nAll right. Thank you, guys. Buckle up for landing.\nEND 1:09 P.M.

{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "note": "Remarks as delivered.  Both Secretary Clinton and Congresswoman Elizabeth Warren were introduced by Margaret Hassan, the Governor of New Hampshire and currently running for the US Senate.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119688", "text": "Thank you – Wow! Well, I don't know about you, but I could listen to Elizabeth Warren go on all day! It is so great to be back here in New Hampshire! I have a significant unruly group of women I went to Wellesley with back here.\nOh, it is so wonderful to be here on this college campus, and to see so many young people here as Maggie and Elizabeth and I were walking up to the stage. And a lot of people were hanging out of the windows, and we're glad that you've got the best view of what we're doing here.\nIt's also exciting to be here with two weeks left because this is the most consequential election of our lifetime, and to see the energy and enthusiasm that this crowd displayed – I saw it yesterday in North Carolina, I saw it the day before in Ohio, it really does demonstrate that Americans are really looking at what's at stake and are coming to the conclusion that we all have to be involved in the remaining days of the campaign. And that everyone needs to turn out to vote.\nIn New Hampshire, you have a lot of reasons to vote – you've got great candidates for Congress, Annie Kuster and Carol Shea Porter, who deserve your support, and you've got a great candidate for governor, Colin Van Ostern, thank you!\nI know that Maggie, and Elizabeth and I have been out here giving the full dose, but I hope that you will know what is at stake in the governor's race, and in sending these two extraordinary women to the House, and boy, it is exciting to be here with Maggie and Elizabeth because they are people who fight for you every single day. I know these women, and it is a privilege to be on this stage with them.\nNow, Elizabeth Warren has a track record of making it her mission to stand up against Wall Street. And she is going to make sure that Wall Street never wrecks Main Street again!\nBut you may not know that she was the person behind setting up the agency that protects consumers. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and it was set up to stand against and to do something about the kinds of fraud and abuse we've seen from Wells Fargo. And they are on the front lines of returning billions of dollars to Americans who have been cheated and defrauded by big companies, by banks and others.\nIn fact, I think it is fair to say some of the best TV that you can see is on C-SPAN when Elizabeth is going after a bank executive or regulator. She is refusing— refusing to let them off the hook, and she is not just speaking for herself, is she? She is speaking for every single American who is frustrated and fed up. And I am so looking forward to working with her to rewrite the rules of our economy to make sure we both grow it and make it fairer for every single person working hard here in America.\nI know we are up here without our phones so we cannot check tweets but – I kind of expect if Donald heard what she just said, he is tweeting away. She gets under his thin skin like nobody else. Whether she is calling him out of his mysterious tax returns, she exposes him for what he is – temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president of the United States. And Maggie is going to be a great United States senator for New Hampshire. You do not have to take my word or Elizabeth's word. Look at what she has already done. Under Maggie's leadership, New Hampshire has the lowest unemployment rate in the entire country.\nDuring her governorship, it was ranked as the best state in the country for business, and she has done it the New Hampshire way. She has brought people together, Democrats and Republicans, and Independents, and I think she has the biggest legislature, probably in the world, that she has to deal with. So she has really honed her skills – listening and trying to work with people, and she has taken issues that do keep families up at night. From the sky rocketing costs of college and prescription drugs , to helping students to figure out ways to afford to get their education to helping those suffering from addiction or mental health, to raising wages for hard working families. What I love about Maggie is that she is independent, she knows how to find common ground, and how to stand her ground. And that is exactly the kind of leader we need in the United States Senate.\nBecause we've got to break through the gridlock and dysfunction that has unfortunately marred Washington. We have to get back to listening respectfully. We can disagree without being disagreeable. And that is why we need leaders like Maggie, and unlike her opponent, she has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.\nShe knows he should not be a role model for our kids or anybody else for that matter. So I hope in these next 14 days, you do everything you can to support her. And I want to say a word about Colin, who I have also known for a number of years now. And Maggie is leaving some big shoes. She does not look like it, but she is, she is leaving some big shoes to fill as governor. Colin is the person for that job. You know as a member of Executive Council, and I remember this because it took a lot of guts.\nHe helped lead the fight for funding Planned Parenthood in New Hampshire. Against his opponent by the way, and he has showed that he will stand up for women's health 100 percent of the time, not just when it is politically convenient. He also worked with Maggie to cross party lines to help expand Medicaid to more than 50,000 granted stators.\nAnd Colin wants to do more to invest clean energy like wind and solar to hold down energy costs to create more good jobs here in New Hampshire and to protect the beautiful environment of this state. And he will fight to put into action the promise of higher education within reach for more families. So please during these next days, make sure you're doing everything you can for Colin, for Carol, and for Annie.\nNow did anybody see the last debate? I stood next to Donald Trump in three debates for four and a half hours proving once again, I have the stamina to be president. I've tried to use the time I had in all three to talk about what people talk to me about, starting here in New Hampshire and going across the country, because I take it really seriously.\nI think that the problems that keep you up tonight, that stand in the way of your getting ahead and staying ahead, of providing the best opportunity of a good middle class job with a rising income for you and your kids, those are the problems that someone running for president should actually listen to, pay attention to and come up with solutions for.\nSo, you know, I do have a lot of plans, I do. And I get criticized for having so many plans. Tim Kaine and I have actually written a book – oh, there's one copy right there! It's called – oh, another copy! It's called 'Stronger Together,' and we lay out all of our plans for what we want to do if we're so honored as to be president and vice president. And, you know, I do have this old-fashioned idea that if I'm here asking for your vote to be your president, I should tell you what I'm going to do, and maybe, as I said yesterday in North Carolina, maybe it's a bit of a women's thing because we make lists. We do, we make lists and we try to write down what we're supposed to do and then cross them off as we go through the day and the week. And so, I want you think about our plans are as our lists – our lists as a country.\nWe are going to get our economy working for everybody, not just those at the top. We are going to make college affordable. We are going to lower prescription drug costs, and we're going to do everything we can to keep faith with what we have said we're going to do. What a novel idea! We're actually going to try to deliver results for you.\nBut I got to tell you. During that debate, Donald said something. Well, he said a lot of things that were troubling, but he said something truly horrifying. He became the first person running for president – Republican or Democrat – who refused to say that he would respect the results of this election. Now, that is a direct threat to our democracy. I'm not going to try to call it anything else because that's what it is. All this talk about the election being rigged, trying to stir up people who are supporting him at his rallies, that is a direct threat to our democracy. And I got to tell you – as your secretary of state, I went to 112 countries and I went to countries where people were jailed for being political opponents, where they were exiled, where they were killed. I take this really seriously.\nAnd for me, the peaceful transfer of power is one of the things that makes our country great – something that – something we can't lose, something we shouldn't even doubt. We cannot give in to cynicism, and I don't think we are. I'll tell you what's exciting to me is across this country, at the very moment Donald Trump is making this unprecedented attack on our fundamental values, our institutions, millions of people are standing up for democracy, registering, volunteering, voting early.\nSo when you get a little discouraged or you get frustrated by what you see in this campaign, think of this: we have just reached a historic milestone. More than 200 million Americans are now registered to vote. And most exciting, that includes more than 50 million young people, the biggest number ever. Now you only see numbers like this when people are standing up for what they believe in and I'm proud to see Americans coming together – Democrats, Republicans and Independents – to reject hate and division. And we're seeing that in New Hampshire, too.\nWe are more than our disagreements, we Americans. There is so much more that unites us than divides us. I'm proud to have the support of more than 150 Republican leaders in this state who put country before party. But this energy we're seeing is not just because of what we're against, as important as that is, it's because what we're for. It's about fighting for a future where everyone counts, where everyone has a place, and no one is left out or left behind.\nBecause to me, and I hope to you as well, this is about more than winning an election, it's about the kind of country we want for our kids and our grandkids. That's what this has to be about. It's about the lessons we want to pass on to our sons and our daughters. You know, we believe we should honor the men and women who fight for our country and that America is safer when we work with our allies to lead the world with strength and intelligence. Yet my opponent attacked a grieving Gold Star family whose son died in Iraq. He has no plan to defeat ISIS. And just last night he tweeted that the new effort underway to push the terrorists out of the key city of Mosul is already, and I quote, 'a total disaster.' And that our country is, quote, 'looking so dumb.' Imagine, imagine, this is a guy who says he knows more about ISIS than the generals. I don't think so. He's basically declaring defeat before the battle has even started. He's proving to the world what it means to have an unqualified commander in chief. It's not only wrong, it's dangerous, and it needs to be repudiated on November the 8th here in New Hampshire and across America.\nBut just in case you think that this is new for Donald, it shouldn't surprise you or anybody else, and I'll tell you why. He has been denigrating America for decades. It started before he campaigned against me. It started before President Obama took office. In fact, back in 1987, he spent $100,000 on an ad in The New York Times criticizing President Reagan. He said, and I quote, 'The world is laughing at America.' Does that sound familiar? This is someone who roots for failure and takes glee in mocking our country no matter who our president is. Now that may be who Donald Trump is, but this election is about who we are. And I want us – I want us to remember, America is great because America is good, right? And as our wonderful First Lady Michelle Obama said right here in New Hampshire, 'When they go, we go high.'\nThis election poses a very clear choice on the economy. When the middle class thrives, America thrives. As Elizabeth said, she is a perfect example of how that works in America. So am I. So are every one of you here. That's what I want for every single person, especially young person, in America. With your help, we're going to not only have Elizabeth back in the Senate, but send Maggie, send Carol, send Annie and then make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II.\nWhat does that mean? That means jobs in infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our mass transit, our water systems. There is a lot of great work to be done here. And guess what? Those are jobs that can't be exported. They've got to be done, right here in New Hampshire and across America. I want us to invest in advanced manufacturing, and there are, I know, a lot of skeptics about that. They say, 'Well, we can't compete in manufacturing anymore.' Well, I'll tell you what. I don't want us competing with low wage jobs. I want us competing for the high wage jobs. Germany is a major exporter of advanced manufacturing products. I want to compete with Germany and countries like that, precision, machining, 3D printing.\nI want us to invest more in technology, innovation and research and yes, in clean energy, because we're going to make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. I think we can deploy a half a billion more solar panels within the first four years and enough clean energy to power every home by the end of 10 years. That's what I want people to be working on and thinking about and striving to achieve.\nAnd I am really excited about what we can do to make sure every young American is prepared. I want to start in the early years of life in early education, universal pre-K. I want kids to be prepared to succeed. Because we are in a competition, and you know what? I want us to step up and compete and win. And I want our schools – I want kids to have good teachers and good schools in every zip code, and I want to be a good partner with our teachers and our educators here in New Hampshire. And I want to bring back technical education to high school. I think we really – we really shut the door on too many young people who could've gotten skills that would've given them the chance to get ahead.\nAnd working with our community colleges, we need to make sure that every young person and every person coming back to upgrade or change skills can go to a community college. And yes, we are going to make four-year college affordable. Just this week, a new report came out showing that New Hampshire students have very high levels of debt, and I know Maggie has been fighting that. And she's had a moratorium, and she's done what she could at the state level. But we got to work together at the national level to make this happen for students in New Hampshire, families in New Hampshire.\nSo after our primary was over – and you know what, I was really proud – I was really proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran. And it was a campaign – it was a campaign about ideas, not insults. And that's what campaigns should be about. And after it was over, Bernie and I got together. We put our heads together. And we came up with a plan to make public colleges and universities tuition free for any families making less than $125,000 a year. And if you make more than that, it will be debt free. In other words, pay what you can, but let's not have kids and families going into debt to get an education. This should be an investment that we make on behalf of them and our country's future. And no matter where you go, to a great school like this, or anywhere else, we will help you pay down your student debt. We will make is easier, because we a re going to make it as a percentage of you income, so you will never be on the hook for more than you can afford. And if your interested to see how much you and your family can save, you can actually go to hillaryclinton.com/calculator to see how much you can save under this plan that we are proposing.\nNow, I think in addition to growing the economy, we need to do a lot more on small business. Two-thirds of new jobs will come from small business so we are going to be just focused on how we are going to be able to start and grow your small business. And then we do have to make the economy fairer, and that starts with raising the national minimum wage, because if you work full time, I am talking about full time workers, you should not still be in poverty at the end. Work should provide a ladder of opportunity for people willing to work for it to climb. Right?\nWe are going to guarantee equal pay, we are going to make affordable child care so nobody pays more than 10 percent of your income for childcare. We are going to work for paid family leave. Because this is the way families are today. We are not living in the 1950s. Families are under new stresses and strains, and I meet so many who are really just at the edge. They are making all they can make. One parent working full-time, two parents working full-time, sometimes part-time on top of full-time.\nThe other day, Tim Kaine and I were in Pittsburgh. There was a long line of people, big overflow, which we couldn't get into the main room where we were. So, Tim was talking to the families there, and there was a woman holding her three-year-old child, a daughter, I think. Tim was shaking hands, and the woman looked and she said, 'I came here hoping that I could tell you or Secretary Clinton that I had my baby three years ago, and the day after, I had my baby, I was fired because I called and ask if I could have a few weeks because it had been a difficult pregnancy. But my baby was fine but not all that she needed to be. I got fired.' And Tim came in, and he is such a wonderful man. What a fine human being. And he said, 'To be there are the reasons everyday why I get so motivated in this election, and I just have another reason.' He told me that story. I think your president should care about that. I think your president should wake up everyday thinking, 'Okay, how do I help empower the most people to make the most out of their own lives, how to break down the barriers that give you the chance to go as far as your hard work and talent will take you?' Sometimes people say, 'How are you going to get all this done?' I have proposed plans that do not add a penny to the debt because I see some of my long time friends who back in the 1992 campaign – where my husband ended up, we had a balance budget and a surplus, and actually, we were on the way to paying down the national debt, but here is what happened.\nWhat happened is trickle-down economics came back. So here is what I am going to do. We are going to ask the wealthy to finally pay their fair share. We are going to – we are going to close the loopholes, we are going to end the fact that millionaires can pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or a teacher or a police officer. We are going to make big banks pay for the risks they pose to our economy because Elizabeth is absolutely right. No – no bank is too big to fail, and no one should be above the law, and we are going to enforce that and contrast that with Donald Trump. He believes that if you give trillions and that is trillions with a 't' in tax cuts to the wealthy millionaires and billionaires and corporations, and everything will work out.\nWell, it will for him. That is trickle down economics on steroids. And he would wipe away the tough new rules that President Obama imposed on Wall Street. He would eliminate the Consumer Protection Financial Bureau that Elizabeth did so much to create. And you know that was bad enough, but then in the debates, we learned he hasn't paid any income tax for years. So he hasn't paid a penny to support our military, our veterans, Pell grants for kids to get an education, health or anything else. And his explanation was he lost a billion dollars in a year. Now, I've pondered this. I've really pondered this. He actually said it made him smart not to pay income taxes, but how smart are you to lose a billion dollars in a year?\nHas anyone here been to a casino? He lost a billion dollars running casinos. Who does that? I've never heard of anybody. So, we've got to make it clear that Donald is not on the side of America workers or American families. For all of his talk about putting America first, he makes his products in at least 12 other countries. He stiffs small businesses, mom and pop contractors who work for him. My dad was a small business owner. He worked really hard. I'm just glad he never got a contract from Donald Trump because it was hard work, and people who do that work should be rewarded, not taken advantage of.\nSo we know a lot about how Donald Trump works, and today, today, we heard yet another story. It's about a maintenance worker at one of his golf courses. This maintenance courses told his co-workers he was gay, and they started harassing him. They used anti-gay slurs to his face, they threw rocks and golf balls at him, his supervisor saw it and did nothing, and it got so bad, he wound up in the hospital. Finally, he went to the police for help. He couldn't go back to work because he was too scared for his safety, and then he was fired by Trump's golf club. Now, this is a heart-wrenching story on a lot of levels. For starters, it's a painful reminder of the harassment, violence, and discrimination that too many LGBT Americans still face every day. And it is deeply disturbing that instead of stepping in to stop the tormentors, Trump's golf club turned on the victim for coming forward. If that's how Donald Trump runs his business, what does that say about how he would run our country?\nSo my friends, there are lots of reasons, so many, to take this election seriously. But here's what I want you to know: of course, I want you to vote for all of us, but more than that, I want you to vote for yourselves, and for your families, and for your hope for our future together. Because if you believe women and girls should be treated with dignity and respect and women should be able to make our own health care decisions, and marriage equality should be protected, and that we have to take on the epidemic of substance abuse, disorders, and addiction. If you believe in a foreign policy where we work with our allies, not insult them, and achieve common goals towards peace and prosperity, then you have to vote. All of these issues are on the ballot this November, and I believe with all of my heart, that we will after this election, get together to help heal the divides that have sprung up and are so painful among us.\nSo please register and vote on the same day. Go to iwillvote.com to confirm your polling place. Come help us these last two weeks. Go to hillaryclinton.com, sign up to volunteer, take out your phone, text 'JOIN,' J-O-I-N to 47246 and get everybody you know to come out and vote. I think this election is going to turn on who is motivated to vote so we need each and every one of you to do everything you can to make it clear to everybody you know that our future is at stake. If you ought to be part of a positive, optimistic, confident, unifying future, please come out to vote on November 8th here in New Hampshire, and prove once and for all that love trumps hate.\nThank you all!", "timestamp": "2016-10-24", "title": "Remarks at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122622", "text": "Following President Obama's March 2012 call to strengthen federal efforts to combat human trafficking, the President's Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (PITF) has convened leaders from government, the private sector, advocates, survivors, communities of faith, civil society, law enforcement, and academia to implement a coordinated agenda that helps prevent trafficking, protect victims, and prosecute offenders.\nToday, Secretary of State John Kerry and other members of the PITF met at the White House to report on the progress made within four priority areas: rule of law, victim services, procurement and supply chains, and public awareness and outreach. This was the seventh and final cabinet-level meeting of the PITF during the Obama Administration.\nWhile more work is required to tackle the root causes and consequences of human trafficking, the United States continues to be a leader in the global movement to end modern slavery. By working together, sharing information, and partnering with a broad range of organizations, the U.S. government continues to explore new and innovative approaches to end the plight of trafficking victims. The Administration has built a robust program to achieve the President's vision:\n•      We have built internationally-recognized anti-trafficking training, including through the Blue Campaign, that is regularly delivered to thousands of federal employees, state and local law enforcement, U.S. embassies overseas, human trafficking task forces, a range of private sector industries, and community groups both in person and online.\n•      Our diplomatic efforts in conjunction with the annual Trafficking in Persons Report have encouraged the passage, amendment, and implementation of anti-trafficking laws in scores of countries and drawn attention to global trends and emerging issues such as combating trafficking in global supply chains and increasing survivor engagement.\n•      Throughout this Administration, federal law enforcement agencies have initiated over 6,000 human trafficking cases and secured over 4,000 convictions. Additionally, law enforcement investigations have identified over 2,000 victims of human trafficking – a statistic that is now available through the Victim Assistance Database, a resource that did not exist prior to December 2011. Several departments have increased resources addressing trafficking in underserved populations, including the LGBT and American Indian and Alaskan Native communities.\n•      The U.S. Advisory Council on Human Trafficking, announced by the President last year, released its first annual report last week. The report contains specific policy recommendations, providing the federal government with survivor-informed analysis to combat human trafficking. The Council is comprised of 11 survivors of human trafficking and together they represent a diverse range of backgrounds and experiences.\nToday, the White House is proud to announce the recipients of the 2016 Presidential Award for Extraordinary Efforts to Combat Trafficking in Persons: Students Opposing Slavery and Dr. Christopher White. Students Opposing Slavery is a student-led network committed to empowering young leaders and raising awareness about trafficking among youth – a demographic vulnerable to human trafficking. Dr. White led DARPA's research resulting in the development of Memex technologies to provide governmental entities with new capabilities to uncover and defeat human trafficking enterprises.\nWe are also pleased to announce the third challenge in the Partnership for Freedom competition, Pathways to Freedom, which will challenge local communities to shift practices, policies, and perceptions so that all survivors of human trafficking receive the respect, support, and opportunities they deserve. The Partnership for Freedom is a public-private partnership announced by President Obama to spur innovative solutions to problems caused by modern slavery.\nRule of Law\n•      The Department of Justice continues to return record prosecution results. In FY 2016, DOJ initiated a total of 241 human trafficking prosecutions, charging 531 defendants. During FY 2016, DOJ convicted 439 defendants in human trafficking prosecutions.\n•      In FY 2016, the FBI investigated 1,894 cases involving the domestic and international trafficking of adult and juvenile victims for purposes of commercial sex and forced labor. Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security initiated 1,025 human trafficking cases and identified 435 victims of human trafficking.\n•      The FBI currently operates 74 Child Exploitation Task Forces and is part of over 100 task forces and working groups nationwide that collaboratively address the human trafficking threat.\n•      The Justice Department also awarded $15.8 million in grant funding to the multi-disciplinary partnerships of Enhanced Collaborative Model (ECM) anti-trafficking task forces across the United States. ECM task forces are comprised of federal, state and local law enforcement, labor officials, prosecutors, victim service providers, and other allied professionals.\n•      Anti-discrimination laws enforced by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission are an integral part of the fight against trafficking. In the past year, EEOC resolved two lawsuits involving hundreds of victims of national origin discrimination and labor trafficking.\n•      Justice and Homeland Security continue to collaborate with Mexican law enforcement counterparts through the U.S.-Mexico Human Trafficking Bilateral Enforcement Initiative. In June 2016, five defendants charged in the United States with operating a sex trafficking enterprise were extradited to the United States from Mexico.\n•      The Intelligence Community (IC) is working on the first National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on global human trafficking. The estimate will look at the impact of conflict and crises on human trafficking flows, as well as the drivers that increase the likelihood of trafficking. The NIE will be published during the Presidential transition period.\nVictim Services\n•      In FY 2016, the Department of Health and Human Services provided more than $20 million in grant funding to community-based organizations to assist victims of trafficking. Grantees served more than 2,378 victims of trafficking and family members through a network of organizations in 241 sites in 39 states. This represents a 40 percent increase in clients served from the previous year.\n•      Additionally, in FY 2016, Health and Human Services certified 444 adult and 340 minor foreign national victims of trafficking to access services, almost triple the number of total victims connected to services since the beginning of the Administration.\n•      In September, the Department of Justice awarded more than $49 million in funding to support anti-human trafficking initiatives and research. Through these awards, service providers are building multi-disciplinary partnerships that provide a wide range of services for survivors of trafficking, enhancing the capacity of anti-trafficking stakeholders and allied professionals through training and technical assistance, and expanding legal assistance.\n•      The Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Justice are collaborating to identify existing wide-ranging service programs in Miami and New York that survivors of human trafficking can access, and developing employment- and training-focused networks between victim service providers and existing resources at a local level.\n•      The Department of the Interior partnered with tribal law enforcement to form the first-ever Tribal Human Trafficking Task Force. The Task Force is a partnership with tribal law enforcement and courts, the State Attorney General's Office, the United States Attorney's Office, victim service providers, and Stop Violence Against Native Women, an NGO.\n•      In March 2016, the State Department issued new mandatory standards for all employees under Chief of Mission Authority who hire personal domestic workers. These regulations require additional contractual protections to help ensure those representing our country abroad adhere to standards that measure up to the bar set by the international community.\n•      Immigration and Customs Enforcement updated its Continued Presence directive to make Continued Presence a two-year status in the United States for non-citizen human trafficking victims, renewable in increments of up to two years. Continued Presence is a temporary immigration status that allows trafficking victims to remain in the United States during the investigation of the crime committed against them. Extending this status to two years helps provide stability for trafficking victims while alleviating administrative burdens on victims, service providers, and the government.\nProcurement and Supply Chain\n•      On February 24, 2016 the President signed the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015, which strengthened the Customs and Border Protection's (CBP) ability to prevent products made with forced labor from entering the United States. CBP has withheld the release of products from four different companies since passage of this law and established a Forced Labor Task Force.\n•      Under the auspices of the Supply Unchained program, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is partnering with groups to identify patterns and those most at risk of trafficking. USAID invested in a partnership with the Blue Moon Fund to support activities designed to provide more information about challenges faced by workers on fishing vessels. The Stop Trafficking by Sea project will connect worker organizations to those working at sea, offering support services as well as gathering more information to draw a more complete picture of forced labor risk and how to combat it.\n•      The State Department plans to dedicate more than $2.8 million in funding to support new programs to address human trafficking in the Southeast Asia seafood sector and expand ResponsibleSourcingTool.org to include advanced training to prevent and address forced labor in global supply chains, new resources, and additional risk-management tools for new industries beyond the seafood section.\nPublic Awareness and Outreach\n•      In FY 2016, the Department of Homeland Security's Blue Campaign created new public awareness materials for broader audiences. New materials include \"What is Human Trafficking\" posters and infographics in multiple languages.\n•      The Blue Campaign entered into agreements with an unprecedented number of government and nongovernmental entities to further collaborate in raising awareness and combating human trafficking, including formal partnerships with the City of Los Angeles, California Hotel and Lodging Association, San Joaquin Regional Rail Commission, D.C. Mayor's Office of Human Rights, North Dakota Public Health Association, City of Houston, and the Virginia Office of Attorney General.\n•      The Department of Justice released Faces of Human Trafficking – a video series, discussion guide, fact sheets, and posters – for service providers, law enforcement, prosecutors, and other community stakeholders. The series includes information about sex and labor trafficking, multidisciplinary approaches to serving victims of human trafficking, victim services, victims' legal needs, and voices of survivors, and is available online.\n•      The Department of Transportation and Homeland Security co-hosted a stakeholder event on human trafficking and implemented training for over 70,000 airline employees through the Blue Lightning Initiative. The Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization that the President signed in July 2016 includes a requirement for air carriers to train flight attendants on indicators of human trafficking and on how to report suspected human trafficking, and Transportation and Homeland Security are reaching out to carriers to encourage adoption of the program. Additionally, Transportation will continue to work with stakeholders across all modes of transportation in the Transportation Leaders Against Human Trafficking group.\n•      In 2016, the Department of Education provided training to superintendents, teachers, counselors, State liaisons on homelessness, and non-governmental organizations on how trafficking relates to teaching and learning and why it is important for schools to address it. Education encouraged schools to embed trafficking in their emergency operations and management planning through the agency's technical assistance centers and an on-line community of practice. In 2017, Education will work with Health and Human Services and Justice to create training materials aimed at school staff and students.\nAdditional references:\nPresident Obama Announces Members of United States Advisory Council on Human Trafficking  here.

Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, in their respective capacities as the 2008 and 2012 Republican Presidential nominees; former Speaker of the House of Representatives John A. Boehner; and Sen. Marco A. Rubio.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119537", "text": "The President. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you. You're still fired up, still ready to go! Thank you so much. Everybody, have a seat. Have a seat. I've got a few things to say.\nFirst of all, I just want to thank Mark and Hanna for opening up this spectacular home. Please give them a big round of applause. In addition, we've got one of the outstanding Members of Congress who has had my back on a bunch of tough stuff, Scott Peters. Where's Scott? There he is.\nSo I'm trying to figure out why I didn't move to—[laughter]—San Diego right now. I'm looking around and I'm thinking somewhere I took a wrong turn—[laughter]—and I didn't end up here, looking out over the Pacific Ocean. It looks pretty good.\nAudience members. Yes!\nAudience member. And the golf course.\nThe President. And the golf course is good too. [Laughter] But it's not too late. Well, Michelle and I will have to do some negotiations, but—[laughter]. Because it is true our lease is running out. [Laughter] So we've been going around, checking to make sure that Bo and Sunny didn't ruin the carpet and—[laughter]. Because we want our security deposit back when we leave. [Laughter]\nBut listen, it's wonderful to be here. When I came here in 2005, I was a Senator and was campaigning for other Senators. In 2007, I was just beginning my race for the Presidency. And there were so many good friends here in San Diego who were early investors in a guy who—whose name nobody really could pronounce. [Laughter] And fast-forward 8 years later, you think about the incredible journey that we've taken.\nWhen I took office, we were on the verge of a Great Depression: the worst financial and economic crisis of my lifetime and most people's lifetimes here. We were losing 800,000 jobs a month. The financial system was locked up. It was global, not just national. People were losing their homes, their pensions.\nEight years later, we've created 15 million new jobs. We have cut the unemployment rate in half; 401(k)s have recovered. We have provided health insurance for 20 million Americans who didn't have it before. And for those who already had health insurance, now you can't be barred because of a preexisting condition. Women can't be charged more than men just for being a woman. Preventive care, mammograms are all covered. Young people can stay on their parent's plan up until they're 26 years old.\nWe've seen an expansion of Pell grants that are helping young people go to college. High school graduation rates the highest they've ever been. College enrollment are the highest that they have been.\nWe have doubled the production of clean energy. We have actually been able to slow carbon emissions faster than any other nation on Earth, even as we were growing rapidly. We have been able to make sure Iran doesn't have a nuclear weapon. We've been able to get bin Laden. We've been able to pull our troops back home so that they can be with their families.\nBy almost every measure, we can say and prove that America is better off than when I got started. But all that progress is at risk because if my successor does not continue on this progress—if my successor is interested in reversing the gains we've made that have driven the uninsured rate to the lowest in history; if my successor reverses the kinds of tax policies and jobs policies that resulted in the largest jump in income and the biggest drop in poverty that's been recorded in a couple of generations last year; if my successor doesn't believe in climate change and isn't worried about the oceans rising; if my successor does not believe in an inclusive America where everybody who works hard and is willing to do their part has a place; if we have a successor who divides us rather than brings us together, then a lot of these gains could slip away.\nAnd that is why I have been working so hard and Michelle has been working so hard to make sure that probably as qualified a person as has ever run for this office is the 45th President of the United States, Hillary Clinton.\nNow the good news is that at the moment, the polls show that Hillary is enjoying a lead. But I want to make sure that everybody understands: This has been an extraordinarily volatile race and a volatile time, and so we can't take anything for granted. Voting has already begun. There are a lot of States like Ohio and Florida that are way too close to call. We're still 2 weeks away and that means that we have to roll up our sleeves and work as hard as we can to make sure that people actually turn out to vote.\nThe majority of the American people believe in a higher minimum wage. The majority of the American people believe that we should do something about climate change. The majority of the American people want to invest in every child so they get a great education. But not everybody votes. And we don't always have working majorities in Congress, and we don't always turn out the kind of votes that result in the policies that we want. But this is one of those moments where we can't afford to sit back and just assume that everything is going to work itself out. The stakes are just too high.\nAnd one of the reasons that I'm so proud of Hillary is that she doesn't take anything for granted. She is somebody who works hard every single day. And it's not always flashy. It's not always fully appreciated. She is somebody who does her homework and knows her policy and grinds it out, and if she's knocked down, she gets back up. And I'm here to tell you, because if you haven't been in that Oval Office and sat in that chair, you don't know what it's like. Those qualities of persistence and a dogged passion for doing the right thing and working hard on behalf of working families all across the country, that's what counts. That's the kind of President you want.\nYou don't want a President who's spending time tweeting all the time. [Laughter] You want a President who is serious about keeping America safe and expanding prosperity for all people. And I've seen Hillary work. She's been in the room. She was there when we made the decision to go after bin Laden, even though we weren't absolutely certain and there were huge risks involved in doing it. She has traveled to over a hundred countries and is well regarded and well respected all around the world.\nShe knows that the decisions that we make are not abstract and you don't just poll to see how it's going to turn out, because it's going to have an impact on a veteran or a soldier or some young person who's trying to go to college for the first time, or some young person who was brought here as an immigrant at the age of 2 or 3 or 4 and are American by every standard except for a piece of paper. And she knows that that young person wants to contribute to this country as well, and we've got to make sure that we give him a chance. She understands that.\nSo she is eminently qualified, really well prepared, has the temperament, has the work ethic, has the policy chops to be an outstanding President. And then there's the other guy. [Laughter]\nAnd I'm not going to belabor why this other guy is not fit to hold this office, because every time he talks—[laughter]—you get more proof that that's not the guy that you want as President of the United States. And I will tell you, the—some of you may be aware of the fact that, like, Michelle does not really love politics. [Laughter] She's—this was not her first choice to—for me. She would have preferred a quieter life, a little bit more out of the limelight. She thought I'd do okay so she said, all right, go ahead. [Laughter] But the passion that she's brought to campaigning this time speaks to the degree that this is—this election is different. The choice is different, and I talked about this at the convention.\nWe always have differences between Democrats and Republicans, and that's a good thing. I am not somebody who believes that any single party has a monopoly on wisdom. Democrats have their blind spots, and we want a healthy two-party system where serious folks enter into a debate around how do we make sure that we're growing the economy. How do we make sure that there are good jobs? How do we make sure that our young people are prepared for a competitive 21st-century economy? How do we make sure that we keep this country safe and don't overextend ourselves, but are vigilant in dealing with things like terrorism? Those are legitimate things to debate.\nAnd in the two campaigns that I had, the first against John McCain and the second against Mitt Romney, I did not agree with them on a whole bunch of things. And I was pretty confident that the policies that I was offering the American people were more likely to help the average American be safe and be prosperous and certainly were more likely to help future generations. But I always felt as if John McCain and Mitt Romney were basically honorable people. I always thought that—[applause]—I always felt as if push comes to shove, they would do the right thing if they ended up occupying the position of President. I didn't—I wasn't concerned about the Republic if they had won.\nI—and so part of the reason Michelle is working the way she is, is because she understands, as I understand, that some more fundamental values are at stake in this election. It has to do with our basic standards of decency. How do we treat people? Do we treat people who are of a different faith as part of the fabric of America, or do we label them as something foreign, not a \"real American,\" and thereby subject to different standards when it comes to how our laws apply? Do we think of women as equal and full citizens, capable of doing anything, or do we think of them as objects of either scorn or lust or our own satisfactions?\nDo we think of the Constitution as something fundamental that all of us have an obligation to try to uphold, or do we think that it's just something that we can pick and choose from at our convenience depending on what's expedient? Do we think that Government is something serious, that we have an obligation to make sure that, to the best of our abilities, we leave the country a little bit better off than how we found it? Or do we think that it's an infomercial or a reality TV show—[laughter]—and we can say anything or do anything without any fidelity to the truth whatsoever, just make stuff up? So that at a certain point, everything is contested; there's no solid ground because you can just say anything and do anything. And my conclusion, Michelle's conclusion is, is that we can't have that in the Oval Office. Because what is true is, is that our kids watch us. I said when I ran for President in 2008, I was not a perfect man, and I would not be a perfect President, but I took seriously the fact that in this job, our kids are paying attention. The entire world is paying attention. And it's important to try to uphold those basic standards even though you know occasionally you're going to make a mistake; even though you know that even when you get it right, you're not going to get necessarily a hundred percent of what you want. It is important to understand the responsibility of this office. And I'm—I don't think I'm alone in thinking that Donald Trump doesn't believe that and he doesn't care about it.\nAmerica is great. America can survive just about anything. But what America cannot have for any prolonged period of time is to have the person who is the only elected official elected by all the people of the United States, and who speaks on behalf of this Nation in world affairs, as a fundamentally unserious person and somebody whose standards of ethics and tolerance and how they treat other people is corrosive. We can't have that.\nAnd that's why this is so important. That's why we've got to work as hard as we can, not just to make sure that Hillary wins, but to make sure she wins big. To send a clear message about who we are as a people. To send a clear message about what America stands for. That is why everybody here has got to work as hard as they can over these next 2 weeks. We want to win big! We want to win big! We don't just want to eke it out, particularly when the other guy is already starting to gripe about how the game is rigged. [Laughter] Come on.\nI was saying the other day, I—those of you who have been involved in sports as you were growing up, or actually, even if you're just playing in the playground when you're like 5 or 6 years old—[laughter]—you always met those—you know there was always the kid who, like, if they weren't winning, they'd be all like starting to have a tantrum and start whining and complaining about this isn't fair. [Laughter] Well, no, you just got beat—[laughter]—that's all. And so we don't want there to be any kind of confusion—[laughter]—because that, too, is corrosive of our democracy.\nOur democracy depends on consent. It's reliant on the good graces of both parties saying, once an election is over then we come together as a country. And once again, it appears that Hillary's opponent is not prepared to play by those same rules. So we've got a lot of work to do.\nNow, I just want to touch on the fact that it's not enough just to elect Hillary Clinton as President. If you look at all the legislative gains, with a few exceptions, that I've accomplished during my 8 years as President, 80 percent of them, 85 percent of them occurred in the first 2 years when we had a Democratic Congress. And that doesn't mean that we were not constantly reaching out to Republicans. I still remember the first couple weeks I was in office, where we knew we had to take bold significant steps to get the economy back on track, and driving up to meet with the House Republican caucus to work with them to shape a recovery package, and hearing that before I had even gotten to the Capitol, John Boehner had released a news release saying, \"We're not going to vote for it,\" before they had even sat down with us.\nSo we reached out. For the most part what we got in return was obstruction, and so we just went ahead and did what we needed to do to rescue the auto industry; to make sure that the economy started growing jobs again instead of shedding them; to make sure that in a country as wealthy as ours, everybody had the opportunity to get basic health care; to make sure that our young people were able to afford a college education.\nWe made extraordinary gains because we had a majority, despite a stated strategy by Mitch McConnell, the head of the Senate, that their most important goal was simply to defeat me in the next election. This is right after I had been elected. [Laughter] I mean, there wasn't even like a—sort of a, I don't know, 6-month pause where we said, \"We'll try to govern for a while.\"\nAnd then, even though we maintained our majority in the Senate, the House went Republican. And from that point forward, what we saw consistently was gridlock, obstruction, \"no,\" threats to shut down the Government in order to defund Planned Parenthood, a willingness to potentially risk the full faith and credit of the United States Government unless they were going to get their way on slashing Medicaid and Medicare and other programs that people rely on. And that's how it's been ever since.\nOver the last 2 years, the Senate has also been in the hands of the majority, and I was actually anticipating that I was going to be using my veto pen a lot. I figured, well, you know, House Republicans, Senate Republicans, they're going to get together, they're going to pass these laws I don't like. I'm going to—I was getting my arm exercise. [Laughter] And, turns out they can't even pass their own stuff. [Laughter] I haven't even been able to use my veto pen. They are not organized enough to get their own priorities passed through Congress. It's Keystone Cops up there. [Laughter]\nAnd the reason this is important is because now that they are beginning to suspect that their nominee may not end up winning and becoming President of the United States, the primary argument that the Republican Party is making—and they are pouring millions of dollars, tens of millions of dollars, maybe more into all the battleground States and States all across the country—the main argument that the Republicans are making is, you need to elect us as quote, unquote, \"a check\" on Hillary Clinton. A check.\nAnd I just want to translate that for you. A check means that we will continue in an unprecedented fashion to block the appointment of perhaps the most qualified jurist ever to be nominated to the Supreme Court, Merrick Garland. A check means the possibility of another Government shutdown unless we get some crazy riders that are attached to the budget that have nothing to do with the budget, but have to do with the particular social agenda of the Freedom Caucus, so called. A check means further efforts to block just basic progress on us trying to reduce our carbon emissions and deal with climate change because the official position of the Republican Party is to deny that the planet is getting warmer, despite what 99 percent of scientists all around the world say.\nI was in Florida last week, and you had Marco Rubio down there who, in a debate said, \"I really don't buy all this stuff,\" and there are—there's like 2 feet of water—[laughter]—on a sunny day in streets in the middle of cities in South Florida, coming up through the ground. [Laughter]\nSo a check means no to raising the minimum wage. A check means no to equal pay for equal work legislation. A check means that we're not going to invest in early childhood education. A check means that we're not going to get serious about dealing with all the major issues that the American people desperately want to see dealt with.\nAnd so I—it is really important that we push back and defeat this argument that somehow the duly elected President of the United States should simply be blocked from doing anything by the opposition party. They're not making an argument that we want to work with her to get things done. They are saying, we are going to say no to everything. That's what they mean by a check.\nAnd the reason that they want to approach it this way and—is that we've become so cynical about Washington. And so often it's portrayed as this equivalent problem of Democrats and Republicans just not getting along, that our attitude ends up being, \"Well, you know what, if we can just split the difference; and our attitude is a plague on all their houses, then nothing will get done, but at least there won't be too much damage done.\"\nAnd that's what the Republicans are counting on. They're counting on people thinking that gridlock is the best we can do because that plays to their basic philosophy that Government has no role in helping a kid aspire to something higher. Government has no role in making sure somebody has health care. Government has no role in making sure that we are caring for the environment and for the planet.\nSo they're okay with gridlock, but you know what? We can do so much better than that. The frustration, the anger that we are seeing in our politics is a direct result not of doing too much, but because we don't seem to just get basic stuff done. Congress just shuts down, stuff that used to be self-apparent, stuff that Democrats and Republicans used to agree on—rebuilding our infrastructure. We could cut down the unemployment rate by another percentage point; grow the economy by another percentage point just by rebuilding roads, bridges, airports. Creating a new smart grid for how we distribute power, putting people back to work all across the country, including, by the way, some of the very folks who are so frustrated that it's led them to start voting for Donald Trump.\nWell, if you're frustrated about more jobs and a faster growing economy, you've got to understand how this happened. It happened because the Republican Party wanted to put a check on progress. We've got to vote against that. We've got to push back against that. We've got to make a bold, sustained, serious argument that America can do better than just gridlock; that Democrats have a responsibility to work with Republicans, but Republicans have to want to actually get something done to move this country forward.\nAnd if your only argument is to do nothing and that is the best that America can do, you do not deserve to be serving in Washington as a Congressman or as a Senator, because we've got enough of doing nothing. We need folks who are there ready to roll up their sleeves and do something to actually move this country forward. That's what we're fighting for.\nSo we've got some work to do the last 2 weeks. And I will tell you that it has been obviously the honor and the privilege of my life to serve as your President. But I always remind people of something that Justice Louis Brandeis once said: The most important office in a democracy is the office of citizen. I won't be President in a few months, but I will remain a citizen just like you. And the way this country works is that each of us carry a certain responsibility, a certain duty to make sure that this grand experiment in democracy sustains itself, that it continues.\nThis is not a spectator sport. We have to be involved. And over the next 2 weeks, everybody here is going to have a test about the degree to which we are fulfilling that duty. And if you are not doing every single thing that you can, if you don't think this is the highest priority of concern to your family and your children and your grandchildren, then you haven't been paying attention.\nAnd if all of you fulfill that duty, fulfill that responsibility right alongside me, right alongside Michelle, well, Hillary is going to be all right. And we're going to have a Democratic Congress. And we're going to get some stuff done. And we will be able to say to ourselves that this was a moment in which America chose its best and not worst self.\nThank you very much, everybody. God bless you.", "timestamp": "2016-10-24", "title": "Remarks at a Reception for Democratic Presidential Nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton in La Jolla, California"}

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119561", "text": "Private Residence\nLos Angeles, California\n**Please see below for a correction, marked with an asterisk.\n11:20 A.M. PDT\nMR. EARNEST: I actually do not have anything at the top, so we can go to whatever questions you may be interested in today.\nQ: We saw the numbers from HHS yesterday. Does the President think it's acceptable for people to have a 25 percent increase?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kristen, you've asked the question in a way that I think illustrates a number of challenges that we face.\nThe first is, for the vast majority of people who are purchasing health insurance through the marketplace -- will not see a significant increase in the amount that they pay for their health care. And that's because the vast majority of people who purchase health insurance through the marketplace get tax credits that ensure that health care is affordable.\nThe bottom line: More than seven in ten people who purchase health insurance through the marketplace will pay $75 a month or less. That is a good deal. It's about the cost of a cellphone bill. That's a particularly good deal when you consider what options were available to individuals on the individual market before the Affordable Care Act went into effect.\nIt's also important to remember that the vast majority of Americans get their health insurance through their employer, through Medicare, or through Medicaid. And since the Affordable Care Act went into effect, those individuals who get their health insurance through their employer have seen the growth in health care costs so limited that they've actually saved $3,600 since the law went into effect.\nI haven't seen yet anybody quantify exactly what the savings is for employers who are in a position of often sharing the cost of health care for their employees. That is, in many ways, an unseen benefit of the Affordable Care Act, but one that benefits 150 million Americans in a very tangible way.\nNow, as the President discussed in his speech in Florida last week, there are some things to address the individuals who are facing the situation that you've just described. And it will require Republicans doing something that they haven't done in seven years, which is to demonstrate a genuine commitment to talking about health care reform in a way that actually makes it easier for people to get health care and holds down the growth in the cost of health care. For the last seven years, Republicans have been focused on trying to find an effective political argument in health care, and they've struggled to do that. They vowed to make this issue front and center in the context of the President's reelection. It didn't work. And there were some promises that they were going to try to do that in the context of this election too, and I feel confident in saying it's not going to work.\nSo maybe after having seen this strategy, this political strategy fail in two consecutive presidential elections, maybe Republicans will come to the table with some specific ideas, or even just a willingness to work with Democrats on the ideas that they've put forward to address this situation. And the President has laid out what some of those ideas could be.\nIt could be, for example, offering tax credits -- expanded tax credits to young people, to encourage -- to give young people an even greater incentive to sign on through the marketplaces, which would improve the composition of the risk pool in a way that would reduce costs for everybody, or at least limit the growth in costs for everybody. The President has also put forward this idea of allowing those communities, where the choice in health care providers is limited, to consider a public option. That would enhance competition and presumably could improve the kinds of offerings that are available to people in communities that don't have as many choices.\nThose are a couple of common-sense ideas. And even if Republicans don't have any of their own good ideas, just an openness to having a discussion, an honest discussion about these ideas that are common sense, that aren't ideological, that would materially benefit millions of Americans -- that would be a pretty good place to start.\nQ: Josh, can I ask you -- is this sort of a one-time increase with insurers having underpriced their plans but finding out that people who are signing up for the exchanges are sicker than expected, so kind of a one-time course correction? Or is this going to be, with insurers dropping out in a lot of states, the new normal of kind of year over year for the 17 percent of people involved in the exchanges that don't get subsidies, a major increase in their --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Justin, I think that your question illustrates another area of complexity here, which is that there's a wide variety of price impacts all across the country. There are some states where the average cost of the health care -- of a health care plan on the marketplace has gone -- went down. There are some places where it's gone up significantly. And I think that is the function of insurance companies making decisions about the most effective, competitive way to price their offerings.\nWe know there are some things that could be done to tweak the law that would limit that kind of volatility and would limit upward pressure on prices. And I floated a couple of those examples before -- expanded tax credits for young people. Another proposal that the President has discussed, not in a lot of detail, but is the idea of expanding tax credits for those families that are entering the middle class, or this idea of a public option that would enhance competition in some of those markets where there isn't as much competition as we would like.\nSo there are certainly additional changes that we can make moving forward that would limit the risk of the situation that you're describing. But I think the thing that we always go back to, Justin, that's important for the context of this argument, is -- it's actually two things. The first is, one of the benefits -- one of the other benefits of the -- often-overlooked benefits of the Affordable Care Act is imposing more transparency on this process. The only reason we're having this discussion right now about the increase in insurance rates is that the Affordable Care Act requires insurance companies to publicly disclose them. That gives regulators an opportunity to push back on those rates, and regulators in states across the country did have some success in doing that in years past. That's the first thing.\nThe second thing is, it was not at all uncommon for insurance companies to jack up rates before the Affordable Care Act went into effect. They just didn't have to disclose it.\nSo the President did give that speech last week in which he made a long argument about how the American people have benefitted from the Affordable Care Act, how the system that the vast majority of Americans face right now is improved, how it's already saved them money and improved the kind of protections that are available to them, including not being discriminated against because they have a preexisting condition, not being subject to a lifetime cap, not being at risk of getting kicked off your health insurance because you get sick. Those are all benefits that the American people enjoy as a result of the Affordable Care Act.\nBut moving forward, the Affordable Care Act is functionally a reform of the private health insurance system. And so pricing decisions are going to be made by the private sector. There's a role for regulators. Greater transparency is certainly going to put pressure on those insurance companies to be competitive. But ultimately, those decisions made in the future are going to continue to be made by private sector health insurance companies that are competing for business in the marketplaces.\nQ: Can I ask you about the Clinton emails? The latest Podesta email exchange that came out showed that Clinton campaign officials said after the President went on \"60 Minutes\" -- and said that he hadn't previously been aware of Secretary Clinton's use of a private email server -- that they need to \"clean this up.\" So I wanted to ask you, first of all, did the campaign alert the White House that the President either had misspoke or that they were concerned that he had misrepresented that he knew about Secretary Clinton's email use and when? And in retrospect, did he obfuscate, either inadvertently or otherwise, to protect her from the revelation that she had done something that would look bad for her campaign?\nMR. EARNEST: So just so I don't forget it, the last answer to your question is no.\nI do want to go back to the premise of your question, though. I think that the emails -- well, let me also offer my standard comment on these emails, which is that these are stolen emails. These are emails that were stolen from a private citizen, released in the context of a website that has been used as a tool, based on an analysis of the intelligence community, by the Russian government in an effort to undermine our democracy.\nSo I've been reluctant to comment on these kinds of emails in the past in part because I can't verify the integrity of these emails. Moving past that, though, let me try to answer the spirit of your question.\nThe first thing is, I do believe that the emails that were released were in the context not of the \"60 Minutes\" interview, but actually of an interview that the President has done several weeks earlier with CBS. And so I think this was an email with Bill Plante -- or an interview with Bill Plante in early March. And the reason that's important, Julie, is that I had an exchange about the very question you're asking in the first briefing that I did after that interview.\nAnd the President was asked in that interview, by Mr. Plante, whether the President was aware that Secretary Clinton was using an email system outside of the government for official administration business. And the President -- that's a -- I think that was a fair characterization of what he said, not a direct quote. The President's response was that he was not aware of that arrangement in terms of where her server was located, but the President did not suggest that he hadn't traded emails with her. And, in fact, I was asked in that briefing whether or not the President had traded emails with Secretary Clinton, and I said of course he did.\nAnd the point that I made there, and have made a couple of times subsequently, is that the President did trade emails with Secretary Clinton, not a large number of them. Of course, the President had possession of Secretary Clinton's email address, but he did not have any knowledge of where her server was located or what sort of arrangements had been made to store her email.\nIn the same way that I trade emails with reporters in the White House Briefing Room, I'm aware of their email address, but I'm not aware of what arrangements your news organizations undertake to store that email, or even whether you do. I think the President's knowledge of Secretary Clinton's email is the same kind of knowledge that we all have about people that we email with, which is that we know their email address but we don't know what sort of server is being used to support that email system.\nQ: Right. But I guess what the question is, was there concern that he hadn't made that clear in the interview? That it sounded like he was saying that he didn't know she was using a private email, when, of course, if he knew her email address and you know it wasn't @state.gov, you would know that it was a private email. And was that communicated to you either before that briefing -- were you clarified, or in the days leading up to your clarification?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, in the same way that I have observed that the President's email address is not BObama@whitehouse.gov, for sensitive emails, most people, I don't think, assume they know the arrangements of a particular email system based on the email address.\nSo what the President said was an entirely factual response to Mr. Plante's question. And I think it's notable that the answer that I'm providing you today is entirely consistent with what the President said 18 months ago and entirely consistent with what I said. I guess it's more than 18 months ago now -- 20 months ago.\nSo I recognize that some of the President's critics have attempted to construct some type of conspiracy about the communication between the President and the Secretary of State. But they've failed to put forward a conspiracy that withstands any scrutiny, so I guess they're back to recycling thoroughly debunked conspiracies. So even in response to the same charges that were leveled more than a year and a half ago, my response is the same.\nQ: Does the President support the efforts to go after these enlistment bonuses that National Guard members here, particularly in California, are being asked to repay?\nMR. EARNEST: Kevin, I can tell you that the President has only recently become aware of this situation. He is -- his first priority is making sure that our men and women in uniform, who have signed up to fight for our safety overseas, are treated fairly when they come home. When we make a promise to our men and women in the military, we need to keep it.\nNow, I say all of that knowing that there is a process that the Department of the Defense has in place to review concerns that are raised by servicemembers. And the President has communicated to the Department of Defense that they need to ensure that we're treating our servicemembers fairly, even as they conduct that process.\nWhat the Department of Defense has said is that they're prepared to expedite that process. It's the President's expectation that they will follow through on the commitment to expedite that process, and they will make sure that our servicemembers are being treated fairly. There's no reason that that has to be inconsistent with the priority of ensuring that the military is a good steward of taxpayer dollars.\nAnd I know that one of the concerns that's been raised by some servicemembers here in California is that the process of evaluating concerns that they've raised about not being treated fairly is unwieldy. And the President's expectation is that the Department of Defense will follow through on their promise to expedite that process.\nQ: There are some lawmakers talking about waiving these debts entirely. Is that something that the President can get behind?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I will say, first of all, I know that this is something that members of Congress were actually confronted with two years ago and, as with so many other things, failed to engage in the kind of constructive effort that could make things better for the country. But for the President's view, I don't think he's prepared to go that far at this point; that a step like that may not necessarily be necessary in order to ensure that servicemembers are treated fairly. And again, that's the President's instinct in this situation. There's a process that the Department of Defense said that they will expedite. His expectation is that that's exactly what they will do. But even as that process is expedited, it must be focused on having the back of our men and women in uniform who have ours.\nQ: Can you explain what you mean by that when you said it may not be necessary to do that, and still ensure that these servicemembers are being treated fairly?\nMR. EARNEST: The FBI conducted an investigation into this particular situation some time ago, and did uncover some examples of wrongdoing. And there are individuals who have been held accountable for engaging in fraud or otherwise gaming the system in a way that was not sufficiently protective of taxpayer dollars.\nSo the President's view is that it is possible to expedite this process of evaluating concerns that have been raised by some servicemembers who have been asked to repay these bonuses. If you do that expeditiously, and have a process that ensures that our servicemembers are being treated fairly, then a blanket waiver is not necessary. What's necessary is we need to have a process in place that protects our servicemembers. And that's what's the President is interested in.\nQ: When did he send that -- ask them to expedite that? Today? Yesterday?\nMR. EARNEST: The Department of Defense committed -- I know that Secretary Carter announced earlier today that they were expediting this process. And that's consistent with the direction that they received from the President of the United States.\nQ: Today?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have a timeline for when he exactly said that, but the steps that have been announced by the Department of Defense are consistent with the President's expectations and with what's been communicated to the Department of Defense.\nQ: So does the President feel that these servicemembers that were being asked to repay their enlistment bonuses have been treated unfairly thus far?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President's view is that -- well, in some cases, I think it is clear that the process has dragged on for too long, considering the claims of some servicemembers. I think the Department of Defense would acknowledge that too. And that certainly would raise questions about fairness.\nBut each of these cases is unique. But the bottom line is, we have a responsibility, the Commander-in-Chief has a deeply held responsibility that we're going to treat our servicemembers fairly. We're not going to nickel-and-dime them when they get back. We're not going to hold servicemembers responsible, unfairly, for unethical conduct or fraud perpetrated by someone else.\nQ: The President said yesterday the U.S. doesn't know who was responsible for the DDoS attack on Friday. I'm wondering if he was using shorthand to sort of say what you often say, which is that you're not ready to name somebody, but that the investigation is maybe progressing and has identified a leading suspect, or if the U.S. is genuinely sort of confounded by this attack. And if it's the latter, I know it's still early days, but what does that say about sort of our ability to protect kind of essential parts of the Internet?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think my colleagues at DHS and other law enforcement agencies have indicated that they're trying to get greater insight into what exactly happened at the end of last week that effectively disrupted the access that some people in the United States had to some commonly visited websites.\nThe President was just using shorthand in indicating that he didn't have a new assessment to share about who may be responsible for this incident. But I don't have an update in terms of the ongoing investigation. I'll let my colleagues at DHS speak to that.\nQ: I wanted to ask about -- the President has also talked a bit on this trip about the HFC amendment to the Montreal Protocol. Do you guys think that's something that's going to require Senate confirmation? I think a lot of people looking at it think that it will. And if so, do you guys have a legislative strategy for that, or is it something that would be kind of punted to a theoretical Clinton administration?\nMR. EARNEST: There has been an ongoing analysis of the agreement to determine precisely what role Congress may have to play in ensuring that the United States can keep the commitments that were made in the context of that agreement. So I can't speak with any precision about what sort of role may be required for Congress, and the United States Senate in particular.\nBut the President does wholeheartedly believe that the agreement that was reached in Kampala *Kigali has significant consequences for the fight against climate change. In some ways, the impact of this agreement is actually more far-reaching than the Paris agreement that got so much attention at the end of last year.\nSecond, the President believes that it is consistent with our national interest to take these kinds of steps to fight climate change, that we already know that there are some places around the world where the impact of climate change could potentially have a destabilizing impact on the planet. And it's one of our national security interests to try to prevent those kinds of things from happening.\nFinally, the President believes that an agreement like this is actually in the economic interest of the United States; that focusing the world on new technology -- in this case, new technology that can be used to refrigerate food and cool buildings -- is a good thing for U.S. businesses. And the United States is on the frontiers of some of this technology. And by having countries around the world make a commitment to phase down their use of HFCs creates a global market for the kind of technology that's being developed here in the United States. So that means enormous economic opportunity for U.S. companies and the potential for significant job growth in the United States.\nAll of those are good things. All of those explain the leading role that the United States has played in trying to craft and complete these kinds of agreements. The President is quite proud of that accomplishment. It's unclear yet right now exactly what role Congress would have to play in that. I would not anticipate that there would be any sort of congressional action required before the President leaves office, so I wouldn't anticipate the conception and implementation of a congressional plan in the next couple of months. But as our policymakers evaluate the agreement and understand its impact on the United States, particularly whether or not it requires some sort of Senate ratification, that's work that will be ongoing. And if it is, then there will be a -- I guess the point of all of this is there will be a very strong case to make to the Senate about why they should approve this agreement, if in fact their approval is necessary.\nCarol.\nQ: There was an attack that the Islamic State helped carrying out in joining with some Pakistani militants. How concerned are you guys that this is a new area in which the Islamic State is spreading? And do you have any confidence that Pakistanis can get something like this under control?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me start by saying that our thoughts and prayers are with those who were affected by this terribly bloody terrorist attack. There are dozens of families in Pakistan that are grieving the loss of loved ones right now. And it is an indication of the very serious threat that Pakistan and the citizens of Pakistan face from extremists in their country. And that's why the United States will stand with the government of Pakistan and the people of Pakistan as they confront this threat. The security cooperation between the United States and Pakistan is important. It benefits both our countries. And we stand ready to offer our support to the Pakistani government and to the Pakistani security services as they investigate this situation.\nThat investigation is still ongoing. I have not heard a firm conclusion reached about who precisely is responsible. We have seen situations where there are extremist organizations who carry out attacks under the banner of ISIL, even though these are previously -- in some cases, previously existing terrorist organizations that are just trying to score a propaganda victory by claiming that the attack was carried out under the ISIL banner.\nSo there's still some investigation ongoing to determine what sort of role ISIL may have played in this particular incident. But whoever was responsible has carried out the kind of terrorist attack that's worthy of widespread condemnation. And the United States, like I said, stands prepared to assist the Pakistani government and to offer our sincere condolences to the Pakistani people for the loss of life in this incident.\nQ: Josh, Jimmy Kimmel asked the President last night, he said, you look like you're having a really good time. The President didn't quite answer that. Is he having -- is this like the most fun that he's been having as President at this point in the presidency?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think it's hard to offer a superlative in this case. There are other moments in the presidency where the President has been obviously having a good time.\nQ: But as an extended period.\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah, but look -- many of you observed over the summer the President's obvious appetite for getting on the campaign trail and making an argument to the American people about the future direction of the country and about the election of the person who will succeed him in the Oval Office. And for months, he observed a primary campaign that he was reluctant to engage in, but once the general election started, there was some pent-up interest, you might say, in engaging in the debate.\nAnd having an opportunity to travel across the country and address large enthusiastic crowds who are clearly excited to see him out on stump -- it's fun. He gets a lot of energy from that. And he feels good that the argument that he is making to the country is resonating, not just deeply in the Democratic base, but all across the country. That's a very satisfying thing to somebody who has poured their heart and soul into the progress that we've made over the last eight years, and to see a large portion, a majority of the American public respond to his call to support candidates that are interested in building on that progress. It's satisfying.\nAnd the President recognizes that the progress that he has fought for is on the ballot. And that's why he's dedicating so much energy to trying to defend it.\nQ: Does he feel vindicated to see the political movement -- it seems, based on the polls, moving toward people that he wants that? Instead of this year not being a rejection of him or shipped away from him, but people moving toward him?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President is pleased about the current trajectory of the race, but based on what you guys have heard over the last couple of days, it's obvious that he's not taking this for granted. He's going to resist any temptation to be complacent, and that's the reason we're sitting here in California, so he can raise money to make sure that Democrats have the resources necessary to get our message out in the last two weeks of the race.\nYou can expect to see the President on the campaign trail again on Friday, in Florida, in support of not just Secretary Clinton but also the candidate for the United States Senate that he's endorsed, Congressman Murphy. And I think you can -- I know you can expect the President to campaign vigorously over the course of next week as well. And again, all that is a testament to the idea that the President is determined to make sure that people aren't complacent. And the President is pleased about the current trajectory of the race, but the votes have just started being tallied, and he'll be out there making the case for Secretary Clinton and Democrats up and down the ballot until the last vote is cast.\nQ: Quick question. The President mentioned yesterday that he -- or he quipped that he wished he'd been able to use his veto pen a little bit more often. The House is going to vote on the renewal of the Iran Sanctions Act as soon as November. Would the President veto that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the argument the President is making is that Republicans have been in charge of the United States Congress now for almost two years. You have a historically large majority in the House, and you have Republicans in charge of the Senate for the first time in, I guess, it was eight years.\nSo you would expect that, presented with that historic opportunity, that Republicans in Congress would get together and be passing all sorts of conservative-minded bills that the President would be forced to veto. But that's not what Congress has done. Republicans in Congress have not been focused on trying to implement an agenda, or move the country forward, or realize a package of legislation centered on conservative ideals.\nSo the President's desire to use his veto pen is a way for him to express his desire for Republicans in Congress that are actually interested in doing something. And the fact that they haven't, even though they have strong majorities in both houses of Congress, is an illustration of how intellectually lazy congressional Republicans have become. They'd rather make simple-minded, often false arguments -- political arguments -- that undermine or obstruct the President. They're not actually making arguments that advance their conservative agenda.\nWith regard to the Iran Sanctions Act, I know that there has been some reporting on this today. I don't have a veto threat to issue at this point, but I'll say what I've said before, which is simply that the President and the Treasury Department retain significant sanctions authority that already has been used to impose costs on Iran for their flagrant violation of their international obligations when it comes to their missile program.\nThat sanctions authority has been used to impose costs on Iran for their support for terrorism, for their violation of human rights. So this is authority that the United States government retains and has used to deal with a wide range of concerns we have with Iran's behavior.\nSo I won't prejudge at this point about whether or not the President would sign that bill, but I would just make the point that the kind of authority that Congress is saying the executive branch should have to confront Iran is the kind of executive authority that we already have and have already used to confront Iran for their support for terrorism, for their ballistic missile program, and for frequent and repeated violations of basic human rights.\nEND 12:01 P.M.

{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "note": "Remarks as delivered.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119689", "text": "Hello, Broward County!Whoa. It is so great to be back in Florida. There are just 14 days, two weeks from today.\nThe most important election in our lifetimes. I'm so grateful to see all of you and I want to thank the elected officials who are here, Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman-Schult,\nCongressman Alcee Hastings, Congressman Ted Deutch, Commissioner Mark Bogen and others who are here, along with Senator Bill Nelson's wonderful wife, Grace Nelson. So we are glad you are all here with me.\nAnd I got to tell you, I was thrilled to be introduced by the person I hope will be the next senator from the great state of Florida, Congressman Patrick Murphy.You know, I think Patrick is exactly the kind of senator that Florida needs and deserves because he will help us break through gridlock and create more good jobs with rising incomes. And Patrick knows we have to build an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not from the top down.\nI also appreciate the fact that we now are seeing an emerging bipartisan consensus that we need to fix our broken criminal justice system, do you agree? But it's going to take strong and committed leaders, like Patrick Murphy, who are ready to show up and fight hard and work to get this done. And -- and this is important, my friends, unlike his opponent, Patrick Murphy has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.\nI think Florida deserves a senator who's going to fight for comprehensive immigration reform that will keep families together against a deportation force.\nThis is what is so unimaginable, of law enforcement officials to go door to door, house to house, business to business, school to school, rounding up 11 million people. I think that is so wrong, and it is not going to happen in America. So you deserve also a senator who actually believes climate change is real, as opposed to someone who every time he's asked says, well I'm not a scientist. And I always wonder, why don't you talk to a scientist? Like start here at Broward College, you could talk to scientists.\nAnd you deserve a senator who would never say that Social Security and Medicare have, and this is a quote, \"weakened us as a people.\"\nHis solution, Patrick's opponent's solution, is to privatize Medicare.\nAudience: Boo!\nClinton: That is exactly the right response, but don't boo, vote, right?\nAnd you deserve a senator who would never support cutting $360 million from Florida's schools, because Patrick knows every child in Florida deserves a world-class education. So my friends, Patrick Murphy is a smart, tough-minded legislator and an independent voice.\nThat's what we need more of in Washington, people like Patrick who are going to get up every day and go to work for you, a better life for you and your families, instead of blocking progress at every turn, listening to the special interests and powerful forces that really are not interested in what it's going to take for every one of you to get ahead and stay ahead.\nSo please, when you get out and vote, please remember you can send Patrick Murphy to the United States Senate, and you will be glad you did.\nNow, I know there's an overflow crowd outside and I'm so sorry they can't be in, but I'm told that they can hear us and maybe even see us, and I want to thank them for coming as well.\nI got to ask you, did anybody see the last debate?\nWell, the good news -- the good news was, it was the last debate.\nAudience: Happy birthday to you!\nClinton: Well, thank you!\nThank you. Yeah, you know, you're right. That last debate was like an early birthday present, right? But here's what I wanted you to remember. I stood next to Donald Trump for four and a half hours, proving once again I have the stamina to be president and commander- in-chief.\nYou know, I tried as much as I could to talk about all issues that are on your minds that I believe we can work together to improve. And in fact, my wonderful running mate I, Senator Tim Kaine, wrote a book, called \"Stronger Together,\" and we put all of our policies in it because I want you to know what we're going to try to do if we're so fortunate enough to be the next president and vice president.\nAnd I think it's important, because I want you to have confidence that we're going to work every day to implement the plans that we have put forth. And I tried in the debate to draw the contrasts with Donald Trump, who doesn't really have very many plans. You know, I've tried to run a campaign based on issues, he's run a campaign based on insults. And so in the debate, we didn't have a lot to talk about, other than he continued true to form to throw out his insults.\nBut in that last debate, he said something that I found horrifying. Well, he said a lot of things, cut there's one thing in particular that I wanted to point out because no presidential candidate, Republican or Democrat, has ever said this. He refused to say that he would respect the outcome the election.\nI guess we shouldn't be too surprised, this is the same guy who said he thought the Emmys were rigged against him. But this is serious. You know, on January 20th, the first thing a president does is to take an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution, and I have serious doubts about whether Donald Trump even understands what that means.\nIn America, we don't say we're going to keep you in suspense about whether we will respect the outcome of an election. We have free and fair elections and the peaceful transfer of power. That is one thing that makes American great, it makes America who we are.\nAnd we don't impose religious tests at our borders because we are a country that was founded on religious liberty. And we don't punish newspapers or journalists that try to cover the news or are critical of politicians, or threaten to restrict the First Amendment, because our democracy depends on a free press. And we don't incite violence and turn people against each other. We respect the open exchange of ideas that a democracy depends on.\nYou know, I've got to say, I bet some of you or maybe your parents, or your grandpar-ents, came from places where none of that was true, right? There is a reason why America is the greatest and longest lasting democracy the world has ever known, because we believe that no matter what you look like or where your parents were born or who you love, you have the right to be treated equally and fairly in the United States.\nAnd Donald Trump is attacking everything that has set our country apart for 240 years. Now, after spending his entire campaign attacking one group of Americans after another -- immigrants, African Americans, Latinos, women, POWs, Muslims, people with disabilities -- now his final target is democracy itself. So here's what I want you to know, in the four years, we are going to change some things in America, right?\nI do want to get the economy working for everyone, not just those at the top. And we're going to do that, along with other positive changes, but we are not going to change the fundamental values that made America the greatest nation in the history of the world.\nYou know, I think it all started -- I think this all started when George Washington re-fused to become a king. Right? Now, Donald Trump probably would have called him a loser.\nInstead, that was one of the most important decisions any president has ever made. Eight years, it's time to move on. We fought a revolution so that we would not have a king. We would not be subjects, we would be independent citizens. I cherish that idea.\nSo here's the good news. Americans are coming together. At the very moment when Donald Trump is making an unprecedented attack on our democracy, millions of people are registering, voting early and volunteering in this campaign.\nAnd here's something very exciting. We have reached a milestone. More than 200 million Americans are now registered, and that includes 15 million young people, the most ever in history.\nAnd you know what? More than six million people have already voted and more than one million of them are right here in Florida.\nSo I think you only see numbers like this when people are standing up for what they really believe in, and that includes not just Democrats but Republicans and Independents coming together to reject hate and division, and I am so excited about what that means.\nBut the energy we are seeing across Florida and America is not just because of what we are against, it's about what we're for. It really is. It's about fighting for that future where everyone counts, everyone has a place and no one is left out or behind. But I want you to know we still have a lot of work to do. I feel good, but boy, I am not taking anything for granted. I'm going to work as hard as I can between now and the close of the election that's two weeks from today.\nAnd you know, it's so important for Florida. There are so many issues that we need to remind people about. Last time I was here, I campaigned with Al Gore and he said a lot about the climate crisis. And you know why? Because we're seeing the reality of climate change every day in Florida. We are seeing areas in Miami even on sunny days without a drop of rain where the streets are flooding. And the ocean is rising.\nAnd what we've got to do is make sure that this issue -- fighting climate change, creating clean renewable energy jobs -- stays at the top of the priorities, and that's why you need a new senator like Patrick Murphy.\nI have to say, nobody should want to wake up on November 9th and wonder whether there was more you could have done. I hope you will wake up on November 9th proud that you took a stand and voted for an America that belongs to all of us, where we set big goals and we work together to achieve them.\nI got to tell you, I believe America is great because America is good.\nAnd I want to tell you one other thing. I want to say one other thing that's really very important to me. We should honor the men and women in uniform who fight for our country.\nThat's why I was so appalled when Donald Trump tweeted that the new effort underway to push the terrorists out of the key city of Mosul is already, and I quote him, \"a total disaster\" and that our country is, again a quote, \"looking dumb.\" Really? He's declaring defeat before the battle has even started. He's proving once again he is unqualified to be commander in chief of our military.\nHere's another example. He was asked if he would defend our allies. He said well, first he'd want to know if they made any payments to us to defend them. And when asked specifically about Israel, he said, and I quote again, he would \"love to be neutral.\"\nNow, we can't have a president who says he's neutral on Monday, pro-Israel on Tuesday, and who knows what on Wednesday, because in his mind, everything is negotiable.\nI have a different view. We stand with our allies. We stand with those who will help us defeat terrorism.\nSo I -- I get pretty excited about what we could to together. And with your help, we're going to make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II -- jobs in infra-structure and advanced manufacturing, and clean renewable energy, and small busi-nesses. I want us to make America the clean energy super power of the 21st century.\nWe can create millions of jobs and protect our planet at the same time. And I've got to say no state, no state should care more about this issue than Florida. Right? And you know, I'll tell you something that it's kind of sad, to be honest with you. I've traveled all over the country. And in New Jersey and Massachusetts, they have more solar power than the Sunshine State.\nWhy? Well, because you have a governor and a legislature who, like your current senator, doesn't want to believe the science of climate change; doesn't see the opportunity that Florida has to be literally the global leader in clean energy.\nAnd so I want to deploy a half-billion more solar panels by the end of my first term, and enough clean energy to power every home in America within 10 years.\nAnd we're also going to strengthen education at every level, starting with universal pre-K, and working -- working with our teachers to make sure every child has a good school with good teachers in every zip code. And here's what I want all the students to hear, we're going to make college more affordable for everyone.\nYou know, after our primary, which was hard-fought, and I was proud of the primary we ran because it was about issues. Senator Sanders and I got together, came up with a plan to make public colleges and universities tuition-free for any families making less than $125,000 a year.\nThat's the vast majority of families. And if you're over that, we're going to make it debt-free. So pay what you can afford. But I don't want to see young people and their families going into debt. I view this as an investment. And that's why we're going to make it easier for you to afford to pay back your college debt -- pay it down and pay it off.\nAnd I also want more pathways to good jobs that don't require a four-year college de-gree. Let's return technical education to high schools. Let's do more with our community colleges. Let's have more apprenticeship programs so that everybody has a chance at a good job.\nAnd you know, in addition -- in addition to making the economy grow and making sure people are ready with the skills to do these jobs, I want to make it fairer. That's why I want to raise the national minimum wage. If you work full-time, you shouldn't still be in poverty. And don't you think it is finally maybe past time to guarantee equal pay for women's work?\nAnd, you know, I always tell crowds, this is not a women's issue. It's a family issue. If you have a wife, a mother, a sister or a daughter working, it's your issue. And that's why we have got to get this fixed once and for all.\nAnd let's make childcare affordable. And let's have more profit sharing. And let's do the kinds of things that will lift everybody up. Now, you know, when I talk about raising equal pay for women as one of my primary issues, you know, Donald Trump or somebody always says, well, there she goes playing the woman card. And I've got to tell you, I don't believe that's what it is. I think we're paying -- playing the smart card.\nBecause we want everybody's incomes to go up. That's how we're going to get this economy really moving forward, creating new jobs. And so if that's playing the woman card, you know what we say, deal me in.\nI've also said I will pledge not to do anything that would raise taxes on people making less than $250,000 a year, because we don't need to do that. We can go where the money is, the millionaires and the billionaires, the corporations, to make them pay their fair share to support the kind of growth that we need in our economy.\nWe're going to close the loopholes and make sure no multi- millionaire can get away with paying a lower rate than a nurse or a police officer or a teacher.\nNow remember when we learned in one of the debates that Donald Trump hadn't paid any federal taxes?\nFor about 20 years is the best guess we've got, and his excuse, I love his excuse, his excuse was well, he lost $1 billion in a year.\nI've been really pondering this. How does anybody lose $1 billion in a year, especially when you're running casinos? Think about it. Has anybody here ever been to a casino?\nAudience: Yes!\nClinton: Well, you know, usually they say the house wins, so Donald Trump said it was smart for him to avoid paying taxes. Well, if losing $1 billion is smart, I think that's kind of upside down and backwards. I think people should be working hard to make their incomes, to support their families, and that's what we're going to do because we don't want the kind of values that Donald Trump used in running his business to be in our government.\nHe stiffs -- he stiffs small businesses. My dad was a small business owner. Donald Trump has refused to pay all kinds of folks, workers, small businesses installing drapes or marble or glass, or where he bought pianos, he didn't pay them. He just doesn't pay them and he gets away with it because he turns and he says to these small businesses well, go ahead and sue me.\nWell, my dad, because he was a small business man, I know he could never have afforded that, so I'm just glad he never got a contract from Donald Trump, because our family would have been hurt by that.\nSo here's the bottom line and here's what I need you to do. We have got to get everybody you know to turn out and vote, and you have early voting now and it's going to be much easier for some of you to vote early. And if you believe in any of the issues that we have talked about in this campaign, if you believe that women and girls should be treated with respect, if you believe that marriage equality should be protected.\nIf you believe -- if believe in science and believe we should take action, if you believe America belongs to everybody willing to work for it and we should stand up against any kind of negative tax, then I hope you will come out and vote because it's going to be a close election. Pay no attention to the polls. Don't get -- don't get complacent, because we've got to turn people out.\nSo I'm asking you to vote for me, I'm asking you to send Patrick Murphy to the Senate, I'm asking you most importantly to vote for yourselves, because really, that's what is at stake. So early voting began here in south Florida yesterday. It goes through Sunday, November 6th. You can go to your early voting site in your county between 7 AM and 7 PM. In fact, you can go across the street right now to the North Regional Library and cast your ballot today.\nAnd we have volunteers and staff ready to escort you, so hey, go ahead and vote now. And you can go to iwillvote.com to confirm your polling place and make sure you have a plan to vote. But don't stop there. If you will join us in these next two weeks, every phone call you make, every door you knock on will make a difference. So please, go to HillaryClinton.com, sign up to volunteer, take out your phone, text JOIN to 47246, and get involved, because the bigger the turnout, the bigger statement we will make about the kind of country we are and the future we want to build together.\nNow, let me just end by saying that people ask me all the time, you know, what moti-vates you, how do you do this day after day? And you know, look, I love this country, and I feel blessed. I feel blessed, and I want everybody to have the same chance to go after your part of the American Dream, and I think the American Dream is big enough for everybody.\nI think a lot about my two grandchildren, because obviously, I would do anything to help them, but it's not just them. I want to help everybody's children and grandchildren, because the kind of country we will have when they become adults will be affected by the decisions we make now on education, on healthcare, on ending the epidemic of gun violence, on getting the cost of prescription drugs down, on preserving and protecting Social Security and Medicare, doing what we must to make sure we're passing on a country that provides the same level of opportunity to all who come after us.\nSo please join me. This is bigger than me, it's bigger than any of us. It's even bigger than Donald Trump, if you can believe it.\nThis is a crossroads election that's going to determine so much about what kind of country we have in the decades ahead. I want to wake up in the White House with your help, making it my mission to do everything I can to give every person, and particularly every child, the chance to live up to his or her God-given potential.\nIf you will stand with me, if you will work with me over the next two weeks, let's go out and build the kind of future we want for ourselves, for our kids, and let's prove once and for all that love trumps hate.\nThank you all very much.", "timestamp": "2016-10-25", "title": "Remarks at Broward College's North Campus in Coconut Creek, Florida"}

The U.S. Census Bureau recently reported that in 2015, the typical household saw its income grow by 5.2 percent (about $2,800), the largest one-year increase on record.\nAt the same time, the President has made clear that there is still more work to do to reverse longer-run patterns of stagnant wage growth and rising income inequality. Over the past several decades, only the highest earners have seen steady wage gains; for most workers, wage growth has been sluggish and has failed to keep pace with gains in productivity. Over the same period, the share of national income going to labor has also fallen, and labor income itself has become divided increasingly unevenly.\nTo ensure that workers share more fully in the gains they help create, the White House is announcing today new steps in response to the President's April 2016 Executive Order calling for actions that enhance competition to benefit consumers, workers, and entrepreneurs.\n* Issue Brief on How Monopsony Power Impacts Wages and Employment. The Council of Economic Advisers is releasing a new issue brief that reviews evidence that firms may have wage-setting power in a broad range of areas, explains how anticompetitive forces can lead to a redistribution of revenues from workers to companies, and reviews the policy implications of this analysis.\n* Non-Compete Agreements: Call-to-Action to States, Largest-Ever Data Collection, and State-by-State Policy Report. Non-compete agreements narrow the employment options for an estimated one in five workers in the United States. As the  White House and  Treasury reported earlier this year, there is substantial evidence of overuse and misuse of these clauses. Today, the Administration put out a call to action and set of best practices for state policymakers to enact reforms to reduce the prevalence of non-compete agreements that are hurting workers and regional economies. To contextualize these best practices, the White House is releasing a state-by-state report on key dimensions of current state non-compete policy. Finally, we are announcing commitments to undertake the largest data collection of its kind to better measure non-compete usage by firms and individuals, alike.\n* Antitrust Guidance and Reporting Hotline for Human Resource Professionals. On Thursday, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) released guidance for HR professionals for how to spot and report collusion among competing employers that may violate the antitrust laws. In the guidance, DOJ announced that going forward it will criminally investigate allegations that employers have agreed amongst themselves on employee compensation or not to solicit or hire one another's employees.\nThese new actions complement the many other steps the Administration has advanced and supported to level the playing field for workers in the job market, including raising the minimum wage, advancing paid leave, supporting collective bargaining, and pushing to reform occupational licensing and land use restrictions.\nTHE CASE FOR ACTION\nIncreasingly, researchers are reporting signs of declining U.S. labor market competition. Economists have begun exploring how these trends connect to rising income inequality. While recent discussions on television set-top boxes and airline tickets have focused on the ability of a small number of firms to set high prices, reduced competition in the labor market results in lower wages and greater earnings inequality, and can also result in lower employment.\nThere are many forces that can limit competition between firms and give employers some power to set wages below the market rate. In some cases, wage-setting power can result from employer actions—like collusion or the use of non-compete agreements—that artificially restrict competition. More generally, any factor that limits workers' choices, restricts their mobility, or creates barriers to changing jobs can weaken workers' bargaining position—which may force them to accept lower compensation or inferior working conditions. The data show that workers today are in many ways less mobile and less likely to switch jobs than they were 20 or 30 years ago.\nOne factor that contributes to trends in labor mobility is the amount of market power that employers can exercise in the labor market. When a small number of employers—or even one employer—wields a large share of market power, they can exercise so-called \"monopsony power.\"\nMonoposonies are the other side of the coin to monopolies. Both reflect a company's ability to affect markets in ways that would be impossible in competitive markets. Monopolies occur when companies have outsized market power, so they can set the price of a good or service at a level higher than if there was fair competition. Monopsonies occur when companies with power in labor markets can set the wages they pay at lower levels and hire fewer workers than if there was strong competition. These lower wages have real consequences for families and the economy more broadly.\nGreater labor market competition can help promote efficiency and employment and ensure that the benefits of economic growth are shared by all. In particular, increased labor market competition means:\n* Higher wages and more hiring. When businesses must compete for workers, they recruit workers and offer higher wages as long as the value of output they produce can support the going wage. Competition thus encourages employers to seek out all productive and efficient hiring opportunities and establishes a close link between wages and productivity. When there is strong competition, firms have no incentive to set wages below the market rate, because if they do, they will lose their workers to competing firms.\n* Greater economic opportunity and fairness for workers. In a competitive labor market, wages are determined by the market, and are not subject to companies' abuse of outsized bargaining power. But when firms have wage-setting power, they have an incentive to pay the lowest wage that workers are willing to accept. As a result, market power not only shifts revenues away from labor, toward managers and inflated profits; it also means that individuals who start out facing greater obstacles and fewer opportunities often end up being paid the least. Competition can help equalize wages across workers with similar skills and ensure a level playing field for all workers.\nADDITIONAL DETAIL ON NEW STEPS BEING ANNOUNCED TODAY\nAddressing Gross Overuse of Non-Compete Agreements\nEarlier this year, the  White House and  Department of Treasury's Office of Economic Policy released reports highlighting the negative impacts of unnecessary non-compete agreements and the actions states are taking to address them.\nAccording to survey data, one in five U.S. workers is bound by a non-compete agreement, including 14 percent of workers making less than $40,000 per year. A considerable proportion of non-compete agreements signed by both low- and high-wage workers come at the expense of wage growth, entrepreneurship, and broader economic growth. Researchers have found that states that strictly enforce non-compete agreements have 10 percent lower average wages for middle-aged workers than states that do not.\nToday, the White House is announcing several new steps to reduce the misuse of non-compete agreements.\nIn addition to encouraging states to take action, the Administration also calls on Congress to pass federal legislation to eliminate non-competes for workers under a certain salary threshold, as in the Mobility and Opportunity for Vulnerable Employees Act (MOVE Act), originally sponsored by Senators Al Franken and Chris Murphy, and in the Limiting the Ability to Demand Detrimental Employment Restrictions Act (LADDER Act). We call on Congress to consider this critical issue and the potential economic consequences of inaction.\n•      Best Practices and Call to Action for States on Non-Compete Agreements. Today, elected officials in Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, New York, and Utah have  signed on to support a call-to-action for state non-compete reform, below:\nWhite House Best Practices for State Non-Compete Reform\nIn order to reduce the misuse of non-compete agreements in states that choose to enforce them, the White House is calling on state policymakers to join in pursuing best-practice policy objectives, including one or more of the following:\n1. Ban non-compete clauses for categories of workers, such as workers under a certain wage threshold; workers in certain occupations that promote public health and safety; workers who are unlikely to possess trade secrets; or those who may suffer undue adverse impacts from non-competes, such as workers laid-off or terminated without cause.\n2. Improve transparency and fairness of non-compete agreements by, for example, disallowing non-competes unless they are proposed before a job offer or significant promotion has been accepted (because an applicant who has accepted an offer and declined other positions may have less bargaining power); providing consideration over and above continued employment for workers who sign non-compete agreements; or encouraging employers to better inform workers about the law in their state and the existence of non-competes in contracts and how they work.\n3. Incentivize employers to write enforceable contracts, and encourage the elimination of unenforceable provisions by, for example, promoting the use of the \"red pencil doctrine,\" which renders contracts with unenforceable provisions void in their entirety.\n•      State-by-State  Explainer of Non-Compete Laws. To educate workers, employers, policymakers and advocates, the White House is issuing a report about existing state laws and some of the key issues related to non-compete agreement reform.\n•      Employer Support to Eliminate Non-Competes for Most or All Employees. Across the country, businesses are eliminating non-compete agreements in favor of more targeted options. They are supporting a shift in non-compete policy because they recognize that fewer, more targeted non-compete agreements will likely increase their pool of available talent and improve innovation.\n•      New Surveys to Examine Prevalence and Impact of Non-Competes, including:\n•      Largest data collection effort ever undertaken on non-compete agreements. PayScale, a company that provides compensation data and software to employers and employees, has committed to collect new data to support the effort to better measure and understand the use of non-compete agreements. This commitment will include anonymously surveying thousands of firms on non-compete practices and asking millions of employees about their non-compete status.\n•      In-depth survey on non-compete use. This upcoming year, researchers Evan Starr, Natarajan Balasubramanian, and Martin Ganco, with the support of the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, plan to field an in-depth survey about non-compete usage and its impact on firm growth, employee mobility, and entrepreneurship.\nCurbing Collusion among Firms to Suppress Wages and Limit Worker Mobility\nIncreased market concentration of firms can also facilitate collusive agreements that allow a small number of employers, who compete over the same workforce, to artificially suppress wages below market rates or agree not to hire one another's employees. Like price fixing in product markets, collusion among employers to reduce wages is illegal in the U.S. and subject to anti-trust laws.\nThese types of agreements eliminate competition in the same irredeemable way as agreements to fix the prices of goods or allocate customers, which have traditionally been criminally investigated and prosecuted as cartel conduct. As FTC Chairwoman, Edith Ramirez puts it, \"Competition is essential to well-functioning markets, and job markets are no exception.\"\nIn 2014, eight Silicon Valley employers settled a civil class action suit for $415 million for allegedly colluding to suppress the wages of programmers and engineers. Specifically, the suit pointed to evidence of \"no-poaching\" arrangements in which the firms agreed not to engage in competitive recruiting of each other's workforces. Other suits, filed in five metropolitan areas across the country, have alleged collusive behavior among hospitals to suppress the wages of nurses. For example, in Detroit, eight hospitals reached settlements that amounted to roughly $90 million in total for alleged collusion to lower wages below market rates.\nThis past week, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced new guidance aimed at combatting collusive behavior in the employment arena. Additionally, in a recent  speech, Acting Assistant Attorney General Renata Hesse highlighted existing DOJ policy that \"a merger that gives a company the power to depress wages or salaries to reduce the prices it pays for inputs is illegal whether or not it also gives that company the power to increase prices downstream.\"\nAntitrust Guidance and Hotline for Human Resources Professionals to Identify and Report Wage Collusion.\n•      Human Resources (HR) professionals are often in the best position to ensure that their companies' hiring practices comply with the law. Last week, the DOJ and the FTC released  guidance for HR professionals for how to spot and report collusion among competing employers that may violate the antitrust laws.\n•      In the guidance, DOJ announced that going forward it will criminally investigate allegations that employers have agreed among themselves on employee compensation or not to solicit or hire one another's employees. In the press release announcing the guidance, Acting Assistant Attorney General Renata Hesse stated: \"HR professionals need to understand that these violations can lead to severe consequences, including criminal prosecution. The newly released joint guidance provides HR professionals with information to prevent violations and report potentially unlawful activity, furthering the Justice Department's commitment to protect workers from harmful conduct that stifles competition.\"\nBuilding on Progress\nToday's actions build on a series of steps the Administration has taken to reduce barriers to fair wages and labor practices, including:\n•      Raising the minimum wage. It has been nearly a decade since Congress last took action to raise the minimum wage, which remains at $7.25 per hour. Since the President started calling for a higher minimum wage in 2013, 18 states and DC have taken action to raise wages, which CEA estimates will benefit over 7 million people by 2017. Over 60 cities and counties have also taken action on their own. These increases help push back against downward pressure on wages.\n•      Expanding paid sick leave. Policies that support minimum benefits are an important complement to minimum wage laws, especially when employers have enhanced power in the labor market. That is why President Obama expanded paid sick leave to federal employees with new children and to federal contract workers to care for themselves, a family member, or another loved one. He continues to call on Congress to pass legislation that guarantees most Americans the chance to earn up to seven days of paid sick leave each year—and urges states, cities and businesses to act where Congress has not.\n•      Supporting worker voice. When workers have a say in their wages and working conditions, they can help ensure that they see a fair share of the economic returns to their labor. In October 2015, the Administration underscored the importance of worker voice by bringing together workers, employers, unions, worker advocates, and others to the White House Summit on Worker Voice.\n•      Reforming occupational licensing requirements and improve portability across states. In 2015, the White House, Treasury Office of Economic Policy, and Department of Labor issued a report on evidence that occupational licensing requirements raise the price of goods and services, restrict employment opportunities, and make it more difficult for workers to take their skills across state lines. Following this report, the Administration has worked with Congress, state legislators, and experts to draft and present a series of best practices to help state and local governments better tailor their occupational licensing laws. To date, legislators in at least 11 states have proposed no fewer than 15 reforms in line with these recommendations, and four state bills have passed so far.\n•      Reforming land use regulations. Over-burdensome land use regulations have made it hard for housing markets to respond to growing demand, jeopardizing housing affordability for working families and limiting GDP growth by stifling labor mobility to the most productive regions. Earlier this year, the White House released a Housing Development Toolkit that highlights the steps communities have taken to modernize their housing strategies and expand options and opportunities for hardworking families.", "timestamp": "2016-10-25", "title": "Fact Sheet: The Obama Administration Announces New Steps to Spur Competition in the Labor Market and Accelerate Wage Growth"}

That deal is grounded in three promises: safe communities, great education, and high-paying jobs.\nMy vision rests on a principle that has defined this campaign: America First.\nEvery African-American citizen in this country is entitled to a government that puts their jobs, wages and security first.\nI'm asking today for the honor of your vote, and the privilege to represent you as your President. Here is the promise I make to you: whether you vote for me or not, I will be your greatest champion. I have no special interest, I take no orders from donors or lobbyists – I work for you, and only you.\nOur campaign is about change, optimism, and the future. I am asking people to break from the bitter failures of the past, and to imagine the amazing possibilities for our future.\nOur opponent represents the rigged system and failed thinking of yesterday. Her campaign offers only the depressing pessimism that says this is as good as it gets, that nothing can ever really change.\nHillary has been there for 30 years and hasn't fixed anything – she's just made it worse.\nAmerican politics is caught in a time loop – we keep electing the same people, who keep making the same mistakes, and who keep offering the same excuses.\nThe fact that our corrupt Washington establishment has tried so hard to stop our movement is just more proof that we represent the kind of change that arrives only once in a lifetime.\nEvery day I'm out on the trail proposing fresh solutions and new thinking. And every day, the same people, getting rich off our broken system, tell us that we can't change and that we can't try anything new.\nI have a message for all the doubters in Washington: America's future belongs to the dreamers, not the cynics.\nAnd it's time to extend that dream to every African-American citizen in this country.\nAfrican-American citizens have sacrificed so much for this nation. They have fought and died in every war since the Revolution, and from the pews and the picket lines they have lifted up the conscience of our country in the long march for Civil Rights.\nYet, too many African-Americans have been left behind.\n45% of African-American children under the age of 6 live in poverty.\n58% of African-American youth are not currently employed.\nAfrican-Americans compromise roughly 13 percent of the population, yet make-up 60% of murder victims under the age of 22.\nIn 2015, violent crime in Charlotte increased by 18 percent – and it's expected to rise 24% in 2016.\nIn the city of Chicago, nearly 3,500 people have been shot since January of this year.\nThe conditions in our inner cities today are unacceptable.\nThe Democrats have run our inner cities for fifty, sixty, seventy years or more. They've run the school boards, the city councils, the mayor's offices, and the congressional seats. Their policies have failed, and they've failed miserably.\nThey've trapped children in failing government schools, and opposed school choice at every turn.\nThe Clintons gave us NAFTA and China's entry into the World Trade Organization, two deals that de-industrialized America, uprooted our industry, and stripped bare towns like Detroit and Baltimore and the inner cities of North Carolina. This state has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since Bill and Hillary's NAFTA, decimating the African-American middle class.\nDemocratic policies have also given rise to crippling crime and violence.\nThen there is the issue of taxation and regulation. Massive taxes, massive regulation of small business, and radical restrictions on American energy, have driven jobs and opportunities out of our inner cities. Hillary wants to raise taxes on successful small businesses as high as 45 percent – which will only drive more jobs out of your community, and into other countries.\nOne of the greatest betrayals has been the issue of immigration. Illegal immigration violates the civil rights of African-Americans. No group has been more economically-harmed by decades of illegal immigration than low-income African-American workers. Hillary's pledge to enact \"open borders,\" – made in secret to a foreign bank – would destroy the African-American middle class.\nAt the center of my revitalization plan is the issue of trade. Massive, chronic trade deficits have emptied out our jobs. Just look at what has happened to Baltimore, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, and right here in North Carolina. It's the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.\nIf I'm President, and the executives at Ford Motor Company announce they are moving their plants and jobs to Mexico, I will pick up the phone and make a simple call. I will tell those executives that if they move their factories to Mexico, I will put a 35% tax on their product before they ship it back into the United States. We won't let your jobs be stolen from you anymore. When we stop the offshoring to low-wage countries, we raise wages at home – meaning rent and bills become instantly more affordable.\nAt the same time, my plan to lower the business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent will bring thousands of new companies onto our shores. It also includes a massive middle class tax cut, tax-free childcare savings accounts, and childcare tax deductions and credits.\nI will also propose tax holidays for inner-city investment, and new tax incentives to get foreign companies to relocate in blighted American neighborhoods. I will further empower cities and states to seek a federal disaster designation for blighted communities in order to initiate the rebuilding of vital infrastructure, the demolition of abandoned properties, and the increased presence of law enforcement.\nI will also pursue financial reforms to make it easier for young African-Americans to get credit to pursue their dreams in business and create jobs in their communities. Dodd-Frank has been a disaster, making it harder for small businesses to get the credit they need. The policies of the Clintons brought us the financial recession – through lifting Glass-Steagall, pushing subprime lending, and blocking reforms to Fannie and Freddie. It's time for a 21st century Glass Steagall and, as part of that, a priority on helping African-American businesses get the credit they need.\nWe will also encourage small-business creation by allowing social welfare workers to convert poverty assistance into repayable but forgive-able micro-loans.\nThen there is the issue of public safety. Making our communities safe again will be a priority for the Trump Administration.\nI have heard and have listened to the concerns raised by African-American citizens about our justice system, and I promise that under a Trump Administration the law will be applied fairly, equally and without prejudice. There will be only one set of rules – not a two-tiered system of justice. The best evidence of unequal justice is that Hillary Clinton could violate so many laws, bleach and delete 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena, lie to Congress and the FBI – put our national security at grave risk – and not even face so much as a fine.\nEqual justice also means the same rules for Wall Street. The Obama Administration never held Wall Street accountable.\nWe will also police our streets. I want every poor African-American child to be able to walk down the street in peace. Safety is a civil right. The problem is not the presence of police but the absence of police. I will invest in training and funding both local and federal law enforcement operations to remove the gang members, drug dealers, and criminal cartels from our neighborhoods. The reduction of crime is not merely a goal – but a necessity. We will get it done. The war on police urged on by my rival is reckless, and dangerous, and puts African-American lives at risk. We must work with our police, not against them.\nOn immigration, my policy is simple. I will restore the civil rights of African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and all Americans, by ending illegal immigration. I will reform visa rules to give American workers preference for jobs, and I will suspend reckless refugee admissions from terror-prone regions that cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars. A portion of the money saved by enforcing our laws, and suspending refugees, will be re-invested in our inner cities. It is time to help the American citizens who have become refugees in their own country.\nInfrastructure will be another major goal. My contract calls for $1 trillion dollars in infrastructure investment, of which the inner cities will be a major beneficiary.\nI will also cancel all wasteful climate change spending from Obama-Clinton, including all global warming payments to the United Nations. These steps will save $100 billion over 8 years, and this money will be used to help rebuild the vital infrastructure, including water systems, in America's inner cities.\nSchool choice is at the center of my plan. My proposal redirects education spending to allow every disadvantaged child in America to attend the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice. School choice is the great civil rights issue of our time, and I will be the nation's biggest cheerleader for school choice in all 50 states. I will also appoint a commission to investigate the school to prison pipeline and to shut it down and create a new pathway that leads from a great education to a great job. My plan will also ensure funding for Historical Black Colleges and Universities, more affordable 2 and 4-year college, and support for trade and vocational education.\nFinally, today, my agenda includes the protection of religious liberty, the promotion of family, and support for the African-American church.\nThis is just the beginning. Because I will never, ever take the African-American community for granted. It will be my mission to prove to this country that yesterday does not have to be tomorrow. The cycle of poverty can be broken, and great new things can happen for our people.\nBut to achieve this future, we must reject the failed elites in Washington who've been wrong about virtually everything for decades.\nThe people opposing us promised that passing NAFTA, and opening our markets to China, would bring a new era of prosperity and job creation. Instead, they brought only poverty and heartache.\nThe people opposing us are the same people who've wasted $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East that have produced only more terrorism, more death, and more suffering – imagine if that money had been spent at home.\nMy opponent unleashed ISIS on the world. She tried to build Democracy in Libya, and failed. She tried to build Democracy in Iraq, and failed. She tried regime change in Egypt, and failed. She pressed regime change in Syria, and failed. She tried a Russian Reset that failed. She tried an Asia Pivot that failed. Now, Hillary Clinton wants to confront nuclear-armed Russia with a shooting war in Syria that could lead us into World War III.\nFinally, our opponents passed a healthcare law, embraced by Hillary Clinton, over the furious objections of the American voter. Obamacare is now destroying our healthcare system – premiums are skyrocketing double-digits and are surging by more than 100% in the great state of Arizona. Doctors are quitting, insurers are leaving, and companies are fleeing. Every prediction they made about this law was a lie. If we don't repeal and replace this disastrous law, we will lose our healthcare system forever.\nNow is the time to embrace a New Direction.\nI've been very lucky and have led a great life. Now I want to give back to the country which has been so good to me. I just left a hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington D.C., delivered under budget, and ahead of schedule, creating thousands of jobs, including construction. It will be one of the finest hotels anywhere in the world, and a great symbol for our country. I took two hours to fly into Washington, to cut the ribbon with my children, and then jump on the plane to be here with you. I wanted to be there for my children, who worked so hard on this hotel -- parents must stick with, encourage, and support their children. They did a great job on the hotel, and I told them so. Likewise, the workers did a magnificent job -- without them, it could never have been built so quickly and so beautifully. The rebuilding we did of the Old Post Office is the rebuilding I want to do for our country.\nI want to go into the inner cities, the poor rural communities, and the failing schools, and I want to work on a national plan for revitalization. I'm tired of the excuses from our politicians. I'm tired of being told what can't be done. I'm tired of people asking Americans to defer their dreams to another day, but really another decade.\nEnough waiting. The time is now. There is nothing we can't accomplish. There is no task or project too great. There is no dream outside our reach.\nEverywhere I go in this country, all I see is untapped potential waiting to be set free. But we will never realize that potential if we continue putting our faith in a broken political system that has let us down time and again. We have to choose the more optimistic path – we have to choose to believe not in our politicians, but to believe in ourselves and in our country. If we do that, anything is possible.\nI'm asking America to join me in dreaming big and bold things for our future. Let's close the history books on the failures in Washington, and let's open a new chapter of success and prosperity for everyone.\nI am humbled beyond words to be the nominee for the Party of Abraham Lincoln. And it is my highest and greatest hope that the Republican Party can be the home of the African-American vote once again.\nTogether, we will have a government of, by and for the people.\nAnd we will Make America Great Again For All Americans.", "timestamp": "2016-10-26", "title": "Remarks at McGlohon Theatre at Spirit Square in Charlotte, North Carolina"}

Nice to see you all. I do not have any announcements at the top, so we can go straight to questions. Mr. Freking, do you want to go first?\nQ: Thank you, Josh. Could you say what role the White House played, if any, if Secretary Carter ordering the Pentagon to stop recoupment of these enlistment bonuses that were sought from some National Guard members?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, as you know, the President makes the fair treatment of our servicemembers a top priority, and so do officials at the Department of Defense. And as I alluded to yesterday, the President has been pleased to see in the last 24 hours the Department of Defense make some specific commitments to ensuring that our servicemembers are treated fairly. When a promise is made to our men and women in uniform, we should keep it. It certainly is the view of the President. And we certainly want to avoid a situation where servicemembers are punished because of nefarious or fraudulent behavior by someone else.\nSo we need to make sure that the process is fair. And I noted yesterday that a long, delayed completion of a complicated process could prevent people from being treated fairly. So the commitments that the Department of Defense has made are to, first and foremost, suspend ongoing collection activities. It may take a few days for that to take effect given the complicated nature of the payroll system at the Department of Defense. But they're going to suspend those collection efforts and implement a more streamlined and efficient process for evaluating the appeals that have been made by the thousands of California National Guardsmen and women who were affected by this particular situation.\nSo we certainly welcome this response from the Department of Defense, and it will be important for them to follow through in taking these steps to ensure the men and women of the California National Guard know that the Commander-in-Chief has their back.\nQ: And just going one step further on that, some people have been making payments. And according to the LA Times story, there has been some hardship from some of servicemembers who have been doing so. Is the White House or the Defense Department considering some way to maybe reimburse some of these servicemembers, or to see if they're made whole again?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, the focus here, at least from the perspective of the Commander-in-Chief, is that we're going to make sure that everybody gets treated fairly, including people who may have had legitimate claims to keep their bonus but have already tried to do the right thing by repaying it, or at least follow the instructions that they* had received to repay it. So I'd refer you to the Department of Defense for how exactly those situations will be handled, but the President is mindful that there are some National Guardsmen who find themselves in that situation, and the President believes those individuals need to be treated fairly as well.\nTim.\nQ: Josh, is the President confident -- turning to the Philippines -- is the President confidence that joint military exercises will continue? This week we saw an annual meeting to sort of plan out those military exercises. It was cancelled until late November. So is he confident that the exercises will continue, or is this another sort of problem that has to be overcome?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, for the logistical details of planning a large military exercise, I'd refer you to my colleagues at Pacific Command, at the Department of Defense. What I can tell you is that we have received no formal communication from the government in the Philippines expressing a desire to make specific changes in the nature of our relationship or our alliance. So the United States remains committed to the pursuit of shared objectives. And the pursuit of those objectives has benefitted the people of the Philippines, and it is indicative of the seven-decade-long alliance between our two countries. And we have received no formal notification from the Filipino government, despite the rhetoric of some senior officials there indicating that they're prepared to change it.\nQ: So your understanding of why this week's meeting was cancelled?\nMR. EARNEST: I'd refer you to the Department of Defense. To be honest with you, I had no knowledge of the meeting, so you should check with them.\nQ: And Donald Trump, he's at the hotel down the street today.\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah, not too far away. Not too far away.\nQ: And yesterday, he was --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, in some ways it's a really long way away. (Laughter.) Depending on how you look at it.\nQ: Yesterday, he was saying that Secretary Clinton's policy in Syria could lead to World War III because Russia is involved and it's a nuclear power. What do you make of that comment?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think it's difficult to discern precisely what policy objective the Republican nominee is advocating for when it comes to the situation in Syria. There are times where he's advocated indiscriminate bombing of that country. There are other times where he's chided his opponent for being too tough on Russia, that we know is targeting civilians in Syria to try to achieve their own political objectives in that country. We also know that Russia has been engaged in an effort to shore up the Assad regime in a way that makes it more difficult for us to resolve the political situation inside of Syria that we know is critical to ending the violence and chaos.\nSo it's difficult to discern exactly what he's advocating for in the context of an interview that your news organization did with him to try to elicit greater clarity about that. And when you look at the totality of his remarks -- even over the last several months -- it's difficult to figure out if he knows what he's talking about. And if he does, what policy he would vow to pursue as President.\nQ: Is it dangerous to say things like World War III in that context?\nMR. EARNEST: Well again, the President on a number of occasions has expressed some significant concerns about the rhetoric that's being used by the Republican nominee. But I'll leave it to all of you to try to figure out what exactly that means for what kind of policy he would pursue if he were President.\nMichelle.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. With the numbers that we saw yesterday coming out on Obamacare, to what extent did the administration see that coming? Are the numbers of the premium increases, on average, bigger than you guys expected?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think there are a couple of things that are important for people to understand about these premium increases. And we have seen -- and what these numbers do show is that there are a number of communities across the country that will see a significant increase in the premiums charged by insurance companies that are selling plans in the marketplace.\nWhat's important for people to understand about this is that most people don't get their health care through the marketplace. The vast majority of Americans get their health care, their health insurance from their employer, from Medicaid, or from Medicare. And for the large number of Americans -- about 150 million Americans who get their health insurance through their employer, we've actually seen that the growth in premium increase has been remarkably low. In fact, when you total up the savings over the last several years from the reduction in the growth in those costs, the typical family in the United States has actually saved $3,600. That's a substantial savings -- and doesn't factor in the kind of savings that are enjoyed by the businesses that are also paying for their employees to get access to health insurance.\nSo when it comes to the marketplace itself, it's also important to understand that the vast majority of people who are purchasing health insurance through the marketplace benefit from tax credits that make that health insurance more affordable.\nSo even the wide reports that we're seeing of some premium increases won't have an impact on the majority of people who are signing up in the marketplace because they get tax credits that offset that increase in cost. But the President is concerned that there are some middle-class families who are purchasing health insurance at the marketplace and don't get the substantial benefit associated with a tax credit. And the President believes that's a problem that we need to address. Even if it's one that affects a relatively small percentage of Americans, we're still talking about a number of people that the President is hopeful that we can cut health care costs for.\nNow, it's important to remember that even people in that situation benefit from the Affordable Care Act because they have the kinds of options and choices and offerings that were not previously available to them before the Affordable Care Act went into effect. So how do we build on the progress that we've made? And the President has put forward several ideas.\nThe first is, one thing we know we could do is that, if every state expanded Medicaid, that would lower premiums for everybody. And in those states where Medicaid has not been expanded, that's actually put upward pressure on premiums. That's not a good outcome. And so, if we're looking at ways that we can cut health care costs, let's do right by all of our citizens and ensure that we're expanding Medicaid.\nAnother idea that the President has put forward is, let's offer a special tax credit for young adults to give them an even greater incentive to participate in the marketplace. We know that that would have a positive impact on the risk pool and would also put downward pressure on potential price increases.\nSo there are a number of proposals that the President has put forward. The unfortunate situation we find ourselves in is that Republicans would much rather play politics than solve problems. And that is true with the Republican approach to a wide range of issues, but it's -- there's no better example of their approach to play politics and not solve problems than when it comes to the Affordable Care Act. Because we know that Republicans have proposed -- have actually voted more than 50 times to repeal the Affordable Care Act that would, oh, by the way, significantly increase the deficit, strip health care from 20 million Americans who got it because of the Affordable Care Act, or have got it since the Affordable Care Act went into effect, and would have the effect of undermining the kinds of consumer protections that we all enjoy, including those of us who get our health insurance through our employer.\nSo Republicans are just looking for the political benefit of being able to say they opposed the Affordable Care Act, and not actually looking for the kinds of constructive solutions that would reduce costs and expand access to quality, affordable coverage.\nThe most important thing -- and I know this has been a long answer, but it's a complicated issue -- is people should not be dissuaded from considering the options that are available to them on the marketplace. And I think, in many ways, that is our chief concern. The open enrollment period starts a week from today. And if you don't have health insurance right now, or you purchased your health insurance off the marketplace and in the individual market, or even if you last year did purchase health insurance through the marketplace, it's important for you to go back and see what options are available to you this year. There is actually good evidence to indicate that you may be able to purchase a plan at the same -- at a comparable benefit level that costs less than what you paid in 2016.\nSo there are good options available to people out there, and it's important that people are not confused by the headlines and understand the true impact of this law. It doesn't cost anything to shop around. And the early evidence is that the vast majority of people who shop around are going to find a good deal and maybe even save some money.\nQ: That was remarkably thorough. Thank you, Josh. (Laughter.) The question was actually, did you see it coming? I mean, given that the increases have been around 7 percent the past couple of years, and now this jump, did you know this was going to happen given the profile of the enrollee pool?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, this is a reform of the private health insurance market. The decisions that are made about pricing are made by private companies. There is greater transparency into those decisions that is required by the Affordable Care Act. The only reason we're having the discussion we're having right now about the increase in costs is because the Affordable Care Act imposed additional requirements on insurance companies to disclose what those costs are.\nSo I guess the point is, Michelle, the United States government is not responsible for setting those prices. These are prices that are determined by private insurance companies. They're in a regulated market, so we do have some impact to -- and we do have an ability to impact some of those strategies. And there are some constraints that they're operating under. But ultimately those decisions are made by private companies.\nQ: So should I take that as a no?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think you should take it as this is a private enterprise. It's regulated by the federal government. There are constraints that are imposed on the private system in a way that does protect consumers and protects middle-class families and limits the cost -- or limits the increase in prices. But ultimately the prices are set by private companies, and so that certainly is going to limit our ability to dictate an outcome that we'd like to see.\nQ: When you saw some of the strains within the system, some of these bigger insurers pulling out of some states completely, did you feel like this was going to be a year coming where you would see a jump like that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, Michelle, the other thing that's hard about answering this question is that there are some states where the average costs went down.\nQ: True.\nMR. EARNEST: So there's a lot of variety across the country in terms of what the impact has been. It's an indication that there are some states that are doing this the right way. There are some states that have expanded Medicaid; that have invested their own resources in building a marketplace; that have worked effectively with the citizens of their states to recruit people to sign up and ensure the kind of broad, diverse risk pool that benefits everybody in terms of reducing costs.\nSo some states have done this the right way. And there are several useful comparisons about states that have made an honest effort to look out for their constituents and implement this policy to maximize the upside for middle-class families. The growth in health care costs is not nearly as significant -- or health care insurance costs is not nearly as significant as it is in comparable states.\nCalifornia is a good example. Another example that we've seen is actually in Arkansas, that that's a state did work closely with HHS to tailor a Medicaid expansion that has actually proved beneficial for the citizens of their state. It's also proved beneficial for the fiscal situation of the state government. And they've also taken that collaborative approach to expanding Medicaid and applied it to the construction of the marketplaces in that state. And the growth in health care costs in Arkansas is much lower than it is in a state like Oklahoma, with whom they share a significant border, a state that has been hostile to the Affordable Care Act, that has refused to expand Medicaid, that has opposed efforts to ensure the efficient functioning of their marketplace. And in Oklahoma, you're seeing prices get jacked up.\nSo I guess, if anything, Michelle, what we have -- what this does illustrate is that in some states Republican politicians have been reasonably successful in sabotaging the effective implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\nQ: Okay, and just quickly then, so if no changes are made across the board or within individual states, is it safe to say then the following year things could be -- could rise again as significantly, or things could be just as unpredictable?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess when you're talking about the private market, there is always going to be an element of unpredictability. There are some things that we could do if Congress were to take action that would limit the risk of future price increases, or at least would limit the size and risk of future price increases.\nAnd so, again, enhancing incentives that are made available to young adults to get them to sign up, expanding access to tax credits to get more middle-class families more help in reducing their health care costs. The President has also put forward an idea that in those places where there is not as much competition, that we should set up a mechanism where there could be a public option that would give consumers in those locations an additional choice. And that could spur additional private competition that could improve benefits and lower costs. The President believes that these are all ideas that are worth considering.\nYou'll note that none of these ideas are ideologically motivated. These are all very practical solutions that are actually consistent with the kinds of proposals that we've seen Republicans offer up in the past when it comes to health care reform.\nThe idea of offering people tax incentives and tax credits to make their health insurance more affordable is an idea that conservatives have long advocated -- the idea of regulating the private insurance market and subjecting them to -- making them compete in a marketplace that these market forces would have a positive impact on the choices that are available to consumers. Again, these are Republican talking points that I'm using here. And you would expect that there would be some Republicans in Congress that would be open to these ideas. But it's going to require them focusing on actually solving problems and not just playing politics.\nQ: Did far fewer young adults sign up than the administration expected, though? What accounts for that?\nMR. EARNEST: You'd have to check with HHS in terms of their projections. But regardless of how they match up to our projections, Michelle, there certainly is room for more young adults to sign up. And we certainly are going to be engaged in an aggressive effort in the federal government to get the word out and educate young adults about the options that are available to them -- because we know as they sign up, that provides important protections for those young adults and their families. But it also enhances the risk pool in a way that would limit the growth in health care costs that would have a positive impact all across the country.\nSo regardless of what the projections show, there is more that we would like to do in terms of enrolling young adults and making sure they're educated about the options and opportunities that are available to them.\nQ: Thanks a lot.\nMR. EARNEST: Margaret.\nQ: Josh, the President is going to that APEC meeting next month in November. Would he be open to meeting with the President of the Philippines who is also an APEC member?\nMR. EARNEST: At this point, I don't have details about the President's schedule when he's attending the APEC Summit. I don't know how much time his schedule will allow for bilateral meetings on the sidelines -- presumably at least one or two.\nI also don't know at this point whether or not President Duterte has committed to attending the APEC conference. But as we make some progress in putting the President's schedule together for that trip, we'll keep you posted on this.\nQ: So the White House would be open to scheduling such a meeting?\nMR. EARNEST: It's not one I'm prepared to rule out at this point. But we've ruled out previous meetings with President Duterte on short notice. (Laughter.)\nQ: I remember.\nMR. EARNEST: I'll bet you do.\nQ: Along those lines, when we were with the President in Asia in the wake of some fairly insulting comments from President Duterte, when that meeting was called off, the President himself sort of downplayed his own personal level of concern and sort of dismissed it, saying, this is not representative of our relationship with the Philippines. But since then we've seen this string of comments.\nMR. EARNEST: That's true.\nQ: Twice in one week now this threat to end military exercises and push out U.S. troops within two years. Isn't there a growing level of concern?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what is true is that the string of counterproductive rhetoric that you're referring to has injected some unnecessary uncertainty in the relationship between the United States and the Philippines. And what the President said in Laos is certainly true today -- that that rhetoric that we've seen quite a bit of over the last several weeks is not indicative of the strong relationship between the United States and the Philippines. It's not indicative of the seven-decade-long alliance between our two countries. It's not indicative of the deep cultural ties between our two countries, particularly given the sizeable Filipino-American population in this country.\nIt's also no indicative of the kind of support that the United States has offered to the Philippines in the past. In the last couple of years, the United States military has mobilized an aggressive response to assist the Filipino people as they respond -- recover and rebuild in the aftermath of large storms in the Pacific Ocean. That's the nature of the United States' relationship with the Philippines. That's an indication of how beneficial this relationship has been to the citizens of both countries. And we certainly would welcome more rhetoric that is reflective of that relationship, and not rhetoric that only contributes to greater uncertainty about the willingness of the Filipino government to live up to commitments that they've abided by for seven decades.\nQ: So you just see this as rhetoric at this point? You're not taking these threats seriously?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as I mentioned in response to Michelle's question, we haven't received any formal notification or communication from the Filipino government that they're planning to make any changes to our relationship.\nQ: But that meeting is next month, though. That just hasn't happened yet, right?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there's a diplomatic process where, through a formal channel, the Philippines could formally notify the United States of their intent to, like I said, alter the terms of the alliance between our two countries. We've received no formal notification along those lines. So that's why the news that's been made out of the Philippines I would classify as rhetoric at this point. We haven't received any sort of formal notification or communication indicating a policy change.\nBut it does contribute to some uncertainty, and that uncertainty is inconsistent with what has for the last seven decades been a rock-solid alliance that's benefitted people and governments in both countries.\nQ: But given all this uncertainty, I mean, the bigger picture -- President Obama has tried to pivot towards Asia, and the Philippines is a pretty key military alliance within that region. Doesn't this damage the President's own efforts to have this kind of rhetoric and perhaps some follow-through on those threats?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, we haven't seen that follow-through. And I don't think I've been coy about the fact that we'd rather not see this kind of rhetoric from the President of the Philippines. But the United States has made a lot of important progress in strengthening our alliances throughout the Asia Pacific, mobilizing resources that indicate our long-term commitment to that region of the world, and making clear the long-term financial interest, economic interest that the United States has in preserving our ties throughout the region.\nSo the fact that the United States is a Pacific power is something that was in doubt when President Obama took office, and it's not anymore. And that's not just because of the way that we have previously made progress in strengthening our relationship with the Philippines, but it's also a testament to the progress that we've made in rotating an additional detachment of Marines through Australia, at Darwin, for example. The progress that we have made in shoring up, strengthening and investing in our alliances with South Korea and Japan, the deployment of additional military equipment and personnel to that region of the world to ensure that we're mitigating and countering the threat that emanates from North Korea -- all of this is a testament to the progress that we've made in enhancing robust U.S. engagement in the Asia Pacific region.\nCheryl.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Another part of that meeting. You had put out in your statement yesterday that when the President goes to Peru, he's going to meet with leaders of the TPP countries and to talk about that. Do you expect that you'll know at that point whether or not Congress is going to take that up?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I've been doing this job long enough to know that it's foolish to try to predict congressional outcomes, and so I'm going to resist the temptation to do it here. Rest assured that the President will make a strong case that Congress take up and pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership. This is an agreement that was long-negotiated, is an agreement that cuts taxes -- 18,000 taxes that other countries impose on American goods. It is an agreement that would put many Asian countries, some of the fastest-growing Asian countries, economically, in a position of raising their labor standards, raising their environmental standards, and creating an environment that's more fair to U.S. workers and U.S. businesses.\nThat's why the President makes a strong case that this is clearly in the national security, the strategic, and economic interest of the United States, including the small businesses and middle-class workers that are the backbone of our economy. So that's the strong case that the President will make, and it's a case that we expect would resonate with both Democrats and Republicans in Congress. But ultimately they'll have to make their own decision about whether or not they're prepared to take it up; we certainly hope they will.\nQ: Have you had any recent conversations? I know the election has occupied much of Congress --\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah.\nQ: -- but about timing on that?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any updates for you. I mean, obviously this is something that we're thinking through. And we've indicated for some time now that we're prepared to coordinate with the leaders in both parties, and supporters of the TPP in both parties to formulate a strategy about the best path forward. But I don't have anything to tell you about that strategy at this point. But obviously, the election is two weeks away and we'll have more to say about it afterwards.\nRon.\nQ: On the National Guard bonus thing, you said the President's guiding principle is that people should be treated fairly. Nobody has said that any of these individuals did anything wrong. So why does fairness not mean just forgiving these debts?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Ron, there actually was an FBI investigation that did uncover wrongdoing and fraudulent behavior by some of the recruiters.\nQ: But on the part of the individuals, not the recruiters, but on the part of the Guardsmen who received these bonuses.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, you should check with the Department of Defense. There are a number of individuals who, based on some review, were found to have not been eligible for and shouldn't have collected some of the bonuses. So you can talk to them about individual cases. But there is some evidence to indicate that some people shouldn't have received bonuses. And the Department of Defense does have a responsibility to taxpayers to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars. And if there was a payment that was made in error, they have a responsibility to the taxpayers to go and recover that money.\nBut our first priority and the overriding priority should be ensuring that our servicemembers are treated fairly. And it's important that people who -- are not punished unfairly because of the wrongdoing of some other people.\nQ: So would it be the President's expectation that a lot of these individuals would get their money back?\nMR. EARNEST: The President's expectation is that each case would be considered individually, and each person who committed to serving this country is going to make sure that any promises that were made to them are kept and that those individuals are going to be treated fairly.\nQ: And in terms of -- you've said that the DOD is obviously looking into this. But as Commander-in-Chief, has the President -- is the President proposing any kind of fix? The question essentially is, how engaged is the Commander-in-Chief in this particular issue? Or is he just basically saying to the DOD, you take care of it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President has an expectation that people further down the chain of command are going to be executing a strategy that is consistent with his expectations. And that's what we've seen from Secretary Carter in the announcement that he made today. That's what we've seen from Deputy Secretary Bob Work, who has indicated that he's going to take his own personal responsibility for implementing some of the solutions that Secretary Carter discussed today. And the President's expectation is that they're going to do that expeditiously because this is a top priority for him.\nQ: And just one thing on the Obamacare premiums, and I just want to make sure I understand this. You talked about some of the things that are happening. You talked about how these are state-regulated -- it's a private market.\nMR. EARNEST: That's right.\nQ: But the bottom line that people see are these staggering numbers of a premium increase. And I know about tax credits and subsidies and so on and so forth. But the underlying increases that are happening in these private -- by these private companies, is the administration concerned that those numbers are too high? When we see 116 percent increase in Arizona or a 22 percent or 5 percent average increase, is there some concern about that number? Not just about the things that the administration is advocating for or seeing as mitigating factors? Is there a concern about how -- how we're getting to those big increases just on their own?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, Ron, I think because you raised it this way, I think it's important for people to understand that most people who go shopping on the marketplace are going to be able to find a health care plan that they can purchase -- because of tax credits -- for $75 a month or less. So it's important for -- this is complicated. So it is important for people to understand that it is worth their time to go and shop on the marketplace and consider what options are available to them. The vast majority of people who do that are going to find that they qualify for a plan that costs 75 bucks a month or less.\nSo that's the first thing that's important for people to understand. Even in the face of some of the significant price increases in some states, the tax credits that they are eligible for rise along with those prices, which mitigates the increase and does keep health care affordable for a lot of people -- the majority of people, in fact -- who end up purchasing plans.\nQ: We understand that. But again, the price increases are the thing. Is there some concern about that aspect of this very complicated and involved system?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it's also important for people to understand that there are some states where prices this year have gone down. And so it's important for people to sift through the headlines and understand what the actual impact is on them and their family and in the choices that are available to them.\nBut to get to the question that you're asking about the people who do purchase health insurance through the marketplace that don't qualify for tax credits -- and there are some people in that situation who also live in states where they are seeing significant increase in prices -- yes, the President has put forward some specific solutions that would address the circumstances of people who are in that situation and try to prevent it from happening again.\nThat is the proposal that would, for example, expand tax credits for young adults, or to expand eligibility for tax credits among some middle-class families that would address the concern that you're raising.\nQ: No, I understand what -- again, the tax credits, and what's mitigating -- what's being done to help people get affordable health care. The question is about the dynamic of these premiums increasing, the price increasing. Are these insurance companies making too much money? Is that gouging consumers? Do you understand what I mean? Is there some concern about just that aspect of the system that the prices are going up so high? Regardless of what the -- regardless of what resources consumers have to mitigate that, is that aspect of the system a concern to the administration?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me just start out by saying the President's foremost concern is what impact that has on families. And so that's why there's this intense focus on tax credits and making sure that people understand that despite the price increases, that most people who sign up are going to be able to purchase a plan for $75 a month or less; and that we have some ideas to mitigate the impact of those price increases on families that don't qualify for tax credits. But --\nQ: So the insurance companies aren't making too much money then?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, so there are regulations that apply to insurance companies. Again, these are regulations that for the first time apply and constrain health insurance companies because of what's put in place by the Affordable Care Act. The first is, insurance companies have to be transparent and they have to disclose these costs. That kind of transparency does serve to limit the ability of insurance companies to jack up prices. They don't want the bad publicity associated with these significant cost increases. In some cases, insurance companies know this is going to cost them customers.\nThe second thing is there are some rules going back to the Affordable Care Act that are put in place that limit the amount of profit that an insurance company can make. So this is something that we talked about quite a bit very early on, but there's something that's called the 80-20 rule, which is that if -- based on the financial submissions of insurance companies to regulators -- if it's determined that insurance companies paid less than 80 percent of the premiums that they collected to provide health insurance to people, that they had to pay into a fund to make sure that they weren't gouging customers for the premiums that they were charging.\nSo there are efforts to limit the ability of insurance companies to gouge customers by forcing them to be transparent and forcing them to actually spend the money they collect on providing health care to people. And if they don't, then they pay into a fund that ensures that everybody is being treated fairly.\nThe other part of this that's important -- and this is sort of an additional part of the mechanism here -- is there's something that's called rate review. This is not the first time that all of your news organizations are reporting on likely premium prices for 2017. Insurance companies had to make public an initial submission to rate regulators in their states to disclose what premiums were going to cost for the upcoming year and give regulators an opportunity to evaluate those costs and to impose limits on certain increases.\nAnd so it's often the case that the original reporting around likely premium costs for the upcoming year don't actually reflect what people have to pay next year because regulators are able to evaluate the proposal that they have put forward and force insurance companies to reduce costs. That is a process that is in place because of the Affordable Care Act. And it is having a positive impact on prices.\nThere is a reason that since the Affordable Care Act went into effect, studies indicate that the growth in health care costs all across the board are at historic lows. And that's -- we certainly believe -- and scientists, economists, policy makers believe -- that the Affordable Care Act has had a positive impact on the growth in health care costs. And that's been a good thing.\nQ: Just lastly, when you were asked about the Trump hotel, you said something about in some ways it really is a long way away, depending on how you look at it. What did you mean?\nMR. EARNEST: I just mean that on the map that the two places are not that far away, but there's a big difference between standing in the hotel and standing in the White House.\nQ: The map -- or the electoral map? Or you mean the D.C., District map?\nMR. EARNEST: No, no, I mean, if you pull up Google Maps, it's like three blocks away. So -- (laughter) --\nQ: You sure you don't want to say anything else about this, Josh?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I think I've covered it.\nLaura.\nQ: In France, at this moment, there's a very serious discussion on media, information, tabloidization, and politics. Last week, the French Minister of Culture asked people to be careful about what she called the \"Trumpization\" of the information. Do you have any reaction to that? And what's your reaction to the possibility of a Trump TV in this country?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I didn't see the comments from the Culture Minister in France. What I will say is that here in the United States, we've got a longstanding tradition of vigorous political campaigns, particularly when the winner is somebody who will assume to the highest office in the United States. And our expectation is that a vigorous debate is something that makes our democracy even stronger.\nNow, there's a downside, which is that sometimes the rhetoric in the context of a debate gets overheated. Sometimes the rhetoric that's used in the context of the debate doesn't withstand much factual scrutiny. But by and large, the nature of a vigorous debate means -- in fact, it ensures -- that the person who is most effective in conveying to the American people their values and priorities and their agenda are the people who are entrusted for running the country for the next four years. So our system of democracy is certainly not perfect. But it's better than all the alternatives, I think that's -- to paraphrase Winston Churchill, I believe.\nSo I think the bottom line here is that -- and this is something that we've talked about over the course of the last couple of years -- the President believes that a vibrant debate is an indication of a vibrant democracy. And the question is: Are there some things that we can do to make sure that the rhetoric is focused on political differences and doesn't spill over into threats of violence? Are there some things that we can do to make sure that the rhetoric is focused on the facts and not just on an alternate reality? Yeah. There are some things that I think would be good. Or our debate would be better if we can avoid some of those things, and our democracy would benefit from it.\nBut I think, by and large, the American people should draw some confidence from the idea that we can engage in a vigorous debate in this country, and then when the votes are tallied, people can have confidence in the outcome and they can have confidence that the current President, the outgoing President, and the incoming President will work effectively together to ensure a seamless transition, and that the incoming President is given the best possible opportunity to succeed.\nAnd that, you know, this is -- I know that there was this letter that was written by our 41st President of the United States, President Bush, that he left for his successor, President Clinton, in which he ended the letter by saying he was rooting for President Clinton's success. Keep in mind, they had just spent most of the last year campaigning against each other, participating in debates, criticizing each other's plans. At the end of the day, President Bush showed the kind of spirit that makes America the greatest country in the world, which is a commitment, at the very highest level, to put the interests of the country over his own political interest and his own political ambition, and his own belief about which direction the country should go.\nHe was overruled by the voters. And to his credit, it's one of the many reasons that people look upon President George H.W. Bush as not just a great President, but a great patriot, is that he acknowledged, from the very first day of the Clinton presidency, that he was rooting for the success of the American President, even the American President that was in the other party and had run against him, because he knew that if the American President was succeeding, that the country was succeeding. And the country's success was even more important that his own.\nAnd I think that's why there is such enduring respect for his service to the country. There are lots of reasons to be respectful of his service to the country, but certainly that gesture is as good as any of the others.\nQ: But (inaudible) that Donald Trump might launch a Trump TV. It's all over the news and it could be a global TV. It could a populist TV. So do you have some worries about that?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware that the President is losing any sleep over that.\nQ: And what's the White House reaction about, again, the possibility of a Trump TV reaching a global audience?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, last I heard, he had said that it wasn't true. So there are some risks with taking him at his word, but I guess it's all we've got in this case.\nToluse.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. You just talked about rhetoric, and I wanted to point to Vice President Joe Biden's comments a couple of times about wanting to take Trump behind the gym. Trump responded to that yesterday, saying that he'd love that. Is that level of rhetoric, is there any concern that our political rhetoric has sort of devolved into threats of physical violence?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I know that Vice President Biden had an opportunity to discuss this with Chris Matthews from MSNBC yesterday. So I'll largely let his comments speak for themselves. I think what I can contribute to this discussion is simply -- you've heard me say in that past that the whole reason that our political system exists is to find a way to resolve our differences through politics and debate, not through violence. And I know that Vice President Biden shares that assessment. I think that he explained as much yesterday in describing to Chris Matthews his comments.\nQ: Can I ask about Raqqa, as well? I guess there is now a sort of an idea that the battle for Raqqa will begin before Mosul, or while the Mosul offensive is ongoing. Is that something the President is supporting? Is there a specific timeline that he's looking for? And what is your reaction to people like Trump who say that we shouldn't be telegraphing an offensive that's potentially weeks out?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there's a lot there. Let me start by -- you saw that Secretary Carter indicated earlier today that he expected the offensive against Raqqa to begin in a matter of weeks. So for more details on our operational planning, to the extent that the Department of Defense is willing to disclose them, you should direct your questions to them. Obviously, Secretary Carter's comments reflect the discussion that the President has had with his national security team, and reflect the President's conclusions about the strategy moving forward.\nI believe, in the context of those comments, Secretary Carter indicated his confidence that there was sufficient military resources in the region to support all the operational requirements of efforts against Raqqa and Mosul taking place at the same time. But again, for the details about that, I'd refer you to the Department of Defense. And again, they're going to be a little limited in what they can describe about that situation.\nWith regard to the criticism from the Republican nominee, I'll just say that the President feels like he's getting military advice from the right place, which is men and women in the United States military who have dedicated their lives to serving the country in the military and protecting our country.\nQ: Just one more on the Senate race down in Florida. There seems to be some internal conflict about what the DSCC and the national group should be doing in terms of spending money there. Apparently, the DSCC has pulled out money from the Democratic candidate, and sort of shifted funding to other Senate races. The President is going to be going down to Orlando later this week. Does he have an opinion one way or the other on whether Democrats should try as hard as possible to take out Marco Rubio and invest in that for the future as some, like Senator Nelson, have apparently said?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I can tell you that President Obama is traveling down to Florida because he believes that Congressman Murphy is the right person to represent the state of the Florida in the United States Senate. And he will reiterate that case once again on Friday, in Orlando. The President feels strongly about race. The President, months ago, endorsed Congressman Murphy's campaign and has made numerous trips to Florida to support it.\nWhen it comes to the strategy that's implemented by the DSCC, those are decisions for them to make. But the President is certainly committed to strongly supporting Congressman Murphy's campaign, and is optimistic about his prospects.\nMark.\nQ: Just to follow up on my seatmate here, can you think of anyone that President Obama would like to take behind the gym? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Not off the top of my head.\nQ: What's on his schedule today that it's conspicuously empty?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President has a couple of internal meetings with staff, and I know that he's got at least one call that he's planning to make later today to a foreign leader. And we'll have some details about that call a little later. But, yeah, it's a relatively light schedule for the President today after several days on the road.\nQ: Can I also raise the question about why a number of the President's fundraisers the last three days were closed to any press coverage?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there were a couple of them that were closed to press coverage, and this is consistent with the approach that we've been following for more than seven years now, which is that when the President does an event at a private home where he's not making formal remarks at the beginning, then that's not open to press coverage. And that simply is because the President is typically gathered in a room that has fewer people than are gathered in this room, and is engaging in a conversation and less of a speech.\nSo in those occasions where the President is giving formal opening remarks, like he was on Sunday night, for example, even though it was taking place in a private home, the print pool was allowed in to hear the President's case. And given the pointed remarks he had about the candidacy of Colonel Applegate there in southern California, in his race against Congressman Issa, I think the President was pleased to have the opportunity to make some news.\nBut in settings where there's a smaller number of people involved, the President is more interested in just having a conversation.\nQ: You know we're interested in his remarks formal or otherwise, right?\nMR. EARNEST: Oh, I'm aware of your abiding interest in all presidential remarks.\nQ: Does the White House make a transcript of his remarks in those settings?\nMR. EARNEST: They typically do not, no.\nQ: So if you're not there, the White House staff wouldn't know about it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, sometimes I'll sit in on those remarks, and that's just because sometimes the President's comment, even in a private conversation, occasionally will leak out into the public. And sometimes the way that it leaks out is not true to the President's actual words, and so I certainly will -- have in the past -- try to help reporters, who are getting leaked information about what the President said, understand exactly what the President did say.\nQ: You mentioned a few weeks ago the possibility that you would let the press in for the Q&A portions of these fundraisers. Is that a possibility between now and Election Day?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know that the President is going to be doing too many more fundraisers between now and Election Day. But we'll certainly keep that option open.\nKaren.\nQ: Josh, if you'll indulge me, one more follow-up to the Vice President's comments asked a little differently. The First Lady has one of the most notable lines of this campaign. Hillary Clinton is quoting her on the campaign trail, saying, \"When they go low, we go high.\" What was the President's reaction to the Vice President's \"take him behind the gym\" comments? Is that going high?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I didn't speak -- I haven't spoken to the President about the Vice President's comments. I think what the Vice President would tell you is that the rhetoric that we've heard from Republicans has aroused strong feelings and strong views from everybody, particularly somebody like Vice President Biden who has dedicated his career in public service to preventing violence against women.\nSo I think the comments that you've seen from Vice President Biden are indicative of some deeply held values and principles that were called into question based on the offensive remarks of the Republican nominee for President. And again, I think you'd have to ask Vice President Biden for a more specific response, but that's my analysis about what happened. And I think that, at the same time, Vice President Biden would whole-heartedly agree with the wisdom that Mrs. Obama has been sharing with all of us about the need to, even when our opponents go low, to go high.\nQ: And back to the health care premiums. You say that you would not want people to be dissuaded from shopping at the marketplace and from signing up for plans, and that young people should still be signing up. The timing of this, though, is not great -- right before the open enrollment, two weeks before the election. Republicans are saying this vindicates what they've been saying for years, that your costs are going to go up. Has the White House changed its plan, as you said earlier about you're going to be aggressively promoting the open enrollment phase? Do these headlines change how you're going to approach that over the next couple of weeks? Is the message different now than it would have been a month ago in the planning?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me start by saying, at the risk of being repetitive -- when Republicans say, \"I told you so, your costs are going to go up,\" they're not telling the truth. For the vast majority of people who go to shop on the marketplace, they will be paying $75 a month or less for their health care. That's affordable. That's about the cost of a cellphone bill.\nWhat we've also seen is that for the health care market overall, over the last several years, since the Affordable Care Act went into effect, the growth in health care costs has been held down at all-time lows. Even individuals who aren't purchasing their health insurance through the marketplace, but get health insurance through their employer -- when you tally up the savings that they've enjoyed since the Affordable Care Act went into effect, for the average family it's $3,600. That's a substantial sum of money for a middle-class family. And it's a testament to the success of the Affordable Care Act in holding down the growth in premium costs for people who get health insurance through their employer, to say nothing of the savings that are enjoyed by businesses who are also paying part of the health care bill of their employees.\nSo the rhetoric that we've seen from Republicans does not withstand scrutiny and is not consistent with the basic responsibility that they have to put the interest of their constituents first. Particularly when you consider that the stakes are as high as health care, that should be an occasion to put politics aside to try to solve some problems.\nBut for seven years, Republicans have refused to pursue that approach. And look, I think they think that there is an opportunity for them to score some political points. But you'll recall, back in 2012, Republicans vowed to make the President's reelection a referendum on the Affordable Care Act. And the President was reelected on with more than 51 percent of the vote.\nSo we've seen this strategy implemented in a national race before, and it failed. And I'm skeptical it's going to work this time, as well.\nQ: And the White House is campaigning over the next couple of weeks to get people to keep shopping and purchase, and not drop out of the marketplace?\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah. And I think what we're going to do is we're just going to do our very best to try to make sure that people understand what's available to them, give people the tools that they need to go and educate themselves. And starting November 1st, a week from today, people can go to HealthCare.gov and take a look at the options that are available to them and their families. And many people will find that there are some good options there.\nAnd this is another fact that is a little confusing, and sometimes hard to convey, Karen, but it's important for people to understand: This is true even of people who purchased their health insurance through the marketplace last year; that a lot of people may feel like, well, I like the health care that I've had over the course of the last year, and so I'm not going to make any changes.\nWe encourage people to shop around, even if you already have health insurance and even if you purchased it last year. What some people will find is that there is a comparable plan that offers about the same level of benefits that in some cases could save them up to 20 percent on their premium costs. So it's worth shopping around, particularly if people are sensitive to the costs.\nSo again, this is complicated. And sometimes it just does get reduced to health care prices spiking all across the country. And it doesn't reflect the complexity that we're seeing on the ground. That's not to minimize some of the challenges that we face in some states in some aspects of the market that are facing some middle-class families.\nThe President has put forward some specific solutions that would address those concerns. But for the vast majority of the American public, they're extraordinarily well served by the reforms that were put in place under the Affordable Care Act.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I just want to circle back at least a little bit. You said for Republicans who are now running around saying, \"We told you so,\" you said prices have not gone up, that's just not true.\nIs it partially true, at least, you can acknowledge that prices for at least three in ten of the folks who are on the Affordable Care Act, their prices may, in fact, go up?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the fact is, Kevin, that we've seen -- we saw significant price increases before the Affordable Care Act went into effect. And in large part, for the vast majority of Americans, we found creative ways to limit those price spikes. Are there still some places where we can improve the law? Absolutely. In a way that will benefit everybody all across the country? Absolutely.\nUnfortunately, the only thing Republicans are willing to vote on is to repeal the law, which would only have the effect of jacking up the deficit, jacking up health care costs, and kicking 20 million Americans off their health insurance plan. That's not a solution. And it certainly would not leave the American people better off. But it's what Republicans keep proposing because somehow they think it's going to be good politics for them. They're wrong, particularly because I think the American people understand that Republicans in Congress don't have a good track record as problem solvers right now. And that's true not just with health care, but that's true across the board.\nQ: But it is partially true then that, for some, prices did in fact go up, is what I'm trying to drill down on. You said it's not true. And it's at least partially true -- you would acknowledge that.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think we can go and check the transcript. I think I was pretty accurate when I said that for the vast majority of people, the growth in health care costs is going to be limited because of the tax credits. And that certainly undermines the argument that Republicans have been making.\nQ: You also said something interesting. You said, in comparing Arkansas and Oklahoma, two vastly different results -- at least at first glance right now --\nMR. EARNEST: Yes.\nQ: -- you seemed to make the suggestion that the leadership in Oklahoma was intentionally sabotaging the Affordable Care Act at the expense of the health and wellbeing of their citizens. Is that a fair assessment of what you're saying?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think that's -- it's hard to explain why they wouldn't expand Medicaid. Particularly for the first three years when they had an opportunity to expand Medicaid, the government was going to pay 100 percent of the cost.\nSo I think it's hard to make the case on the part of Republicans in Oklahoma that they were looking out for the best interests of the thousands of people in the Oklahoma who would benefit from the expansion of Medicaid. We know the fact that Medicaid wasn't expanded has resulted in increased costs for everybody in Oklahoma, and it's prevented thousands of Oklahomans from getting access to the health care that they need.\nAnd the only explanation that you hear from policy makers in Oklahoma is that they don't like the Affordable Care Act. So again, if there's an alternate explanation, I'm happy for somebody to put one forward. But the easiest explanation, it seems to me, is that Republicans in Oklahoma are bound and determined to ensure that the Affordable Care Act fails. And that has negative consequences of people in Oklahoma. There's just no arguing about that.\nQ: Just a couple more. You said the President would be making a phone call to a foreign international leader today. Is it safe to assume that it won't be Mr. Putin or Mr. Duterte?\nMR. EARNEST: It's safe to assume that. But we'll have more details on the call shortly. It may be that the call is going on right now, and that it would just be bad form to announce the call while they're still talking. So that's why -- we'll have news on the call shortly. There's no big mystery here. I don't want you to be -- I'm just trying to demonstrate some good manners. That's all.\nQ: Understood. I also wanted to give you a chance to clean up a little bit of space between what I believe you were suggesting about the President's timeline and his knowledge of Secretary Clinton's private email server or email account. There's just been a little bit of back-and-forth, especially with the latest WikiLeaks revelation. I just want to share something -- you probably have read this too -- Cheryl Mills saying to John Podesta, \"We really need to clean this up,\" talking about the idea that the President may have learned about this not from press reports as he said to Bill Plante in an interview on March 7th. He said he learned the same time everybody else learned it, and that's through news reports. Can you help me understand the difference?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I can't speak to the emails. You were talking about stolen emails from a private citizen. What I can tell you is that the President's explanation in March of 2015 and my explanation about what the President knew in March of 2015 hasn't changed. And the truth is, this is just critics of Secretary Clinton and President Obama recycling a conspiracy theory that's already been thoroughly debunked.\nSo does this mean that they've run out of conspiracy theories and they have to go back to one that's already been debunked? Maybe. But I guess you'd have to ask them.\nThe truth of the matter is, there is nothing about what I said in March of 2015 that has changed at all. And frankly, it doesn't even change based on what's revealed in the stolen emails of a private citizen.\nDavid.\nQ: Josh, back on TPP. You've said for a while now, many months, that the White House has been in contact with leaders on the Hill about the right timing to bring TPP forward for the long-awaited vote in Congress. What's changed after the election that that would mean the timing is right? Is it that vulnerable Congress members wouldn't have to take that tough vote right ahead of this election? Is that the only difference? And why does that make sense for the public to believe that in a trade deal this important, that's the right process to sort of treat this with?\nMR. EARNEST: David, I think the bottom line is -- the real difference is, is that Congress will be back in town. And you heard Republicans in Congress use the upcoming election as an excuse not to do a whole bunch of things, including fulfilling their basic responsibility to consider the President's nominee to the Supreme Court. This is the nominee that has got more experience on the federal bench than any other Supreme Court nominee in history.\nAnd so Republicans haven't been able to articulate an opposition to his candidacy; they have just said that they don't want to do anything because the election is coming up. They have taken a similar approach with TPP and a range of other issues. So if they're saying they want to procrastinate and wait until after the election --\nQ: The question is, do you think that that's the right way to go, though? You have members who are voted out, who have maybe less to lose. Is that right for the biggest trade deal -- regional trade deal in history? That that would be the right time to --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, if your question goes to, would the President have preferred that they voted to ratify the Trans-Pacific Partnership earlier this year, the answer is an unequivocal yes.\nQ: The question more is, does the President think that it makes the most sense to -- I mean, this is an important trade deal. If it stands on its own, why not allow it to go forward under the next Congress that's one that's -- and the next President?\nMR. EARNEST: The President would have strongly preferred the Congress voted earlier this year to approve the agreement. If they're going to put off all their work until the end of the year, they're a separate branch of government; there's not that much that we can do about it other than making sure that they do their job. And we hope that they're going to do a lot of things when they get back after the election, including taking up the nomination of Chief Judge Garland and ratifying the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nQ: Secretary Clinton has said, again recently, she'd vote against the deal now; she's against the deal after the election on TPP. If TPP does not get voted on or approved while President Obama is in office, President Obama took three trade deals that had been left on the table signed by President Bush, ultimately added side deals to each of those, and got it approved by Congress during his presidency with Korea, Panama, and Colombia, I believe.\nDoes the White House have confidence that Secretary Clinton, if elected President, would go forward and try to improve the deal, as she's talked about, and possibly push it for a vote in her first term?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I'll let Secretary Clinton's team discuss what she will do once she takes office if she is elected.\nWhat I can tell you, and the case that we have made to members of the United States Congress who we know support these kinds of agreements at least in principal, is essentially two things.\nThe first is, the agreements that you cited were important agreements and the President did have some success in strengthening those agreements and then signing them and submitting them to Congress for their approval. But those are bilateral agreements. With the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the United States was negotiating with 11 different countries, all of whom were also negotiating with each other. And so changing the nature of that agreement once it's been signed is extraordinarily complicated. There's a reason that it took what, six, seven, eight years to negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership in the first place. To undo it and try to renegotiate it is something that would, even if it's possible, would be extraordinarily complicated. That's the first argument that we have made.\nThe second is, that if there are people who -- in either party -- who support these kinds of agreements in principle, there's a strong argument to be made that they should approve the treaty when the President who shares the same community to those principles is still in office.\nBut ultimately it will be up to individual members of the House and Senate to make that determination. What I'll say is that, even in the context last summer, there were loud and public and passionate statements made by the opponents of the Trans-Pacific Partnership urging Congress not to give the President the authority that he needed to complete the agreement. And it was a heavy lift to convince a Republican-led Congress that they should give the Democratic President of the United States additional authority to negotiate a trade deal, particularly in the face of this bipartisan opposition on the campaign trail.\nSo even in the face of those long odds, we succeeded in building a bipartisan majority in the Congress to get that done. The President was given that authority, we encountered some snafus along the way, as you may recall, but we did succeed in getting that across the finish line.\nRatifying the TPP should be an easier vote. First of all, you don't need to get 60 votes in the Senate in the same way that we needed 60 votes in order to get the authority to negotiate the deal. Now there are tangible benefits that individual representatives in Congress can point to, to explain their vote. And we can get back the slides out again, if we want to, with the cowboy boots and the barbeque sauce and all the other stuff, that indicate that there are specific products in the United States -- specific taxes imposed by other countries that will be reduced as a result of their vote.\nSo there's a stronger rationale for the vote. There is a stronger, more specific economic case that we can make about the benefits that the country will enjoy based on the approval of the agreement. And the legislative process is not nearly as complicated as it was last summer. So that's why we continue to retain confidence and that's why we continue to have confidence in the argument that we can make to Congress that this is something that supporters of agreements like this should pursue when they return to Washington in a few weeks here.\nMike.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. In some of the follow-up reporting that my colleagues are doing on this enlistment bonus issue, it appears there was an effort by California guard officials in 2014 to raise this potential problem at least to members of Congress. And there was some effort legislatively to try to get around this.\nNow there's some finger-pointing about why that amendment to the Defense Authorization Bill wasn't approved. Some of those fingers are being pointed at the Pentagon. One lawmaker said that the Pentagon told them that the Defense Secretary already had the authority to forgive those repayments involved. Are you aware of whether this was on the White House's radar at that point in 2014, or is it safe to say that this was just a on your radar this week when it was reported?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know to what extent or even whether this particular situation was communicated to the White House in 2014. I can't account for all those conversations. What I can account for is the President's passion for making sure that our servicemembers are treated fairly, particularly when we're talking about our men and women in uniform who signed up to serve our country overseas in a very dangerous place. When we make promises to them, we need to keep them. And we certainly need to make sure that they aren't unfairly punished for people who may have acted inappropriately or misled them as they were reenlisting.\nSo that's an important principle. And the President is ready for the bureaucratic explanations and the political finger-pointing to end, and for this problem to get solved. And to his credit, Secretary Carter has laid out a path for doing that just today. And the President has an expectation that they'll fulfill the commitment that Secretary Carter made in his announcement today.\nQ: One of the ways this issue came to light is because the California guard -- there was an audit that happened in California that discovered this problem specific to the California guard. But it appears that this could be a nationwide issue. Is there any effort separately underway by the White House? Or are you confident in the Pentagon being able to manage this in determining whether this was a nationwide issue?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'd refer you to the Pentagon for an evaluation of whether or not this is something that -- well, actually, the National Guard Bureau at the Pentagon has ordered audits in all states and territories. So if this is something that -- if this is a problem that has cropped up in other states, the Pentagon is interested in knowing about it so that they can, again, fulfill the spirit of the President's declaration that we need to make sure that our servicemembers are being treated fairly, particularly when we're talking about our men and women in uniform who serve our country overseas.\nQ: And while we were sitting here, there was a statement out from Jeff Miller, who's the Chairman of the Vets Committee in the House. And he's calling the announcement from the Pentagon, \"…a weak and ham-handed attempt to shift the focus away from the Obama administration's shameful treatment of servicemembers and veterans…this is the same inexcusable incompetence from the Obama administration…\" He makes a connection to the VA scandal separately. I wonder if you care to respond to Jeff Miller.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm just curious about whether or not he put that statement out on campaign letterhead or his official letterhead. It sounds like a campaign statement.\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, he is on the ballot in a couple weeks. It sounds like somebody who is.\nQ: He's not.\nMR. EARNEST: He's not running for reelection?\nJohn.\nQ: Thank you, Josh.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, why don't we do John Decker, and then, John, we'll do you next.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Josh. Prior to the announcement today from the Pentagon regarding the suspension of the reenlistment bonuses, there was actually a coming-together in Congress, both the Democratic Leader in the House and House Speaker, Paul Ryan -- had spoken about putting together some sort of legislative fix to this problem. Given the announcement, which came out from the Pentagon today, does the President feel there is no need for any type of legislative fix for this particular issue?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it's not clear to me exactly what constructive role Congress could play here. But the President has got -- does believe that the Department of Defense is being responsive to his desire to make sure that our servicemembers are being treated fairly. And they've laid out a pretty clear path for acting expeditiously to make that happen for the thousands of National Guard members who are affected.\nBut I'll let Congress do whatever it is they're going to do in terms of speaking to potential solutions. But typically what we hear from Republicans in Congress is more along the lines of what Mr. Miller was stating, which is an effort to point fingers and score political points, and not actually solve problems.\nQ: The announcement today was forward-looking. It talked about a suspension of these reenlistment bonus payments. But it didn't look backwards. So for servicemembers that had been paying back the government, perhaps as much as $600 a month, to reimburse the government for their reenlistment bonus, is there some sort of contingency for those individuals so that they're made whole for giving back that money to the government? After all, they signed on the dotted line. They made a commitment to the government to serve six years, perhaps a tour in Afghanistan, a tour in Iraq. And in return, they expected a bonus. So as it relates to looking backwards, is there a move on that front coming from the Pentagon, as well?\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah, John, I think somebody asked this question earlier, which is the President does believe that all servicemembers should be treated fairly, including those servicemembers who may have paid back their bonuses even if they didn't need to. So the President's expectation is that every case and every servicemember who's affected in this situation will be treated fairly.\nJust to be clear about the suspension that you described earlier in your question, it's important for people to understand that what the Department of Defense is suspending is the effort to collect bonuses that may have been improperly paid. They're not suspending the payment of bonuses. They're suspending the effort to go and recoup those bonuses. So just make sure people understand.\nJohn.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. You recently announced that the President would be visiting Greece, I believe, November 15th. And I think this is his last official trip overseas as President. I understand that the economy and refugees are going to be topics for discussion. Will debt relief be on the table between the President and Prime Minister Tsipras? And given the historic nature of the trip, what does it say in terms of future relations between Washington and Athens?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, John, I can tell you the President is not traveling to Greece to go and negotiate some sort of new financial arrangement between Greece and the EU. I would anticipate that the President will spend some time on this trip complimenting the Greek government for the success that they have had in implementing the reforms that they committed to make. He will also encourage them to continue the path of reform that is good for the long-term economic and fiscal situation in Greece. And so that will certainly be an important part of that conversation the President will have there.\nWhen it comes to the longer-term relationship between the United States and Greece, obviously there are -- there's a significant Greek-American population here in the United States, and they're quite interested in making sure that there continues to be a strong relationship between our two countries. Many Americans travel to Greece on vacation and tourism and enjoy the opportunity to visit the country. I think it's an indication of the deep cultural ties between our two countries.\nAnd there's an important economic relationship as well. And the President is interested in underscoring all of that as he makes his own historic trip to Greece for the first as President.\nQ: My other question was, when the President campaigned for Attorney General Masto, in Nevada, in the Senate race, he made reference to the Republican candidate, Congressman Heck's statement of October 8th that he was dis-endorsing Donald Trump for President, and said it was \"too late.\" And then he led the crowd chanting \"Heck No!\" afterward.\nMy question is this: It was indeed October 8th that the Congressman dis-endorsed Donald Trump for a very personal reason, by the way. Does the President have more respect for people such as, say, Senator Toomey who has never endorsed Donald Trump, or Congressman Kinzinger, who said he will write in another name? Or is there a timeline when it's too late for a Republican to repudiate Trump? Or a time when he should have repudiated him?\nMR. EARNEST: I think you'd be hard-pressed to make the case that somehow not taking a position is worthy of praise in this particular situation. And that is the approach that at least one Republican Senate candidate has -- one Republican senator has taken. I don't think that he's likely to be chronicled in a future edition of \"Profiles in Courage,\" at least not for that public stance.\nLook, I think the President made a powerful case in terms of indicating his frustration with Congressman Heck and other Republican Congress members who seem to be more motivated by poll numbers than the actual offensive comments of the Republican nominee. After all, there were a whole litany of controversial comments that were made by the Republican nominee that didn't prompt Congressman Heck and others to change their position.\nIt was only after the string of those controversial comments started to have an impact on the nominee's poll numbers and the poll numbers of Republicans further down the ballot that we started to see some Republicans changing their position. That's the nature of the case that the President was making. And, yes, I think you can expect him to continue making that case across the country in the days leading up to Election Day.\nBill Press, nice to see you.\nQ: Good to see you, Josh. Thank you. I'm going to go back to the emails for just a second -- not the timing of it, but the quantity. There were 18 emails released that were identified as emails between the President and the Secretary of State. And the question has been raised: During the four years, did they only communicate by email 18 times? Wouldn't that be strange? Wouldn't there be, one would expect, many more?\nMR. EARNEST: No, not really -- primarily because you would expect that the communication between the two of them would typically occur in their regular meetings in the Oval Office, or regular national security meetings in the Situation Room, or secure telephone calls where they could discuss sensitive information. As the State Department has indicated, none of the emails between the President and Secretary Clinton included classified information. And at least when it comes to work, most of their conversations were going to be a discussion of sensitive information. And that's why they had to choose alternative methods of communicating.\nQ: Which begs the question, given John Podesta's experience, does the President still communicate by email using a pseudonym or whatever? And isn't that kind of risky?\nMR. EARNEST: The President does continue to use his iPhone, and he does continue to email people. As he told Jimmy Kimmel earlier this week -- noted presidential inquisitor Jimmy Kimmel -- the President said that he was very conscious of what he included in an email because of the likelihood that one way or another, it was likely to become public.\nQ: He uses a pseudonym always?\nMR. EARNEST: Excuse me?\nQ: He uses a pseudonym, obviously.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously, his email address is not BObama@whitehouse.gov. (Laughter.)\nChristophe, nice to see you.\nQ: Thank you. It's good to be back after a long time. I wanted to ask about the trip to Germany. This comes a little bit as a surprise to the German public, because when President Obama visited the Hannover fair in spring, it was considered to be his last visit to Germany. What is the reason? Is he so concerned about the way Europe is going, about all the problems? And it's not only the TPP, but also the T-TIP is in dire straits. So is this the main reason why he's coming again before he's leaving, that the situation is so strange, and we wonder where politics is more crazy on this side or the other side? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think -- I'm confident that there will be a discussion of T-TIP when the President travels to Germany both in his conversations with Chancellor Merkel but also with other European leaders that he's likely to see while he's there.\nBut the President would not agree with your assessment that the T-TIP is in dire straits. The President has set an ambitious goal for his negotiators to try to complete the T-TIP negotiations before the end of the year. When the President laid out that goal earlier this year, he indicated that he knew that would be an ambitious timeline. And that's a timeline they haven't reached yet. But they're continuing to push, and they're working to try to meet that ambitious goal. And if there's something that the President can do in the context of those conversations, then he'll look to do that.\nMore generally, I think the President is interested in traveling to Europe once again and to Germany once again to underscore how important our alliance is. And the President's trip to Germany came before the Brexit vote. But I think the President will come with a message that's similar to the one that he hoped to convey at the Hannover Messe.\nThe President gave a speech, you'll recall, where he talked about how the European people should be confident in the progress that they have made in integrating their countries and integrating their economies in a way that has unleashed remarkable prosperity for their people; that has made the continent more peaceful, more prosperous, more fair. That's not to paper over many of the challenges that the nations of Europe face. But it's important that those challenges don't obscure the remarkable progress that the countries of Europe have made, particularly when you consider that Europe was the site of some pretty significant wars on two different occasions over the last hundred years or so.\nAnd even in the aftermath of those widespread, bloody conflicts, Europe has been able to pursue an integration that protects the identity of the citizens of the various countries of Europe, but also allowing them to benefit from relationships that strengthen their economy, strengthen their security, and improve their quality of life. And the success of European countries working together only enhances the prospects of the United States because of the important ties that the United States has that strengthen our national security and strengthen our economy.\nSo the stakes are significant, and I would anticipate that you'll have an opportunity to hear the President talk about this more eloquently than I just did. But I think it will be interesting nonetheless.\nChris.\nQ: Josh, Democrats led by Senator Richard Blumenthal are sounding the alarm over the potential inclusion in the Defense Authorization Bill of an amendment that would undermine President Obama's executive order prohibiting anti-LGBT discrimination among federal contractors. That provision is included in the statement of administration policy as among things to which the White House objects. But can you say from the podium that the inclusion of this language alone would be enough to garner a veto from the President should the bill reach his desk?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Chris, at this point, I'm not prepared to single out particular elements of a potential Defense Authorization Act bill and say whether or not one proposal or another is going to draw a veto. But the inclusion of that provision in the House version is absolutely one of the reasons that the President would veto that bill in the unlikely event that it were to come to his desk in its current form.\nAnd the prospect that Republicans would hold hostage funding for our national security unless the President makes it easier for companies to discriminate against gay people is ridiculous, but unfortunately consistent with the pattern of behavior we've seen from Republicans in Congress over the last several years.\nSo the President does feel strongly about this, but I'm not prepared to single out specific provisions.\nQ: Other than -- from the podium, how has the White House made those views clearer to lawmakers?\nMR. EARNEST: I assure you that those views have been communicated very clearly to Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill.\nQ: Do you have any other meetings or any sort of --\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any meetings to read out to you, but there's no mistaking our -- well, let me just say it this way -- there's no mistaking the President's strong opinion on this issue.\nQ: And how confident are you that Republicans will actually hand a Defense Authorization Bill to the President that omits that language?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as I told Cheryl, I'm out of the business of predicting future congressional actions. We'll see what they do. It certainly is their responsibility to move that kind of legislation along. But they shouldn't use the need to pass that kind of legislation to try to jam through controversial provisions that, for example, make it easier to discriminate against gay people. That's not the right thing to do.\nThis gentleman in the back.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. Is the President following events in Venezuela? And if it is the case, what's reaction from the White House to what's going on in Venezuela with the military and the -- supposed to be trial of President Maduro?\nMR. EARNEST: The situation in Venezuela is one that is being closely watched by officials here at the White House. I don't have a specific response to the latest developments there, but we have, at every stage, urged the Venezuelan government and the Venezuelan people to resolve their differences peacefully. And much of the dysfunction that we see in the Venezuelan government right now is having a terrible impact on the population and on their economy. And the United States is hopeful that the differences can be resolved in the best interest of the Venezuelan people, many of whom are suffering quite deeply right now.\nOkay. Gregory, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Could you address the U.S. vote in the United Nations today on the Cuba embargo? Why the change in position from last year? And isn't it the duty of the executive to defend U.S. policy on the world stage even if you happen to disagree with the policies set by Congress?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Gregory, I know that Ambassador Power had an opportunity to address this shortly before I came out here. And why don't I just try to distill the argument that she made for you.\nFirst of all, what the United States did today was to abstain from the vote. And the reason for that is that it is the view of the United States that all actions of the United States with regard to Cuba have been and are fully in conformity with the U.N. Charter and international law, including applicable trade law and the customary law of the sea.\nBut the reason that the United States did make the decision to abstain from that vote is that the resolution is an excellent example of why the U.S. policy of isolation toward Cuba didn't work. It was in place for five decades, and, as measured by action in the United Nations, served to isolate the United States, not Cuba. And it certainly didn't have the desired effect of applying more pressure to Cuba with regard to human rights.\nThe United States has actually been able to work quite effectively through the United Nations to coordinate our efforts to apply pressure to countries that don't do a good job of protecting basic human rights. And the continuation of this policy only undermines our ability to make that case in the international community. That's one of the reasons that the President made the change. That working to start normalizing our relations with Cuba serves the interests of the American public by allowing more travel to Cuba, by allowing more Americans to enjoy the benefits of Cuban cigars and Cuban rum and other things that Cuba has to offer.\nQ: Classic cars.\nMR. EARNEST: Classic cars, for example, to name one example.\nBut what we're also interested in doing is trying to advance the interests of the Cuban people who have been oppressed for decades. And our ability to do that is only strengthened when we remove the impediment of an embargo that has been in place for five decades, that didn't work, and that only effectively isolated the United States. And that's why the President believes that we shouldn't vote again on a resolution that expresses opposition to the very policy that this administration is trying to end. And we'll certainly continue to make a case to Congress that they should take the actions that are necessary to remove the embargo.\nThanks, everybody, we'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 1:46 P.M.

{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "note": "Remarks as delivered.  Secretary Clinton was introduced by José Andrés, a famous Spanish-American chef who was awarded the National Humanities Medal in 2016.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119693", "text": "Thank you so much! Thank you. Wow, thank you all. What a great way to celebrate my birthday being here in Tampa!\nI am so, so grateful to Josй for that wonderful introduction. He's an incredibly talented chef, but more than that, I have to say he's a humanitarian. He just came back from Haiti, once again, where he goes periodically to help feed people. He's been doing it ever since the terrible earthquake, going to help people in remote villages – and he does that all over the world when it comes to making sure that there are clean cookstoves so that people can cook, primarily women and children, without fear of getting sick from inhaling all the smoke. I enlisted Josй's help when I was Secretary of State on the clean cookstoves initiative. And as you heard, he's also a proud immigrant and – he is standing up to Donald Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric, and he's doing it in a very courageous way because he sacrificed his business. He'd been asked by the Trump Organization to put a restaurant into the new hotel that Trump was talking about on TV today, in Washington, and after Josй heard the kinds of things that Donald Trump was saying about immigrants, he said, 'No, I refuse to open a restaurant in that hotel.' That is really gutsy.\nAnd today was a perfect time to have Josй be with us because, as I said, Donald Trump is taking time off the campaign trail to officially open the hotel. And yesterday, here in Florida, he took time out to invite the press to listen to his employees talk about what a great boss he is while he was watching and listening to them.\nAnd today, in opening that hotel, I think it's important to note that he once again relied on undocumented workers. The same people he has been insulting and demonizing throughout this campaign. So, like with so much else that Donald Trump says, he says one thing and then he does something different. Many of the products in the hotel were made overseas rather than here in the United States, and he even sued the District of Columbia to pay lower taxes. That is the way that he does business.\nNow, we've actually learned in this campaign that Donald Trump is the poster boy for everything wrong with our economy. He refuses to pay workers and contractors from Atlantic City to Miami to Las Vegas. He stiffs small businesses. I take that one personally because my dad was a small businessman. And I've met so many people who did projects for Donald Trump – provided pianos for one of his casinos, installed drapes for one of his hotels, laid the marble, put in the glass, washed the dishes, painted – and then weren't paid. I just think that is fundamentally wrong and that is not the kind of experience we need in the Oval Office.\nSo I'm grateful to Josй and I want to thank everyone else – my great friend, your United States Senator Bill Nelson. Congresswoman Kathy Castor. Mayor Bob Buckhorn, who's here with his two daughters. Governor Charlie Crist, soon to be Congressman Charlie Crist. I have to say, we've got two great candidates here: David Singer, candidate for the House of Representatives; and Rena Frazier, another candidate. And we have the great talent of Angela Bassett with us today.\nSo, my friends, here's the advice that I got. It is a beautiful day in Tampa, but it's warm. And some of you have been here a while, right? And I'm watching the flags. So long as they're waving, I know there's a breeze. If they stop waving, I'm really going to cut this short.\nBut let me start by thanking you – thanking you for being here.\n[Chants of \"Hillary!\"]\nThank you. Thank you. Well, I'll tell you, if I ever need a pickup, I'm coming back to Tampa, Mayor. And with 13 days left in this election, we cannot stop for a minute. No complacency here. Nobody— nobody flagging. We've got to get everybody out to vote. And I hope in addition to the people that I've mentioned, someone who's not here I hope you will support – that is Congressman Patrick Murphy, to send him to the United States Senate.\nI think you'll be pleased because he's an independent voice. He's a problem-solver. He believes in comprehensive immigration reform. He has stood with Planned Parenthood against the attacks that it has suffered. He has even brought Democrats and Republicans together to try to protect our environment and fund Everglades restoration. He'll stand up to the gun lobby and advocate for common sense gun safety measures. He'll defend Social Security and Medicare, not cutting or privatizing those two essential programs. So please, do your best to make sure we send Patrick Murphy to the Senate.\nNow, I got to ask you, anybody see the last debate? You know, I have now stood next to Donald Trump for four and a half hours, proving conclusively I have the stamina to do the job.\nAnd every time he says one of those outrageous things that he does have a – yeah, 'Wrong' – he does have a way of saying, I just keep remembering Michelle Obama's words: when he goes low, we go high.\nBut I got to say, he said something in the last debate we've never heard from anybody running for president. He basically said that he's not sure – he refused to say that he would respect the results of the election. Now, this is a guy who said the Emmys were rigged, so you can't really take what he says very seriously. But this is a problem because the first thing a president does at noon on January 20th is to take an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution. And if you are casting doubts, you want to keep people in suspense as to whether you will respect the outcome of an election, that is contrary to who we are as Americans. We have our elections; we've had them from George Washington forward. We're going to keep having them and show what a democracy looks like to the rest of the world.\nI believe strongly that the American people are going to reject this dark, divisive vision of America, and it's happening, my friends. We have reached a milestone. More than 200 million Americans are registered to vote. That's the biggest number ever. And that number includes 50 million young people. And you know what else? More than 10 million people have already voted, including 2 million right here in Florida.\nI'm hearing some great stories from people. Let me just tell you one. It's about Steven, from St. Augustine. He's been fighting a rare form of leukemia and heart disease. He's been in and out of the hospitals a dozen times in the last two years. But he knows how important his vote is. So I heard yesterday he ditched his oxygen tank, which I would not have recommended – clung to his walker, stood in line so he could cast his vote for a better America. And if Steven can do that, nobody has any excuses. And I think this extends not just to Democrats but to Republicans and independents, and I am proud to have support from Republicans and independents here, across Florida, and across America who agree with me that we should reject hate and division.\nWe have seen Donald Trump insult nearly every person in America, and I just find that so intolerable. Because look at this diverse crowd; look at Tampa. It's a cosmopolitan city. Florida is paving the way for what our country will look like, and we need to be lifting each other up, listening to each other, respecting each other, not sowing seeds of hatred and bigotry. And I think one of my biggest jobs after this election will be bringing our country together, and I'm going to need your help.\nWe're going to get the economy working for everybody, not just people at the top, with new jobs in infrastructure. That rail system, Bob, that you want, we're going to get it because it would help you so much. Think of the people we'd put to work – technology, innovation, research, advanced manufacturing, and yes, small business. I want to be the best small business president you can have, to help people start and grow their businesses. But we're also going to make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. I know we can create millions of jobs, and we can protect Florida, especially coastal Florida, and we can protect our planet at the same time. You're already seeing the results of climate change here in Florida. I was just in Miami, and they actually have flooding on sunny days with no rain. People are calling 3-1-1 because they think a water main broke, but it's the oceans rising. So I know there is no state that could benefit more from a clean energy agenda than Florida, and that's exactly what we're going to do.\nWe're also going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free. If your family makes less than $125,000, which is most families in America, you're not going to have to pay a penny to go to a public college or university. If your family makes more than that, you're not going to have to go into debt – pay what you can afford, and then we're going to make sure you can go without getting a big debt, because that drags people down. And for people who already have debt, we are going to help you refinance it and pay it off.\nAnd I want to say something to all of the teachers and educators. I want to work with you and be a good partner with you. And I think there should be more than one way, more than just a four-year college degree, to get a good job with a good middle-class life for you and your families. So let's invest in more technical education in high school, in our community colleges. Let's have more apprenticeship programs – labor and business together.\nBut while we grow the economy, let's make it fairer. We need to raise the national minimum wage so that people who work full-time aren't left in poverty. I got to tell you, I was raised to believe in hard work. My grandfather was a factory worker, my dad had a small business, and we really believed you've got to work for what you get in life, right? But if you're working, you shouldn't be at the point where you cannot even afford food or clothes or rent at the end of the year.\nAnd isn't it finally time to guarantee equal pay for women's work? You know, this is not just a women's issue. This is a family issue. If you've got a mother, a wife, a sister, or a daughter working, it's your issue. And unlike my opponent, we're going to ask the wealthy, the millionaires and billionaires, to pay their fair share, because we're going to close the loopholes and make sure no multimillionaire ever pays a lower tax rate than a nurse or a teacher or a police officer or a firefighter. And I will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000 a year.\nSo when you go to the polls, vote to grow the economy, more jobs with rising incomes, vote to make the economy fairer. And compare that with what my opponent has proposed. He really believes if you give trillions – that's trillions with a 't' – trillions in tax cuts to the wealthy, millionaires, billionaires, big corporations, everything will trickle down. Now, we know that doesn't work; we've seen it. And it's pretty rich coming from a guy who claims to be so rich, who hasn't paid a dime in federal income taxes in 20 years. He says not making taxes makes him smart. Well, I don't know. I don't know how smart you have to be to lose a billion dollars in one year. And besides, what kind of genius loses money running a casino, for heaven's sakes?\nActually, it sounds like a few people have been at casinos here. But this means he's contributed zero, okay? He actually has the gall to call our military a disaster. Not only is he wrong, but what right does he have to say that? He hasn't contributed a penny to our military, not a penny to our veterans, not a penny to health care or education, not a penny to highways or infrastructure. This is a false – false – charge that he makes about all the problems in our country.\nAnd I'll tell you something; we did a little research. He's been denigrating America for decades. This didn't start with his birther lie against President Obama. It didn't even start running against me. Back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in The New York Times criticizing President Reagan. He said our leaders were the laughing stock of the world. So this is a guy who criticizes everybody but himself. And at some point, you got to say, wait a minute, we're better than that. We are stronger than that. We want to forward – forward – into the future with confidence and optimism, and that's what we're offering in this campaign.\nI got to tell you, it is not just what we're against that should motivate you to go to the polls; it's what we are for. And I believe strongly that what we're for will make it possible for all of us, and especially our kids and our grandkids, to have the best future. America's best days can still be ahead of us. But we can't make any of this happen if we don't have you voting.\nNow, Donald Trump says he can still win, and he's right. That's why it's so important everyone gets out and votes. And here in Florida – in a lot of places, you can only vote on Election Day, but here in Florida, voting couldn't be easier. Early voting began on Monday. In south Florida, it goes through Sunday, November 6 around the state. You can go to an early voting site between 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. In fact, the County Center on East Kennedy Boulevard is just a 10-minute walk from here. You can go vote right after this event. And we'll have staff ready to help you get there. And you can go to iwillvote.com to confirm your polling place and make a plan to vote.\nBut I also hope you will volunteer these last two weeks. We're reaching out to everybody. So go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer. Take out your phone and text J-O-I-N, and that is 47246. We can use you. We're making millions of phone calls in Florida. We're knocking on maybe by the time we finish millions of doors.\nWe don't want anybody to be left out or left behind because on January 20th, America will have a new president. I've got to say – so I've got to say to you that change is inevitable in life. Right? And so the real question is, what kind of change are we going to have? And I want you to talk to anybody you know who is either thinking of not voting or maybe thinking of voting for my opponent. No. I'm serious. I'm serious. After this election, if I'm fortunate enough to be elected, we are going to reach out to everybody. Right? And ask. Ask the people you're talking to what kind of change they really want because I don't think most Americans want the kind of divisive and dark change Donald Trump is offering: mass deportations that will rip families apart, a repeal of gun-free school zones on day one, going back to the day when insurance companies could discriminate against us if we have a preexisting condition, letting Wall Street write its own rules, denying the science of climate change, rolling back marriage equality, defunding Planned Parenthood, the hugest tax breaks ever for the wealthy, and abroad abandoning our alliances and allowing more countries to get nuclear weapons.\"\nAudience: \"No.\"\nClinton: \"Now, that may be change, but, boy, that's not the change we need. And my vision is different. It's more hopeful, optimistic, and unifying. I want us to be a country where every student could afford to go to college if that's what you choose. I want us to be a country where millions of people are working in good, high-paying jobs and in new industries, like clean energy and advanced manufacturing. I want us to be a country where hard-working immigrants, who pay taxes – and, by the way, one-half of undocumented workers pay federal income taxes, which means they are paying more federal income taxes than Donald Trump paid. And a country where we not only have equal pay for our work but affordable childcare, where we're respected in the world, working with our allies to defeat terrorism and stop the spread of nuclear weapons. So yes, change is coming, The choice is yours about what kind of change we'll have.\nAnd I hope you will choose to be part of this campaign because it's not just about winning on November 8th, as important as that is. It is about getting to work because I do believe we are stronger together.\nTim Kaine and I wrote a book laying out our agenda because I think you deserve to know what I will try to do as your president. So if you will help, we will come together to give every American the chance to chart your own future and contribute to our great country.\nLet's prove once and for all that love trumps hate.\nThank you.", "timestamp": "2016-10-26", "title": "Remarks at Curtis Hixon Waterfront Park in Tampa, Florida"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122591", "text": "As part of President Obama's continuing efforts to assist communities negatively impacted by changes in the coal industry and power sector, today the Administration is announcing the second round of  grants awarded this year as part of the POWER Initiative's \"POWER 2016\" funding opportunity that invests in economic revitalization and workforce training in coal communities across the country. The awards announced today, totaling nearly $28 million, will support 42 economic and workforce development projects in thirteen states that are building a strong economic future in communities, and targeting various industry sectors, including manufacturing, information technology, agriculture, housing, and tourism and recreation. The awards are administered by the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) and the U.S. Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration (EDA).\nThe POWER (Partnerships for Opportunity and Workforce and Economic Revitalization) Initiative is a community-based Administration effort involving ten federal agencies working together to align, leverage and target a range of federal economic and workforce development programs and resources to assist communities and workers that have been affected by job losses in coal mining, coal power plant operations, and coal-related supply chain industries due to the changing economics of America's energy sector. The POWER initiative exemplifies a collaborative approach to federal partnership with communities that President Obama and his Administration have steadily advanced, which focuses on improving coordination across federal agencies, tailoring federal support based on local needs and priorities, encouraging local long-term strategic planning, and relying on data and evidence to inform solutions that work.\nThe POWER Initiative is the primary economic and workforce component of President Obama's broader  POWER+ Plan, part of his FY 2017 budget request to Congress. There is bipartisan legislation in Congress consistent with two of the President's POWER+ proposals that could have a significant positive impact on workers, communities and retirees in coal country, and complement the POWER Initiative's investments.\n1. The Miners Protection Act (S. 1714) and its House companion, the Coal Healthcare and Pensions Protection Act (H.R. 2403), mirror the President's proposal to transfer federal funds to strengthen the solvency of the largest multi-employer pension plan serving retired coal miners and their families, and to extend health care coverage to additional retirees, more than twenty thousand of whom will start to lose their existing coverage at the end of this year.\n2. The RECLAIM Act (H.R. 4456), which is consistent with the President's proposal to invest $1 billion in projects that link abandoned coal mine reclamation to economic development strategies, while stimulating economic activity and job creation in hard hit coalfield communities.\nCongress has the ability to pass this legislation before the end of the year and send it to the President's desk for his signature.\nThe awards announced today are from a competitive POWER federal funding opportunity that the ARC and EDA released in March of this year by to provide implementation, planning and technical assistance grants.\nPOWER Implementation Award Summaries:\n•      $3,000,000 ARC grant to Friends of Southwest Virginia in Abingdon, VA for the Building Appalachian Spring: Growing the Economy of Southwest Virginia project.

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119559", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n12:17 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Nice to see you all. I sense quiet anticipation. (Laughter.) I won't delay it. Let's go straight to questions.\nJosh, do you want to go first?\nQ: Sure. Thanks, Josh. You got us so excited in the briefing yesterday about anticipation of this readout that we didn't know where it was going to come from, and I wanted to ask you more about the President's conversation with Prime Minister Erdogan.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay.\nQ: I was struck by the line in the readout that said that the two leaders affirmed their strong support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq, given that the Prime Minister of Turkey doesn't seem to care a whole ton about the sovereignty of Iraq as it relates to the troops that they have there. And I was wondering if we would be right to read between the lines a little bit in terms of maybe they came to some type of an agreement about what Turkey's role should be given the fact that the operation to retake Mosul is already now well underway.\nMR. EARNEST: Josh, I think it's fair for you to describe that situation as an ongoing discussion. And the President -- President Obama underscored to President Erdogan the need for all of our counter-ISIL coalition operations to ensure that they're effectively integrated with the operations of other members of the coalition and to ensure that they are consistent with the request that's been made by the central government of Iraq. And the counter-ISIL coalition that is operating in Iraq in support of Iraqi security forces who are taking the fight on the ground to ISIL in their own country -- those efforts are being undertaken at the invitation of the Iraqi central government.\nAnd it's important to remember that this is actually in some ways the cornerstone of our strategy. If you rewind back to more than two years ago, when ISIL had demonstrated the clear threat that they pose to the Iraqi people, President Obama was reluctant to make a significant commitment of U.S. military resources until there was an Iraqi central government in place that reflected the will of the Iraqi people and demonstrated a clear commitment to pursue an inclusive governing agenda.\nSo this has been the foundation of our approach from the very beginning. And when it comes to the role that is played by particular countries who are part of the counter-ISIL coalition, as the situations change on the ground, as the threat that is posed by ISIL evolves, it often means that we are asking those partner countries to do more or to do something different. And so I think that's why I would describe the role of Turkey in the counter-ISIL coalition to be part of an ongoing discussion.\nI would be remiss if I didn't also note that there are already any number of significant contributions that Turkey is already making, including allowing our coalition, particularly the United States, to use the base at Incirlik, and the steps that Turkey has taken on the ground to secure their border with Syria that has essentially shut off ISIL and their capital, Raqqa, from easy access to the outside world.\nQ: And I wanted to correct myself -- I meant President Erdogan, not Prime Minister -- although he's had a couple different roles. I mean, is it a problem, though, that the operation is now underway and it's an ongoing discussion with our NATO ally about its role in an operation that's being led by the Iraqis that the Iraqis disagree openly with Turkey about what their role should be? I mean, can that be an ongoing discussion as the operation is already happening?\nMR. EARNEST: I think it can be an ongoing discussion because there clearly is going to be a role for international forces who are supporting Iraqi security forces on the ground in the operation against Mosul. So I don't know if we'll get to a place where there is a role that materializes for Turkish troops to support Iraqi security forces, but there already, as I detailed -- as I alluded to earlier, there are a couple of ways in which Turkey is playing a substantially important role to supporting the overall counter-ISIL mission.\nAnd, look, if there are additional requests that the Iraqi central government and the counter-ISIL coalition makes of the Turkish government, then we'll certainly include them in the ongoing dialogue. At this point, what the Iraqi government has indicated is that they are prepared for Iraqi security forces to take the lead. And we have seen them make steady and important progress against the goal of dislodging ISIL from Mosul. But we expect this will be a long and difficult challenge, but it is one that our counter-ISIL coalition is committed to supporting the Iraqis as they undertake.\nQ: With that operation underway, Defense Secretary Carter said yesterday that he expects the operation to take Raqqa back to start within a matter of weeks. And there's been a fair amount of criticism -- most notably, actually, from Donald Trump -- of previewing timing for a military attack publicly, given the potential for ISIL to use that information to prepare themselves to defend against such an attack. And I was wondering if the White House shares any concerns about being so open about the timing for that kind of an operation.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me start by saying that the President is confident that he's getting good advice from our senior leaders in the military, including the Secretary of Defense, about the most effective way to carry out our strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. And the President is confident that the advice he's receiving from those military advisors is better advice than anything that the Republican nominee might have to say two weeks before the election.\nQ: And I just wanted to ask about this call the President is doing this afternoon on the Affordable Care Act. Are you willing to acknowledge that the fact that he's doing this call and trying to speak to people who are affected and stakeholders is a reflection that, despite some of what you've said about the increases to premiums not being across the board, that there is a lot of apprehension right now with a lot of people who are feeling like maybe this isn't cutting costs the way that it was billed as being able to do, and that the President needs to sort of level with people about where his signature law now stands as he's leaving office?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Josh, let me point out that the President has done calls like this each of the last two years in advance of open enrollment, so there's nothing about recent headlines that has affected his decision to host the call. This is, in many ways, our standard operating procedure. And the goal of a call like this is to make clear to people across the country who are going to play an influential role in educating the American public about the law that this is a high priority of the President of the United States.\nWe want to make sure that people understand the facts about the opportunities that are available to them. And if people are discouraged about what opportunities are available to them, that might be understandable given the headlines, but it's not understandable given the opportunities that are available to the vast majority of Americans who sign up. Because more than seven in 10 Americans who sign up for the marketplace will be able to purchase a plan for $75 a month or less, after you factor in tax credits -- tax credits that exist because of the Affordable Care Act.\nSo that's why the President continues to be optimistic about the law and its impact on middle-class families across the country. And it's why the President continues to be energetic in making the case that this is a top priority.\nAnd we want to encourage people -- it doesn't cost anything to window-shop, and people can do that now by going to healthcare.gov and taking a look at the options that are available to them in their community. That doesn't cost anything. But what most people will find, particularly people who signed up last year, many people will find that there actually is a comparable plan that they can sign on to that could actually save them money, that would cost less. So we're encouraging people to shop around, whether they have health care or not. And that opportunity is available at healthcare.gov today.\nAnd finally, we know that the system, overall, benefits -- everybody's costs go down -- when more people sign up. So that's why we're making such an aggressive effort to include people all across the country, particularly young people, to encourage them to avail themselves of this opportunity.\nAll of this is particularly important when you consider that the penalty that is imposed for people who don't sign up for health care is quite significant. This year it's about $700. And I think our argument is pretty simple, which is, why would you pay $700 to Uncle Sam when you don't need to? You can avoid having to make that $700 payment if you go and sign up and for health care, which, of course, also affords you a variety of benefits that protect you and your family in the event of an illness.\nQ: And on that, just lastly, the plans that you pointed to this year, and others, that it costs $75 or so is affordable amount for people -- while they satisfy the individual mandate, as you know, they come, generally speaking, with very high copays, limited coverage for non-catastrophic types of measures. Would the President, if he were advising a family member or a friend who was maybe considering -- would he recommend one of those plans to them?\nMR. EARNEST: There are standards that -- the direct answer to your question is, yes. There are standards that are included in the marketplace. In order for a plan to be available for purchase on the marketplace, it has to meet a whole set of minimum standards. That's the argument that we make about quality, affordable health insurance being available on the marketplace.\nPrior to the creation of the Affordable Care Act, when individuals were on the individual market shopping for health insurance -- meaning they weren't able to get their health insurance through their employer or through Medicaid or through Medicare -- they were often subjected to the kinds of plans that cost money but provided very little, if any, benefit or protection for the people who were signing up. Those kinds of plans are a thing of the past now because people can now go on the marketplaces and know that the plans that they're considering for purchase are plans that do, at a minimum, provide a certain level of protection.\nSo it's hard to engage your question in a lot of detail because there are an average of 30 different plans that are available in markets all across the country. So if there are some plans that aren't tailored in the right way to meet the needs of one particular family based on the unique circumstances that they're facing, the good news is that there are a variety of other plans for them to consider, all of which can be made more affordable by tax credits based on the income level of the family that's signing up.\nSo that's the argument that we have to make. When you consider what was available before the Affordable Care Act, yes, the individual market was littered with expensive plans that in many cases didn't provide many benefits. That's a thing of the past now because the marketplace requires insurers to be transparent about both the costs and the benefits associated with their plans. It requires the insurance companies to compete with one another. And there are tax credits that are available now that make that health care more affordable for many middle-class families.\nAyesha.\nQ: Thank you. President Putin today, he once again batted away accusations that the Russian government or that Russia was in any way involved in the cyberattacks, or that Russia was in any way trying to influence the U.S. presidential election. He referred -- he said that, basically, U.S. politicians are trying to whip up hysteria, trying to increase U.S. government spending my making Russia into the culprit. I was just wondering if you had any response to some of these comments.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, did you expect that he would admit it? (Laughter.)\nQ: Well, I mean, but I was just asking --\nMR. EARNEST: I was asking, rhetorically. Look, what I'm trying to illustrate here is I don't think that his comments are particularly surprising. But the analysis that's been put forward by the intelligence community and the Department of Homeland Security is pretty direct in terms of what conclusions they have reached based on their analysis of the situation. And there's nothing the President Putin had to say today that I find particularly surprising or that in any way undermines the President's confidence in the analysis that's been released by the Department of Homeland Security and the intelligence community.\nQ: And on that, I realize that some of the response to the cyberattacks may not be able to be public, but can you say anything at all about where the administration is right now as far as deciding what a response may be, if there are going to be any public responses?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any updates on those ongoing discussions. Obviously, we've indicated that the President's expectation is that any sort of response that's deployed is one that should be proportional. And because of some steps that the President has taken, there are a variety of responses that are available to the President not just within the cyber realm, but in other areas, too. But I don't have any progress to report at this point about a potential response.\nQ: And I know that this is becoming a daily question, but Philippine President Duterte once again said today that there would be no more war games with the U.S. He said maybe they will do some naval exercises with Japan, but there would be no more war games with the U.S. Do you have any response to that? Has there been any formal communication from the Philippines about this?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have a response to this, primarily because I've offered up responses to similar questions that he's posed. I can confirm that we still have not received any sort of formal communication from the government of the Philippines seeking to alter the nature of our relationship or our alliance, but other than that, we'll leave it there, knowing that the United States continues to be committed to our alliance with the Philippines that's been on the books for seven decades.\nJustin.\nQ: I wanted to follow up on Josh's questions about the Erdogan call yesterday. The Turkish President provided a bit more colorful readout than you guys did in a speech this morning and said that he told President Obama that Turkey plans to liberate Raqqa itself. I'm wondering if that's accurate, and if so, if the U.S. is supportive of that plan, or if it runs kind of contrary to the collaborative effort that the U.S. is trying to I guess provide with the Iraqi government.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'll let President Erdogan and his team speak to his comments during the call. I don't have a lot of detail to provide beyond the written readout that we have provided. But the President reiterated in the context of that conversation something that he and President Erdogan have previously discussed, which is the need for all operations that are undertaken as a part of the counter-ISIL coalition must be coordinated and integrated with the other members of the coalition.\nAnd given the confined nature of the battle space in Syria, it's important that those actions are well-coordinated to prevent any sort of unintended consequence or unintended escalation among competing interests in that region of the world.\nSo we're mindful of how complicated this space is, but we've been pleased with the kind of cooperation and coordination that the Turks have offered over the last year. The Turks have offered access to the Incirlik Air Base that does make our counter-ISIL operations over Syria much more efficient than they were prior to U.S. aircraft getting access to that base.\nWe did see, after a lot of prompting on the part of the U.S., decisive action on the part of the Turkish government to take steps to clear ISIL from their border and more effectively secure their long border with Syria. We've complimented them for taking that step and they deserve it. Their forces have operated quite effectively on the ground to accomplish that mission, and we obviously were pleased to see them make that progress, not just because of the impact it has on our counter-ISIL campaign -- it's also going to have a positive impact on the homeland security of our NATO ally -- that we have seen ISIL occasionally carry out attacks on Turkish soil, and more effectively shutting down the border or securing that border will make it more difficult for ISIL extremists to carry out those attacks that claim our Turkish allies -- or the citizens of our Turkish ally as victims of those kinds of attacks.\nSo what we intend to do is keep an open line of dialogue with the Turkish government, with our NATO allies, and we all benefit -- all members of our counter-ISIL coalition benefit from ensuring that each operation that's undertaken under the umbrella of the counter-ISIL coalition is effectively coordinated and integrated with all other aspects of the campaign. If we do that, which we've been doing over the last couple of years, it will only hasten the success of our effort to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\nQ: And this might just be going down the same road again, but he also said that Turkey would not allow the Kurds to establish a base at Sinjar province. And the Kurds obviously have been an important part of U.S. efforts to go into some of these ISIL strongholds. What's your message to the Kurds? Or is the message that they should glean out of the list that you just provided of Turkey's attack of ISIL -- the effective steps that Turkey has taken, including offering an airbase, that those priorities are more important than the partnership between the U.S. and --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think, Justin, this is in some ways the clearest example of the complicated nature of this region. There are competing interests. The one thing that unifies these interests is the need to destroy ISIL. And so our message to everybody who shares that goal is that we should work together and take steps in pursuit of that goal. Let's not take our eyes off that ultimate accomplishment that will enhance everybody's security.\nAnd at some point, these competing interests and competing claims and even differing opinions will have to be resolved. But we shouldn't allow some of those differences of opinion to impede our collective effort to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. That's a goal we all share and a goal that we should all pursue together.\nQ: James Clapper said Tuesday that trying to get North Korea to dismantle its nuclear program is \"probably a lost cause.\" I'm wondering if you guys agree with that assessment and taking that that's the assessment of our intelligence community, whether the U.S. needs to prompt a change in its policy on denuclearization.\nMR. EARNEST: Justin, my understanding is that Director Clapper was making a reference to the fact that he did not anticipate that the strategy we have now would prompt the North Koreans to give up their nuclear program before the President leaves office.\nOver the longer term, we're going to continue to work with the rest of the international community to apply additional pressure to the North Korean regime to get them to come into compliance with a range of international obligations, including a variety of U.N. Security Council resolutions. And that's the strategy that we've pursued, and if the next President chooses to alter that policy, then that will be up to them. But we have had some success in mobilizing the international community, including some countries with whom we don't have the warmest of relations, including the Russians, to actually work with us on this goal.\nAnd in some ways, it underscores the complicated nature of our relationship with Russia, but it also underscores the significant threat that emanates from North Korea. And it's important for the United States to continue to play a leading role in mobilizing the international community to counter it.\nQ: Finally, a Trump campaign aide said that they were engaging in multiple efforts designed to -- voter suppression to go after -- to keep women and African Americans and other groups from going to the polls. It's not voter suppression I think in the historical way that we consider it, but obviously the strategy they're describing is to try to keep people from heading to the polls on Election Day. I'm wondering if you had a reaction to that, but also how or if that would inform the President's strategy as he continues his campaign travel over the next few days.\nMR. EARNEST: That strategy certainly runs contrary to the longstanding tradition of American democracy that has made our country great for more than 2 centuries. Those candidates who are the most optimistic and enthusiastic about their campaigns typically look for ways to win people over and bring them onboard, and to engage them in the democratic process -- the process of governing our country and determining who among our citizens should not just lead the United States of America but lead the free world.\nAnd that certainly is the kind of campaign that President Obama ran in 2008. It's certainly the kind of campaign that he ran in 2012. And I think you'd have to ask Secretary Clinton's campaign, but I think she would welcome the embrace of a similar philosophy of trying to win people over. And that certainly is the approach that you've seen President Obama take on the campaign trail in support of Secretary Clinton in terms of encouraging young people and African Americans and Latinos -- everybody -- to pay attention to the debate and participate in our democracy, because the President's view is that the more people participate the stronger our democracy is. Our country benefits from everybody making a contribution.\nAnd that's why his campaign philosophy was to engage and enlist and energize as many people as possible in support of his agenda. But I guess this is not the only way in which the Republican nominee's approach has differed from President Obama's approach -- both the politics and governing.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, aside from rallies and fundraising, what other kinds of campaign activities is the President engaging in that we don't know about because they're not done in public?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think you do know -- I think most of these are things that you do know about. In addition to the kinds of public events that you just described, the President has frequently been participating in interviews on the radio and encouraging listeners to be engaged in our democratic process and to support Secretary Clinton.\nThe President has also taped a number of television and radio advertisements, not just for Secretary Clinton but also for dozens of House and Senate candidates. We can get you a pretty good list of those. The President has also engaged in online activities, signing emails and other things, encouraging support for Secretary Clinton and Democratic candidates up and down the ballot.\nQ: Does that include state officeholders, governors?\nMR. EARNEST: It does. It includes some candidates for governor and it includes some candidates for state legislature. I think there are more than 100 or so that the President has indicated he publicly supports. There may be -- there's one other tactic that is something that may not be readily available to you for reporting, but the President has also taped a number of robo-calls that encourage people, remind people about Election Day and encourage people to be supportive of a candidate that he's endorsed. And if there hasn't been reporting on that yet I would anticipate that you'll see some reporting about that over the course of the next couple of weeks.\nQ: On another issue -- is the White House aware of the GAO report yesterday on the cost of presidential travel? It focused on a 2013 trip, Chicago and Palm City, Florida, four days, and it came up with $3.6 million for the costs -- mostly Air Force One, Marine One, the Coast Guard, Secret Service and the like. Is there any White House reaction to that report, and we're you given an opportunity to comment on it?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of the report. I hadn't seen it. But we can certainly take a look and see if GAO consulted with us in advance of issuing the report and if we have a response we'll let you know.\nAndrew.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I just wanted to follow up on Justin's question about Sinjar. The readout yesterday talked about denying the PKK a safe haven in northern Iraq. That sounds very much like the President agreed that the PKK need to get out of Sinjar. Is that kind of misreading that?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the United States government has labeled the PKK a terrorist organization, and we have repeatedly indicated our strong support for Turkish efforts to defend themselves from PKK attacks. There are a number of terrorist attacks that have been carried out by the PKK or their sympathizers over the last several years that have claimed innocent Turkish citizens as the victims. And we also know that the Iraqi government is concerned about the presence of these extremists in their country as well.\nSo I'm not aware that the President has made any sort of declarations along the lines of what you asked about, but our position as a government of the United States, supporting our Turkish ally as they face down a threat from this terrorist organization is something that we have communicated on a number of occasions, and our support for the Turks as they counter the threat from PKK terrorists is unwavering.\nQ: On a different subject, Ted Cruz has become the latest Republican to suggest that a Republican-controlled Senate wouldn't consider, or shouldn't consider any Democratic nominee to be Supreme Court justice. Does the White House agree with Harry Reid's assessment that that would prompt a fully blown constitutional crisis?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it certainly raises questions about the credibility and integrity of Republicans who said that the next President should get to choose who will fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. Because they're now saying -- at least a couple of them are saying that if Secretary Clinton wins the election she won't get to choose who serves on the Supreme Court. So that's the first thing.\nThe second thing is we hear rhetoric from a lot of Republicans -- not just Senator Cruz and Senator McCain and Senator Lee, all of whom have made similar comments -- but all Republicans who have indicated that they should be reelected so that they can provide a check or counter an incoming Clinton administration. Voters who hear that message I think are hearing -- and the President alluded to this on Monday -- voters who hear that message are basically hearing Republicans promise more of the same kind of Republican congressional dysfunction that infected Washington for the last six years.\nAnd I think this is the clearest evidence of it. Vowing to oppose any Supreme Court nominee that's put forward just because that person is put forward by a Democratic President is not consistent with the longstanding tradition of the United States Senate. In fact, it runs contrary to the longstanding tradition of the United States Senate, which is to evaluate candidates based on the merits. And Republicans this year have deviated from that tradition by refusing to even consider Chief Judge Merrick Garland to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court.\nChief Judge Garland is somebody that Republicans have previously described as a consensus pick. Chief Judge Garland has more experience on the federal bench than any other Supreme Court nominee in history. Chief Judge Garland was rated by the nonpartisan American Bar Association as unanimously well-qualified to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. And Republicans have indicated that they don't oppose him because of any specific substantive concern with his candidacy, but because they oppose him because he was appointed by a Democratic President.\nAnd the point that the President has made is that this undermines confidence in our judicial system. It undermines confidence in our justice system. And the reason is simply that the basic principle of our justice system is that everybody is subject to the rule of law in the same way. And if we get down to a system where judges or justices are only considered based on the political party of the President who appointed them it raises questions of the impartiality of that judge -- and raises questions about whether people will be treated differently in the justice system based on their own partisan affiliation. And that will do a lot of damage to a well-thought-out, carefully considered architecture that was put in place by our Founding Fathers.\nSo it would be a real shame if Republicans followed through on the strategy that Senator Cruz, Senator Lee and Senator McCain are advocating.\nQ: It sounds like you agree with Reid when he says we need to treat it like the constitutional crisis it is.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it certainly poses a significant threat to a longstanding tradition in the United States, which is ensuring that federal judges and potential justices to the Supreme Court are considered on the merits and their record and their approach to jurisprudence, and not just on the partisan affiliation of the President who appointed them.\nJordan.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. The First Lady is going out on the trail today with Secretary Clinton. I'm wondering how much more of the First Lady are we going to see in the final days of the campaign. Is she going to be making many more appearances, or is this going to be it for her?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have additional details about her schedule. I know that her intent today is to make a speech onstage with Secretary Clinton, and her intent is to deliver what she sees as a closing argument. She's had an opportunity to speak several times over the course of the summer and fall in support of Secretary Clinton's campaign, and she spoke very powerfully at the Democratic Convention in Philadelphia in July. And over the course of the fall she's had an opportunity to weigh in on those aspects of the campaign that have prompted her to take a bold stand in supporting Secretary Clinton. And today is an opportunity for her to talk about those same values and those priorities that animated her over the course of the campaign and put them in the context of a closing argument that she's looking forward to making for Secretary Clinton.\nQ: Outside of specific scheduling updates, can you give us a general sense of how much more she's going to be doing?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think, first of all, I'd point out she's already done a lot and there's not a lot of mystery about where she stands in this race or how strongly she feels about the outcome. And I think that she will -- I feel confident in saying that she'll find some additional ways between now and Election Day to reinforce those views to the American public.\nStephanie.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. So we're still seeing the slow drip-drop of the WikiLeaks release of John Podesta's emails.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, the stolen emails.\nQ: Yes, exactly. A few weeks ago I asked you if there were any policy changes within the administration in terms of emails and employees that are here or folks that are in high-level positions. And you said basically use common sense. And would you say John Podesta did not use common sense by clicking on this email that made him change his password and a phishing scam that hacked into the emails of DNC and Colin Powell, as well?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I'm not going to be in a situation of blaming the victim here. He is a private citizen whose personal emails were stolen. The tactics used to disseminate that information are consistent with the tactics that we know the Russians have used to try to cast doubt on the integrity and strength of our system of democracy.\nSo obviously this is something that is a source of some concern, not just within the government but I think it's a concern that's held by American citizens in both parties. But when it comes to the cybersecurity of the United States, we're in uncharted territory. And it's important for everybody, including your news organizations, to be vigilant and be mindful of the need to practice good habits when it comes to protecting yourself in cyberspace.\nYou heard the President make a reference to the fact that, when he uses email that he doesn't include anything in email that he wouldn't want to see in the newspaper. Some of that is because he is subject to the Presidential Records Act and there are some transparency requirements that are built in, but he is also mindful of the inherent risk that exists in cyberspace. So he is mindful of that in the same way that we all should be.\nQ: And to go back to Putin, Vladimir Putin today dismissed the claim saying Russia is trying to interfere in the U.S. election. What's your reaction to that, since the intelligence community has said Russia was trying to --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, it's not surprising to me that he is denying it. But it doesn't, in any way, undermine our confidence in the analysis that's been put forward by the intelligence community and the Department of Homeland Security.\nQ: Okay. And on the campaign, the President has repeatedly expressed that Donald Trump will not be the next President. Closer to Election Day, is the President at all concerned that he may be wrong? Is that why we're seeing him more on the campaign trail in this final stretch?\nMR. EARNEST: The President feels good about the trajectory of this race. The President is just as determined to make sure that no one feels complacent and particularly not supporters of Secretary Clinton. So he going to go out there and make an important case that the only way that Secretary Clinton loses the race is if her supporters don't do their job and don't go to the polls and show up for her and be just as energized and active in support of her campaign as they were of President Obama's two presidential campaigns.\nSo I guess the other point that I will make is that the other reason that the President is so deeply engaged and does have such an aggressive travel schedule for the 12 days between now and Election Day is that he's determined not just to build support and enthusiasm for Secretary Clinton but also to use his standing to build support and enthusiasm for Democrats further down the ballots, particularly congressional candidates.\nBecause he understands that if we're in a situation where Senator Cruz and his party retains the Republican majority, they are promising to use that majority to perpetrate even more dysfunction on the American people from Congress. And that's a curious election strategy when you see just how fed up even Republicans are with Republican leadership in Congress, but that's the strategy that they're pursuing and ignorance is no longer an excuse. There is no longer any doubt about the Republican vow to use every tool at their disposal to throw sand in the gears of the government. And they're not doing that because they think it's in the best interests of the country, they're doing that because they think it advances their own personal political interests.\nThis is not new for Senator Cruz. He's somebody who shut down the government, over the objection of some people in his party, just to try to raise his own profile and advance his own political interests. And it did. He raised a lot of money and spent a lot of time succeeding on the campaign trail. But there's nobody that I can think of who thinks that the interests of the American people were advanced by Senator Cruz shutting down the government. It didn't help our economy. It didn't improve our fiscal outlook. It certainly didn't make the functioning of Congress more effective. He doesn't have anything to show for those kinds of tactics other than a selfish desire to make himself look better among his group of supporters.\nHe's not the only Republican who is promising to extend those tactics in the Congress, and the country is not well served by it. President Obama is hopeful that the country will choose to elect Democrats who are actually interested in trying to advance the cause of democracy, who are trying to build on the progress that we've made over the last eight years, and are committed to trying to find common ground with President Clinton, if she's elected, to strengthen our economy, advance our interests around the world, fight climate change, and implement policies that ensure that our country and our criminal justice system is more fair and more just to every American.\nThose are the kinds of values that President Obama has been fighting for, for the last years. Those are the kinds of values that Secretary Clinton has built her campaign on. And those are the kinds of values that the President is hopeful will be represented in the majorities in Congress next year.\nQ: And last question. On a lighter note, did President Obama talk to Hillary Clinton on her birthday yesterday? And is he sending a gift of any kind with the First Lady today when she campaigns in North Carolina?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know if they spoke yesterday, and I'm not aware of any gift. But I know that the public event with the First Lady is not until later this afternoon, so we may all just have to tune in to find out.\nMichelle.\nQ: The new poll numbers that just came out this morning showing that the President's approval rating is still strong, and also that more than at any point during his presidency more Americans feel like things are going well in this country. So does the President pay attention to those numbers? And if so, what is his reaction to them?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the President is always gratified to get that kind of positive feedback in the form of polls or other source of public affirmation. But the President has never made important decisions about running the country based on what the polls say. The President has been focused on trying to do what he believes is the right thing, and he's been willing to make those decisions even if he thinks that the short-term political impact is not positive. He's always been focused on the long term.\nAnd I think a lot of the difficult decisions that he made early in his presidency that weren't politically popular -- things like reforming the health care system, rescuing the auto industry, engaging Iran through diplomacy to convince them to give up their nuclear weapons, to work with the international community to fight climate change -- those were all things that, when first announced didn't poll off the charts. But now, over the long term, that we have been able to demonstrate the wisdom of pursuing those approaches and to demonstrate the way the country has benefitted from those strategic decisions, that has had a positive impact on the public's consideration of President Obama's tenure in office. And that's obviously gratifying.\nQ: One new poll now shows Donald Trump with a very slight lead over Hillary Clinton in Florida, and it's within the margin of error. But as he's going to Florida tomorrow, knowing how close it is, does he change his message in any way, I guess, particularly tailored to Florida? What is he going to try to get across there?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't think the President's message changes all that much. I think he'll make a very forceful case in support of Secretary Clinton and talk about her commitment that she's demonstrated over a three-decade career in public service to bring people together to advance our values. She's somebody who's been focused on doing the right thing for our kids, doing the right thing for middle-class families. And the common ground here is, President Obama has been trying to do the right thing as President, and he's looking for somebody to succeed him who shares a commitment to those values and those priorities. And that's the message that he'll deliver.\nI also expect that he'll spend some time talking about the Democrat candidate for the Senate there, as well, who also shares a commitment to those kinds of values. And it is a close race in Florida, and that's why the President is going back tomorrow. I also suspect it's not the last time that President Obama will visit Florida before the election.\nQ: It seems like every time we've seen him out on the trail he's either stepped up what he said, or he's been more energetic each time. Can we expect something a little different tomorrow, especially given how close it is? I mean, is he going to surprise us in any way?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess he definitely won't surprise you if I tell you about it now.\nQ: We could be ready. We could be readier. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think the President is feeling very enthusiastic and optimistic both about Secretary Clinton's campaign, about the campaign of Democrats up and down the ballot all across the country, and about the trajectory of the race. But he's not taking anything for granted. He certainly is going to do everything he can to warn against the perils of complacency.\nAnd the outcome of this election is obviously important to him. He feels that so many of the things that he has poured his blood, sweat and tears into over the last eight years are at stake. And he's hopeful that he'll be able to hand over the keys to the Oval Office to someone who will build on that progress.\nQ: You mentioned the Senate race there. That's been called close. It's been called razor-thin margin just over the past week. But now we're seeing Rubio pull out ahead, according to, again, the latest polls. But right around this time, we see the DSCC move money from that race to elsewhere. Does the President feel like the DSCC is doing everything it can to pour support into that crucial race?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, the DSCC is going to have to make their own decisions about their budget. And they're obviously looking at a variety of races across the country, so I'd refer you to them to talk about their strategy. President Obama believes strongly about how important it is for the people of Florida to elect Congressman Murphy to represent them in the Senate. And that's something that President Obama has expressed himself on previous visits to Florida, and it's something that he expressed as early as back in June, I believe, when he initially announced his endorsement of Congressman Murphy. He was one of the first Senate candidates that President Obama did announce his public support for. And that, I think, should indicate the depth of President Obama's feeling about the outcome of this race.\nI think, having worked in Florida politics myself a decade or so ago, it's not unusual for there to be some twists and turns in the poll numbers, even in the last couple of weeks of an election. That is a state that is historically been the site of intense competition between Democrats and Republicans for statewide offices, and I'm not surprised to hear that that's the case this time, too.\nQ: Okay. And just quickly on this Erdogan call. I mean, the extradition request wasn't mentioned in the readout. I mean, does that mean that it wasn't brought up in this setting?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know whether or not it came up in the context of this particular call. If it did, I am confident in telling you it was not at all a focus of their conversation.\nI think as we've previously disclosed, it was the focus of a conversation that President Obama had with President Erdogan last month in China. And in the context of that conversation, President Obama reiterated the commitment of this administration and the Department of Justice to coordinate with the Turkish government as they present evidence that would support their request for extradition. But President Obama has been just as serious about indicating that this is a process that must follow the outlines of the extradition treaty between the United States and Turkey, but also must be consistent with the laws that are on the books here in the United States.\nQ: It wasn't that long ago that we heard Erdogan using language that made it seem like almost an ultimatum, like that the U.S. could choose between extraditing Gulen or having a relationship with Turkey. Based on this conversation yesterday and other high-level conversations about this subject that have been going on, would you say that Turkey is being as adamant about that extradition as it was in the last several weeks, or would you say that that has kind calmed down and that they are also understanding of the process?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I did not listen in to the President's phone call with President Erdogan yesterday, but I'd refer you to the Turkish government. What I can tell you is, I'm not aware that anybody in the U.S. government has detected a lessening of the intensity or the priority that the Turkish government places on this issue, but President Obama has been clear, time and time again, that this is an extradition request that will be processed consistent with the longstanding treaty between our two countries and consistent with the rule of law here in the United States.\nChris.\nQ: Josh, LGBT groups led by the National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce are calling on the President to take action on behalf of LGBT-owned businesses. The request -- it seeks an executive order or a presidential memorandum with two components. One is two prohibit discrimination in government contracting based on whether or not the business owner is LGBT, not just the workers, as the President has taken action with before. And the other component is to set goals to affirmatively include LGBT-owned small businesses and contracting. Would the President be open to taking that action in his final days in office?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Chris, I don't have any executive actions or executive order to preview for you. but obviously the President has taken executive action to ensure that companies that have contracts with the U.S. government are not discriminating against their employees because they're gay, and the President doesn't believe anybody should discriminate against business owners because they're gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender.\nThat's a principle that the President has long prioritized. But I can't tell you at this point whether or not that's something that would be the subject of an executive order.\nQ: Well, let's assume that the President would want to act of this in his final days in office. Is there enough time for that to happen, logistically? Or does it have to wait until the next administration?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess what I would say is it's not something I would rule out at this point, but I don't know whether or not something like that is in the works.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. What can you tell me about the White House's knowledge of the Syrian air strike that seems to have impacted the lives of at least more than a dozen, perhaps as many as two dozen children?\nMR. EARNEST: Kevin, this is just the latest example of the outrageous conduct of either the Assad regime or the Russian government. We know that there was a school in Syria that was hit in an airstrike. There is no justification for bombing a school. The early indication is that there were a couple of dozen students who were killed in the attack. And it is an outrage. And it is an indication that the Assad regime, supported by the Russians, is plumbing the depths of dishonorable conduct -- immoral conduct -- in trying to win a civil war. And it is -- at some point, the words to describe the sense of outrage are hard to find.\nBut make no mistake, we know that this school was hit in an airstrike. We don't know yet whether or not it was the Assad regime or the Russians that carried out the airstrike, but we know it was one of the two. And even if it was the Assad regime that carried it out, the Assad regime is only in a position to carry out those kinds of attacks because they are supported by the Russian government. And the failure of the Russian government to use their influence with the Assad regime to bring that kind of violence to an end is something that we have been deeply, deeply disappointed by.\nAnd obviously UNICEF, the U.N. agency, is taking a look at the situation, trying to investigate what exactly happened, but it is an appalling display of violence in a country that has suffered far too much in the last several years.\nQ: Staying abroad and speaking of the suffering, the people in Venezuela right now are in the throes of a devastating economic downturn, to say the least. What, if anything, can the United States do to support the people, if not the government? Because the government obviously has an adversarial relationship. Are we looking at a humanitarian crisis where they are the refugees, if you will, of this hemisphere?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, it is true that the situation on the ground in Venezuela is troubling, both because there is some concern about the political situation there that's been pretty well-documented, but it's also had a terrible impact on the daily lives of the Venezuelan people -- that there are a shortage of basic supplies, that access to medical care has been severely constrained, and this has put pressure not just on Venezuela but on some surrounding countries.\nSo we continue to be concerned about the situation in Venezuela, and we continue to urge the Venezuelan government and the Venezuelan people to resolve their differences through negotiation, without resorting to violence, so that some stability can be restored to the country and the government can return to a situation where it's functioning effectively, where the economy is strengthened, and where the needs of the Venezuelan people are being met. And that's not the situation right now, and it's something the United States government is concerned about.\nQ: Domestically, you and I have gone back and forth a bit about the Affordable Care Act and some of the numbers from state to state, the increases in particular. This afternoon -- I know you don't want to get ahead of it in terms of the messaging -- but can you give us sort of a preview, a readout of what we should expect from the President? Secretary Burwell, who seems to have this sense that things are going pretty well, when in fact, at least publicly, a lot of people feel like, at least for some of them, it certainly is not.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, I do think you can expect the President to make an energetic case to the thousands of people who will be on the phone with him later today that the work that they're doing to educate the American people about the opportunities available to them at healthcare.gov is critically important.\nBecause of the Affordable Care Act, and since it went into effect, 20 million Americans have gotten access to health care. The growth in health care costs is certainly much lower than it was before the Affordable Care Act went into effect. We heard a lot of promises from Republicans that the Affordable Care Act would be a job killer. But the truth is, every month since President Obama signed that bill into law six years ago, our economy has created jobs.\nSo, in spite of the politically motivated attacks against the Affordable Care Act that have been launched by Republicans, the American people are benefitting from the law. And they would benefit even more from the law if Republicans would finally decide to do something other than just score political points. If they're willing to work with the administration and to implement some reforms, like the ones the President has outlined, we could ensure that the Affordable Care Act was working even more effectively than it already is and enhance the benefits that the American people are already enjoying from the law.\nQ: Do you acknowledge then that, at least for some middle class families -- you talked a bit about tax credits, which sounds terrific in the outward months, but in the immediacy of needing health care, a tax benefit doesn't really help you if you have to write that check immediately. Can you understand why some families feel like tax credits are great, but in the immediate term, it's certainly still more expensive for many of us?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what I can tell you is we can get you an update and a briefing on how the process of those payments are made, but those payments are made in a way that allow people to enjoy the saving without having to wait until the end of the year.\nQ: Okay. So just a couple more. Gitmo -- is it your understanding that within the next week or so, we're going to have more transfers to announce?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't gotten an updated briefing in terms of what sort of transfers could be in the pipeline, but if there are any transfers that are planned, we'll let you know as soon as -- our procedure has typically been to announce those transfers once the individual has been transferred to the custody of another country. There obviously is congressional notification process that precedes that public notification, but when that transfer has been made, we'll be sure to let you know.\nQ: We're at 60 now. Is that your number?\nMR. EARNEST: That's my understanding of the last number, yes.\nQ: Okay, got you. Last -- is the President planning on going to New Hampshire, perhaps, given the closeness of the race up there, at least for the Senate?\nMR. EARNEST: I wouldn't rule it out. But we'll have more details on the President's campaign travel schedule in the next couple of days.\nChip.\nQ: Josh, thanks. On the Affordable Care Act, I think the number is about 40 percent of the people who are eligible for coverage under the Affordable Care Act but who remain uninsured are between the ages of 18 and 34. Why are you having so much trouble getting millennials to sign up? And are you doing anything different this time around to try to convince them to sign up?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Chip, we certainly are going to redouble our efforts to make sure that young Americans across the country are aware of the benefits that are available to them at healthcare.gov. And the reason for that is twofold. The first is, those young Americans, if they are not signed up for health care, they're cutting a check to the U.S. government for $700 at the end of the year. They're paying a $700 penalty for not signing up for health care. That's not a particularly judicious use of funds.\nQ: Should it be higher? They're not responding to it.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think what we're going to do is make sure that people are educated about the circumstances -- both that they're aware of the fine that they will have to pay if they don't sign up for health care, but also making sure that they're aware of the quality, affordable plans that are available to them at healthcare.gov, and that many of them will be -- and will qualify for economic assistance from the U.S. government in the form of tax credits that will make those health care options even more affordable than it might appear originally.\nIt's fair to say that we intend to redouble our efforts, that we're going to look for new and creative ways to try to make this case to young people, in particular, that they should sign up. Another reason for that is we know that those young people tend to be healthier than the general population, and so the more young people that sign up through the marketplace -- the risk pool will be improved. And that actually will put downward pressure on premiums for everybody, not just those young people.\nQ: So it sounds like you're saying it's their fault because they're uninformed. They don't understand that it would be better for them not to pay this penalty and to join. They don't understand that they get these tax credits. Is it just about messaging and education, or do you need to make changes?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, to be clear, I'm not blaming them. I think the U.S. government takes responsibility for making sure that they have the tools that they need and the knowledge that they need to make smart choices. And so we certainly are going to act consistent with that imperative to make sure that we're getting the word out. But I think that it is not a tough case to make, I guess is what I would say, because when faced with the choice of either paying a $700 penalty at the end of the year or being able to purchase health care for 75 bucks a month, it seems like a pretty clear choice.\nRon.\nQ: Do you know how many people paid the penalty?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't. But you should check with the IRS -- they may be able to give you some statistics about that.\nQ: And I think Chip was saying that most people who are penalized don't pay, or there's a significant -- is there a gap? What is the rate of responsiveness? The point is, are there lot of people who are delinquent for not paying that penalty?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't think so, because it's part of the tax collection process. When you fill out your tax form, you have to indicate whether or not you had health care the previous year. And if you don't check the right box, then a $700 charge is added.\nQ: What about the email and leaks about Bill Clinton Inc.? What's the President's reaction to all that? Is he aware of it?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm sure he is, because it was on the front page of a couple of newspapers today. But I didn't talk to him about it.\nQ: Is there a concern at the White House that all this plays into this narrative that's out there by the Republicans that Secretary Clinton is in some ways -- well, to use Donald Trump's words, corrupt, and that there's this blurring of lines between the foundation and the family's personal finances?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I think for questions about the personal finances of the Clinton family and the operation of the foundation, you should go check with Secretary Clinton's team. What President Obama can speak to, and has spoken to in the past and will speak to in the future, is the remarkable service that she devoted to the American people when she served as Secretary of State. And I know that Republicans have often falsely tried to besmirch her service to this country as Secretary of State. But President Obama can speak firsthand to the professionalism and expertise and dedication that she brought to that job. The American people and our interests around the world were advanced because of her fine public service.\nQ: Is there any concern at the White House, you think, that should she become President that all this will trail her into the White House and could possibly hinder her as a future leader of this country?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think this is what Republicans are promising, even in advance of the election. I saw comments from Congressman Chaffetz -- he of the Gmail account business cards -- vowing to engage in congressional investigations that actually don't have anything to do with the Clinton White House. He's already saying they've got two years of material built up based on her tenure as Secretary of State.\nQ: What's your reaction?\nMR. EARNEST: My reaction to that is that that's the same strategy that Darrell Issa tried to pursue when he served -- when he preceded Congressman Chaffetz in that role, and it did not benefit Mr. Issa's personal political prospects. He now has been faced with a scenario where he went from calling the President one of the most corrupt Presidents in history to now featuring President Obama prominently on a mailer in support of his campaign. So he looks pretty ridiculous. And Mr. Chaffetz seems to be well down the same path.\nQ: And just one last thing on the Russian -- the allegation against the Russians of trying to influence the election. Does all the Podesta alleged emails that have been leaked, does that --\nMR. EARNEST: Stolen and leaked.\nQ: Does that fall under the category -- as the U.S. assesses its proportional response to what they have done -- in other words, we're not just talking about the Russians allegedly trying to adjust or in some way affect the balloting process in states. This alleged dumping of information is part of the crime, if you will, that they've committed, and that will figure in the response by the administration.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what the intelligence community and the Department of Homeland Security have concluded is that there has been an effort undertaken by the Russians to try to raise doubts or to cast doubt on the integrity of our political process by stealing all this information and looking for ways to make it public. And that's a conclusion that they've reached, and it's something that is a source of serious concern here in the administration. And the President and his national security team are considering what sort of steps should be part of a proportional response.\nQ: Is it still your position that there may not be -- and I think you said there won't be -- any acknowledgement publicly of when this happens?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any update in terms of a public discussion of our response.\nQ: So, again, so where are we, is the point. Are we at the point where --\nMR. EARNEST: We're at the point where the President and his team are still discussing what a proportional response would be and what would be included as part of it.\nQ: And you're not -- are we also still at the point where you said that this will happen and we won't know about it? Or is it still being determined whether there will be some public revelation about what has happened?\nMR. EARNEST: I have been intentionally vague about the timeline.\nJared.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Yesterday, and then today again to Kevin, you emphasized Republican leaders around states as being an impediment to the efficient implementation of the Affordable Care Act. But if we compare the estimate premiums for many ACA marketplace plans as CBO estimated from 2009 to what they're now estimating for 2017, we're actually on track for what those original estimates would have been. And so I wonder -- I know we're less than two weeks out from an election, but are you for political reasons emphasizing that Republicans are the main problem here? Should we be talking about the way that private insurance companies have low-balled their initial premiums and now are coming back, and that's part of the reason for the spike? Or is this politics at this point?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Jared, you ask a good question, because there are obviously a lot of factors that have an influence on this process, particularly when you consider that there are some states where the spikes, as you've described them, have been prominent. There have been other states where costs have gone down. And is that a result of some of the pricing strategies that have been pursued by private insurance companies? That could certainly be part of it.\nBut there is one thing that we do know, which is that insurance premiums are higher, about 7 percent higher, in states where Republicans blocked the expansion of Medicaid. So I used the example of Oklahoma yesterday. And this really does raise questions: Why would Republicans in Oklahoma prevent citizens in their state from getting access to health care that at least for the first three years is paid entirely by the federal government?\nQ: But are you reluctant to criticize private insurers because they're the partners here? Or is it better politics to criticize Republican lawmakers around the country? I'm just -- why the focus? It seems like, again, yesterday it was just about these lawmakers. I haven't heard a lot from the podium about the way in which these are essentially on trend for what CBO was originally expecting.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think what I acknowledged yesterday is that the Affordable Care Act is a set of reforms that are imposed on the private health insurance system. And that means that there are going to be many decisions, including pricing decisions, made by private insurance companies. And they're all going to have to develop their own strategy for putting forward plans that are competitive. Our reforms ensure that those are plans that meet a minimum level of benefits, and that those are plans that can be made more affordable by offering tax credits. Those are reforms that benefit taxpayers and benefit customers, both because it reduces the deficit and because it makes quality health insurance available to every single American.\nQ: On a separate topic then. While the President is in Germany and Greece, I know that you don't have all the details for this trip yet, but will he be meeting with refugees? I know that's a part of the mission to both of these countries. Will there be an event where the President has face time with people who are in these communities or have traveled and are either internally displaced or displaced outside of their home country?\nMR. EARNEST: At this point, Jared, I don't know whether or not the President will meet with refugees. You may recall that when the President traveled to Malaysia at the end of last year he had an opportunity to visit a nonprofit in Kuala Lumpur that was providing for the basic needs of people who had fled to Malaysia from other countries around the world. Many of the people that he met with were actually refugees who were in Malaysia who had been approved to move to the United States. And as somebody who had the benefit of witnessing that event, it was a really powerful experience.\nSo if there's time on the President's schedule for him to meet with refugees who have fled to Europe then I'm sure he would be pleased to have the opportunity to do so.\nLesley.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I wanted to go back to the First Lady who is campaigning today with the Secretary of State. A lot has been made about the remarks that she made against Donald Trump's remarks on the \"Access Hollywood\" tapes. And I wanted to get your response to some who have suggested hypocrisy in that they noted that she's been a fan of various entertainers, and that the White House has had various entertainers here who have used similarly crude language in some of their lyrics.\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't heard those questions raised. I think it's pretty clear from the First Lady's comments that she was speaking from the heart. And, yes, she was talking about a political campaign, she was appearing at a political event, and her remarks were covered by political reporters, but I think at the end of the day, she gave a personal speech that resonated with the experience of women all across the country. And I thought that was a powerful moment during the campaign, and I think it's the kind of speech that people will remember for a long time.\nIt's not surprising to me that maybe people who are seeking to criticize that speech for political reasons -- they're certainly entitled to do that -- but I think at the end of the day the First Lady was speaking from the heart.\nQ: But has she called out, like, various lyrics from various performers? Or has that been a concern -- about the tone in some who have been here?\nMR. EARNEST: I probably don't follow all of the First Lady's public comments as carefully as I should, so you could probably check with her office to see if she's commented on these kinds of issues before. But I don't think there's any question that the kinds of values that she was standing up for in the context of the speech that she delivered a couple of weeks ago, are the kinds of values that are deeply held and are consistent with the values that she and the President have been seeking to advance for their eight years here in the White House.\nScott.\nQ: Josh, is the President and Samantha Bee -- is it going to be more about ACA, or is it more November election or --\nMR. EARNEST: So, unfortunately, Scott, Samantha Bee will not be coming to the White House. The President taped an interview with her while they were on the road -- I believe it was last week, while they were in Florida. I think most of that conversation did focus on the upcoming presidential campaign, but you can tune in Monday to find out.\nQ: And what's you all's thinking about the audience that you're trying to get there?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously she is somebody who has cultivated a strong and loyal following among young people. And much of her commentary is political in nature, so this is a politically engaged audience, and the President was hoping to use this opportunity to underscore how important he thinks it is for young adults to be engaged in the political process and to participate in the upcoming campaign.\nBob.\nQ: Josh, maybe I'm the only one in the room who needs a refresher course, but regarding the --\nMR. EARNEST: Probably not.\nQ: -- Affordable Care Act, what reforms does the President want to see in it? And do they hold up in light of these higher premium -- the issue of the higher premiums that we're seeing this particular year?\nMR. EARNEST: Bob, what we should do is get you a copy of the speech that the President delivered in Florida a week or two ago on this topic. But I'll outline them shortly for you.\nThe first is that the President does believe that there are some communities across the country where there isn't as much competition as we would like to see, and the President believes that consumers in those communities would benefit from having a public option to choose from. That doesn't mean it should be a nationwide public option, but rather should be an option for people in those communities where there is not already a lot of built-in competition. This tends to be rural communities, less affluent communities.\nThe President has also suggested that there could be a benefit to enhancing the tax credits that are available to young adults. The idea here would be that by giving them a greater financial incentive to sign up for the Affordable Care Act, more young adults would sign up. And if more young adults sign up to participate in these risk pools that brings down costs for everybody.\nThe other proposal has actually been to expand eligibility for tax credits to give more middle-class families access to greater tax credits to make health care even more affordable. There is something that economists will often describe as a slope -- they sort of phase out tax credits as you get closer to the 400 percent threshold, and they do that because creating a cliff would be bad policy; that if you make one dollar less than the threshold, you get all the benefit and if you make one dollar more you get none of the benefit. So the question is, do you adjust the slope so that more people can get access to more tax credits? And that could potentially lead more people to choose to sign up.\nThe other thing that is important for people not to overlook is that written into the Affordable Care Act are some reform opportunities that are already available to state governments. Written into the Affordable Care Act that was signed into law back in 2010 are provisions that allow the Department of Health and Human Services to grant waivers to states who come forward with their own ideas and their plans for holding down the growth in health care costs and expanding eligibility to people in their states.\nAnd we certainly would hope that there would be more states out there who would take advantage of that built-in flexibility to come to the Obama administration and say, here are some things that we can do in our state, given the unique makeup of our state, given the unique economy in our state, given the unique composition of the population in our state, these are some things that we could do that would be even smarter, that would do even more to hold down the growth and get more people to sign up. And that's something that the Department of Health and Human Services would carefully consider, and we have an interest in working with states to do that.\nBut those are some of the ideas that the President has put forward, but we can get you a copy of the speech so you can see it in more detail.\nJC.\nQ: Are we missing the boat when it comes to youth, young people, students? Needless to say, the Affordable Care Act would be a lot more effective if the younger people did understand their -- or could comprehend their invulnerability. In other words, at some point, we all get sick. But when you're young, you don't think you ever will. And also, Hillary is trying to bring the youth back from -- ironically, from an older guy, Bernie Sanders. Are we missing the ability to connect, or are they not paying attention?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think there's a danger in generalizing. I think what is true is that the U.S. government, particularly when it comes to the Affordable Care Act, could do a more effective job in communicating with young adults across the country about the kinds of opportunities that are available to them at healthcare.gov. And we certainly are looking for ways that we can refine and improve our ability to make that case.\nWhen it comes to engagement in the political system more broadly, the President believes that the country benefits when more people are engaged. I guess that's a longer way of using the slogan that Secretary Clinton has adopted -- it sounds like they may have a similar approach here. But regardless of who you're supporting in the election and regardless of which candidate you're supporting, the President believes that the country is better off if everybody is engaged.\nAnd part of the reason for that is that we do so see -- frankly, on both sides of the aisle -- more engagement, louder voices, more energy at the extremes. And that if there were more people in the middle who spoke up and were engaged, the country would benefit from that, and would benefit from that moderating influence.\nAnd so we'll see if that happens in the context of this election. Sometimes that's hard to do when the electoral environment is already so crowded and noisy, it's hard to make space for people in the middle, but the President believes that's a worthy pursuit. And I think you've heard Secretary Clinton try to do that a little bit, too, in terms of pursuing an approach that's consistent with what the President has advocated, which is basically saying that, regardless of the outcome of this election, I'm going to be President for everybody. That's certainly what President Obama has tried to do as President. And that approach is one of the other reasons that he's supportive of Secretary Clinton, as he himself has said.\nBut, look, at the end of the day, greater civic engagement on the part of everybody, regardless of who they're voting for, is something that would be good for the country.\nVictoria, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Twelve days out from the election, what level of confidence does the White House have with the cyber systems of the states, now that the Department of Homeland Security has done its review of them and has sort of scoured them? And also, how many states ultimately did take advantage of that?\nMR. EARNEST: Victoria, the Department of Homeland Security retains a lot of expertise and offered to provide extensive assistance to elections administrators all across the country to ensure that they were protected from cyber intrusions that could interfere with their ability to conduct an election.\nThe response has actually been quite good. The vast majority of states have been in touch with the Department of Homeland Security and have effectively coordinated with them to ensure the safety and security of the systems that individual states themselves administer. That should build a lot of confidence in the ability of states and localities across the country to conduct an election that is free and fair and accurately reflects the preferences expressed by those who show up to the polls on Election Day.\nThanks, everybody.\nEND 1:42 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2016-10-27", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}
{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "note": "Remarks as delivered.  Following Secretary Clinton's remarks, Michelle Obama spoke about the importance of the election and emphasized that every vote matters.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119694", "text": "Hello, Winston-Salem! Hello Wake Forest! It is so great to be here in this beautiful city at this extraordinary time and to have a chance to be with so many, including the Wake Forest family. And it doesn't get any better than being here with our most amazing First Lady Michelle Obama. I want to thank everyone who has filled this arena, and I especially want to thank Dr. Hatch and the staff team and students at Wake Forest University. I will never forget being here with the legendary Maya Angelou, one of the most powerful voices our country has ever heard.\nSo I couldn't think of a better place to come back to with another woman whose voice we need now more than ever. I want to say what I think is obvious but can't be said enough, and that is this may be one of the most, if not the most important election of our lifetimes, no matter our age. But for young people it will be so consequential because every election is about the future. And this one is about whether we build on the progress we've made, the legacy that President Obama has built or rip it away and go backwards. So we have a lot of work to do.\nAnd I don't mean just in the presidential race. Let's be sure to elect Roy Cooper, the next governor of North Carolina. He will always put the people of North Carolina first. And he will repeal HB2 – because he knows that discrimination is wrong. It's bad for business, and it's against North Carolina's values.\nAnd let's send Deborah Ross to the United States Senate. She will be an independent voice for the working families in this state, and she will help break through the gridlock in Washington.\nAnd unlike her opponent, Deborah Ross has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump. And remember, it is not just Roy's name and Deborah's name or my name that's going to be on the ballot. So much of what we care about -- so much that's at stake in the election is, too.\nVoting rights are at stake. And if you care about this sacred right, and want to make sure our leaders of both parties do their part to protect and strengthen it -- not chip away at it, you've got to vote in this election. And so I hope, after all North Carolina has gone through with the efforts to suppress people's votes, you will turn out and say, \"No. We demand the right to vote.\"\nAnd supporting our veterans is at stake. If you believe that America should stand with those who served because they served us, then you've got to vote. And so when you think about yourselves, your families, people you know who've worn the uniform of our country, the best way to make clear that we respect the military, and we will do everything we can to make sure they and their families have what they need as they sacrificed for us, is to show up and vote.\nAnd climate change is at stake. Now, I shouldn't have to say this in 2016, but I will. If you believe in science, right? And you know that climate change is real and demands action right now – you've got to show up and vote in this election.\nImmigration is at stake. If you believe that we need to fix our broken system, keep families together, and give people who love America a path to citizenship – you've got to vote.\nAnd marriage equality is at stake, too. If you believe everyone deserves to be treated equally in America, no matter who they are or who they love – then you've got to turn out and vote in this election.\nGood jobs that pay good wages are at stake. Investing in our roads and our bridges and our water systems and all the work that needs to be done in our country. That really matters, and we can put millions of people to work and have a more competitive economy. That's why we've proposed a very big jobs program, because I don't want anybody willing to work in this country not to have a good job with a rising income to support themselves and their families. If you believe that, then you've got to come out and vote.\nAnd particularly, for all of the students here, affordable college education is at stake. And not only that, relief from student debt that you already have is at stake. So if you believe as we do that everyone should be able to afford to go to college and graduate and that everyone should be able to pay down and pay off their debt, then you've got to get out and vote in this election.\nAnd dignity for women and girls. Again, I wish I didn't have to say this, right? But indeed, dignity and respect for women and girls is also on the ballot in this election. And I want to thank our First Lady for her eloquent, powerful defense of that basic value. So I think you're getting the idea here that I think everything we care about is at stake in this election. So you've got to vote – and get your friends and families and neighbors to vote too.\nAnd don't just take it from me because I think you've heard some really compelling voices say the same thing, and one of them is here with us today, right? There are so many things I admire about our First Lady. Michelle reminds us to work hard, stay true to our values, be good to one another and never, ever stop fighting for what we believe in.\nShe has spent eight years as our First Lady advocating for girls around the world to go to school and have the same opportunities as boys. She has worked for healthier childhoods for our kids here at home, better nutrition, more exercise. And we are seeing the results. We actually are seeing kids who are healthier, something that she was determined to try to achieve. She has encouraged more young people to go to college and follow your dreams, and she has supported America's military families, who serve and sacrifice as well for our country.\nNow, it hasn't been all hard work. She played a mean round of 'Carpool Karaoke,' and among the many real privileges I've had is to see the President and the First Lady dance. Wow, one could only hope. Now, she also planted an amazing vegetable garden at the White House – and I can promise you, if I win, I will take good care of it, Michelle.\nAnd boy – thank you! Boy, didn't she dazzle the world with that wise and beautiful speech at the Democratic National Convention this summer?\nAnd I have now, I have now stood on the debate stage for four and a half hours with Donald Trump, and if you see any of those debates, well, that has proved once and for all that I have the stamina to be President and Commander in Chief. But there were times during those three debates, the loop running in my head was what Michelle said at the convention, right? 'When they go low, we go high.'\nAnd on top of all that, just by being herself every day, never missing an opportunity to honor her parents for the hard work and sacrifice that set her on her way, she has shown every little girl and boy in America that there are no limits to what they can achieve if they work hard and do right and believe in themselves.\nSeriously – is there anyone more inspiring than Michelle Obama?\nAnd maybe, maybe it's especially meaningful to me because I do know something about being First Lady of the United States, and I'm going to state the obvious. It's not easy. You've got so many people counting on you. You've got the eyes of the world on you. And when you're trying to raise your children as she is and I did, and give them the space and support they need to have as normal and safe and fulfilling childhoods as possible – that makes it even harder. I used to hang out in the main hall on the second floor of the White House around the time Chelsea would come home from school just to be sure I got to see her and see what happened that day and try to figure out what I needed to be thinking about and doing for her.\nAnd let's be real – as our first African-American First Lady, she's faced pressures I never did. And she's handled them with pure grace. By any standard, she has been an outstanding First Lady who has made us all so proud.\nAnd she and the President, she and the President have been such wonderful friends to me and my family. It has just meant the world, the world to me, it really has.\nI want to say just one thing about the First Lady's work. I mentioned military families. She's been their fierce champion. And military families have come up against a lot in this election. It just made me boil when Donald Trump disrespected a Gold Star family, Mr. and Mrs. Khan. He still hasn't apologized to them.\nHe actually made it worse – just yesterday, he said again that if America had only made him President years ago, their son, Captain Khan, would still be alive. Honestly, I don't -- I don't understand how anyone would want to rub salt in the wounds of a grieving family.\nAnd he keeps insulting our military. Yesterday, when he heard that a retired Army colonel and former dean of the Army War College said that Donald doesn't understand military strategy, Trump said, 'I'll teach him a couple things.' Well actually, Donald, you're the one who's got a lot to learn about the military and everything else that makes America great. Starting by learning about the dignity and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform and their families. And he should learn from Michelle Obama how a leader supports them, not disrespects them!\nNo one knows the stakes in this election better than our First Lady. Because all the progress that we've achieved under President Obama's leadership is at stake – he pulled our economy out of the biggest ditch that it was in when he became president. He saved the auto industry, he cracked down on Wall Street, he has tackled healthcare, climate change, civil rights, and so much else.\nAnd all the work that we've done to strengthen our relationships with other countries and secure our leadership in the world is also at stake.\nNow, I for one, and I hope all of you, do not want all that hard work – by our President and our First Lady and by millions of Americans – to be wiped away. We cannot let that happen.\nWe've got to do everything in our power to get everyone out to vote. To understand no matter what issue you care about, it truly is on the ballot. Now, this has been a hard election at times. It's gotten pretty ugly, hasn't it? We've all felt it – especially our kids.\nI hear this from parents and children across our country – kids write me notes, they hand me little cards and notes when I shake hands with them. Their parents write to me, teachers talk to me. Kids are scared, kids are scared by the rhetoric they're hearing, right? I see the educators' heads nodding.\nLittle girls hear the ugly things that have been said about women in this campaign, and it makes them feel terrible and doubt themselves – and that is why it is important for voices, like our First Lady's, to stand up and say, 'Wait a minute, respecting women and girls is so important,' and it is especially important for us to send that message to our children, boys and girls alike.\nOur kids are scared that they're going to be sent out of the country because their parents are immigrants or they're immigrants. They're scared if they're Muslim, or have a disability. I got a letter from a parent -- a mom from Wisconsin, I think, who adopted her son Felix from Ethiopia when he was a toddler. He just turned 11 years old – he wrote my campaign to let me know he was now 11 years old. I love it when little kids do little birthday remembrances. America is the only country he's ever known. One day, he turned to his mom and asked, 'If Donald Trump becomes President, is he going to make me go back to Ethiopia?'\nNow that honestly breaks my heart. We've got to make sure all our kids know that America has a place for you -- the American Dream is big enough for you. And then, we've got to make sure they learn the right lessons about how to treat people. I saw that sign, I believe in love and kindness, right?\nWell, here's one place to start. We know that bullying is a real problem in our classrooms, our playgrounds and online – and teachers have reported that this election has made it worse. So I want you to know, we're going to launch a major new effort to help states and communities and schools and families end bullying wherever it takes places. And we will work together to make the internet a safer space for kids, invest in front-line professionals like guidance counselors and social workers and school nurses and psychologists to support kids who've been targeted, like the young woman I met in Iowa who told me she was bullied because of her asthma. This has got to stop. And I can't think of anything more important than making sure every single one of our kids knows that they loved just as they are.\nSo ultimately, my friends, as Michelle reminded us this election is about our kids, and in my case, my grandkids. Their lives and their futures -- nothing is more important to me than that. I've been fighting for kids throughout my career. I will fight for them every single day of my presidency. So we have a job to do.\nStarting right now, let's come together. Let's work together. And let's be hopeful and optimistic and unified in the face of division and hate. Bring people together in a spirit of mutual respect to solve shared challenges. Let's have each other's backs, lift each other up, not tear each other down.\nLet's go out and win this election to make sure we do exactly that – for Roy Cooper, Deborah Ross, and all of us. Let's make sure you vote early. Vote as soon as you can, vote this afternoon. I'm excited about what we're going to see happen here in North Carolina, and I am so excited to be introducing our amazing First Lady Michelle Obama!", "timestamp": "2016-10-27", "title": "Remarks at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina"}
{"author": "Michelle Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=120928", "text": "MRS. OBAMA: Well, hey there! (Applause.) You guys are pretty fired up, right? (Applause.) I like that. I like that. (Applause.) Wow.\nWell, let me start, of course, because Hillary's mini tribute to me was -- it's taken me off of -- it's kind of thrown me a little bit. It was very generous. But I just want to take this moment publicly to thank Hillary. I mean, there -- it takes a level of generosity of spirit to do what Hillary has done in her career, in her life for our family, for this nation. (Applause.) And if people wonder, yes, Hillary Clinton is my friend. She has been a friend to me and Barack and Malia and Sasha, and Bill and Chelsea have been embracing and supportive from the very day my husband took the oath of office. (Applause.)\nSo I am grateful for Hillary -- for her leadership, for her courage, and for what she is going to do for this country. So it's going to be good. It's going to be good. (Applause.)\nBut I also want to take some time to recognize your former Senator, Kay Hagan, who is here. Kay, it's good to see you. (Applause.) And again, I just want to lend my voice to your outstanding Senate candidate, Deborah Ross. (Applause.) Man, Deborah -- as Hillary said, she's someone who cares deeply about the people in this state. And she is always going to put your families first. So let's make Deborah your next U.S. senator, all right? (Applause.) And let's make Roy Cooper your next governor, how about that? (Applause.)\nThanks also to all the members of Congress who are joining us, and your Mayor, Allen Joines. Thank you, Mayor. (Applause.)\nBut more importantly, thank you, to all of you, for taking the time, waiting in lines to be here today to help us support the next President and Vice President of the United States, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine! (Applause.) I don't know about you but I'm fired up. (Applause.) We're going to make this happen.\nNow, you may have noticed that I have been doing some campaigning for Hillary. (Laughter.) And I know that there are some folks out there who have commented that it's been unprecedented for a sitting First Lady to be so actively engaged in a presidential campaign. And that may be true, but what's also true is that this is truly an unprecedented election. And that's why I'm out here.\nI'm out here first and foremost because we have never had a more qualified and prepared candidate for President than our friend, Hillary Clinton -- never before in our lifetime. I say this everywhere I go -- I admire and respect Hillary. She has been a lawyer, a law professor, First Lady of Arkansas, First Lady of the United States, a U.S. Senator, Secretary of State. (Applause.)\nAUDIENCE: Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!\nMRS. OBAMA: Yeah, that's right. Hillary doesn't play. (Laughter.) She has more experience and exposure to the presidency than any candidate in our lifetime –- yes, more than Barack, more than Bill. So she is absolutely ready to be Commander-in-Chief on day one. And, yes, she happens to be a woman. (Applause.)\nThis election is also unprecedented because I don't think we've ever had two candidates with such dramatically different visions of who we are and how we move forward as a nation. One candidate has a vision that's grounded in hopelessness and despair; a vision of a country that is weak and divided, where our communities are in chaos, our fellow citizens a threat. This candidate calls on us to turn against each other, to build walls, to be afraid.\nAnd then there's Hillary's vision for this country that you just heard -- (applause) -- a vision of a nation that is powerful and vibrant and strong, big enough to have a place for all of us. A nation where we each have something very special to contribute, and where we are always stronger together. (Applause.)\nThat is the choice we face –- between those who divide this country into \"us\" versus \"them,\" and those who tell us to embrace our better angels and choose hope over fear. And as we look into the eyes of our children as we send them off to school each morning and tuck them into bed at night, as Hillary said, the stakes in this election could not be more clear. And let me tell you, this is not about Republicans versus Democrats. None of that matters this time around.\nNo, no, no, this election is about something much bigger. It's about who will shape our children and the country we leave for them, not just for the next four or eight years but for the rest of their lives. (Applause.) Because as Hillary pointed out, we all know -- we know the influence our President has on our children -- how they turn on the TV and they see the most powerful role model in the world, someone who shows them how to treat others, how to deal with disappointment, whether to tell the truth. They're taking it all in.\nAnd as Hillary said, when you've raised children in the White House, like Barack and Hillary and I have, you are reminded every day of the impact that you have. You start seeing the images of every child in this country in the face of your child. So when people wonder how Hillary keeps her composure through the overwhelming pressure of not just this campaign but of her career, or how Barack and I have dealt with the glare of the national spotlight these last eight years, that's the answer: With every action we take, with every word we utter, we think about the millions of children who are watching us who hang onto our every word, looking to us to show them who they can and should be.\nAnd that's why, every day, we try to be the kind of people, the kind of leaders that your children deserve, whether you agree with our politics or not. (Applause.) And when I think about this election, let me tell you, that is what I'm thinking about. I'm asking myself, what do my girls, what do all our children deserve in their President? What kind of a President do we want for them?\nWell, to start with, I think we want someone who is a unifying force in this country, someone who sees our differences not as a threat, but as a blessing. (Applause.) As Hillary said, we want a President who values and honors women, who teachers our daughters and our sons that women are full and equal human beings worthy, deserving of love and respect. (Applause.)\nWe want a President who understands that this nation was built by folks who came here from all corners of the globe -- folks who work their fingers to the bone to create this country and give their kids a better life. We want a President who sees the goodness in all our communities, not just the brokenness. Someone who understands that communities like the one where I was raised are filled with good, hard-working folks -– folks who take that extra shift, who work that extra job because they want something more for their kids. (Applause.)\nAnd finally, we want a President who takes this job seriously -- (applause) -- and has the temperament and maturity to do it well. (Applause.) Someone who is steady. Someone who we can trust with the nuclear codes, because we want to go to sleep at night knowing that our kids and our country are safe.\nAnd I am here today because I believe with all of my heart -- and I would not be here lying to you -- I believe with all of my heart that Hillary Clinton will be that President. (Applause.)\nSee, over the years, I've come to know Hillary. I know her -- not just her extraordinary professional accomplishments, but I know her personal values and beliefs. I know that Hillary was raised like Barack and I -- in a working family. Hillary's mother was an orphan, abandoned by her parents. Her father was a small-business owner who stayed up nights poring over the books, working hard to keep their family afloat.\nSo believe this, Hillary knows what it means to struggle for what you have and to want something better for your kids. See, and that's why, since the day she launched her campaign, Hillary has been laying out concrete, detailed policies that will actually make a difference for kids and families in this country.\nAs she said, she plans to make college tuition-free, to help young people drowning in debt. (Applause.) She is going to handle making sure that our climate is protected. (Applause.) And let me tell you this about Hillary -- she is involved and engaged in every policy issue that she's developed. You go on her website -- she's going to raise the minimum wage. She's going to cut taxes for working folks. (Applause.) She's going to do her best to help women get equal pay for equal work. (Applause.)\nAnd if you want to know more just go on her website: HillaryClinton.com. Because here's the thing about Hillary -- thankfully, Hillary is a policy wonk. And let me tell you, when you are President, that is a good thing. (Applause.) Because policies matter. They really matter. They determine whether our kids have good schools, whether they can see a doctor when they're sick, whether they're safe when they walk out door on their way to school.\nPolicies matter. And that's why Hillary has fought so hard for children's health insurance as First Lady, for affordable child care in the Senate. That's why, as Secretary of State, she has gone toe-to-toe with world leaders to keep our kids safe. And that is why day after day, debate after debate, she has shown us such strength, such grace, refusing to be knocked down, refusing to be pushed around or counted out.\nHillary does all of this because she is thinking of children like her mother, children like her daughter and her grandkids -– children who deserve every chance to fulfill their God-given potential. That is why Hillary is in this. She is in this for us. She's in this for our families, for our kids, for our shared future.\nSo let me tell you, that is why I am inspired by Hillary. That is why I respect Hillary -- because she has lived a life grounded in service and sacrifice that has brought her to this day, that has more than prepared her to take on the hardest job on the planet. She has run an extraordinary campaign. She has built an impressive grassroots organization. She's raised the money. She's won all the debates. (Applause.)\nSo Hillary has done her job. Now we need to do our job and get her elected President of the United States. (Applause.) Because here's where I want to get real: If Hillary doesn't win this election, that will be on us. It will be because we did not stand with her. It will be because we did not vote for her. And that is exactly what her opponent is hoping will happen. That's the strategy -– to make this election so dirty and ugly that we don't want any part of it.\nSo when you hear folks talking about a global conspiracy and saying that this election is \"rigged,\" understand that they are trying to get you to stay home. They are trying to convince you that your vote doesn't matter, that the outcome has already been determined and you shouldn't even bother to make your voice heard. They are trying to take away your hope.\nAnd just for the record, in this country, the United States of America, the voters decide our elections. They've always decided. Voters decide who wins and who loses. Period. End of story. (Applause.) And right now, thankfully, folks are coming out in droves to vote early. It's amazing to see. We are making our voices heard all across this country. Because when they go low --\nAUDIENCE: We go high! (Applause.)\nMRS. OBAMA: And we know that every vote matters. Every single vote. And if you have any doubt about that, consider this: Back in 2008 -- I say this everywhere I go -- Barack won North Carolina by about 14,000 votes -- (applause) -- which sounds like a lot. But when you break that number down, the difference between winning and losing this state was a little over two votes per precinct. See, I want you all to take that in, because I know that there are people here who didn't vote. Two votes. And people knew people who didn't vote. If just two or three folks per precinct had gone the other way, Barack would have lost that state, could have lost the election.\nAnd let's not forget, back in 2012, Barack actually did lose this state by about 17 votes per precinct. Seventeen. That's how presidential elections go. They are decided on a razor's edge. So each of you could swing, in this stadium -- just think about it -- each of you could swing an entire precinct and win this election for Hillary just by getting yourselves, your friends and your family out to vote, just doing what you're supposed to do. You can do this. (Applause.) But you could also help swing an entire precinct for Hillary's opponent with a protest vote or by not voting at all.\nSo here's what I'm asking you: Get out and vote. Get out and vote for Hillary. Vote early. Vote right now. Leave here, go vote. (Applause.) And don't let anyone take that right away from you.\nAs Hillary mentioned, you may have seen in previous weeks that folks were trying to cut early voting places, and cut the hours they were open. But that didn't stop people in this state. That's beautiful. Now, I understand there are more locations that are opening, and I want you all to crowd those places. I want you to remember that folks marched and protested for our right to vote. (Applause.) They endured beatings and jail time, they sacrificed their lives for this right. (Applause.) So I know you can get yourselves to the polls and exercise that right.\nBecause make no mistake about it, casting our vote is the ultimate way we go high when they go low. (Applause.) Voting is our high. That's how we go high: We vote. How do we go high?\nAUDIENCE: We vote!\nMRS. OBAMA: How do we go high?\nAUDIENCE: We vote!\nMRS. OBAMA: That's it. And after you vote, volunteer. No, no, no, no -- we need you to volunteer. Roll up your sleeves. Make calls. Knock on doors. Get people to the polls. It's turnout that's going to make the difference. We have to turn our people out. (Applause.)\nDo not let yourself get tired or frustrated or discouraged by the negativity of this election. As you are out there working your hearts out for my girl -- (laughter) -- here's the thing that I just want to tell you all, because this has been a draining election. But I urge you to please, please be encouraged. I want our young people to be encouraged. Because we still live in the greatest country on Earth. We do. (Applause.) And I have never felt more hopeful about the future. And I want -- our young people deserve that. Be encouraged.\nI feel that way because for the past eight years, I have had the great honor of being this country's First Lady. (Applause.) First Ladies, we rock. (Applause.) But I have traveled from one end of to this country to the other, and I have met people from every conceivable background and walk of life, including folks who disagree with just about everything Barack and I have ever said, but who welcome us into their communities. Remember, our neighbors are decent folks. These are all good people, who are open-hearted and willing to listen. And while we might not change each other's minds, we always walk away reminded that when it comes to what really matters, when it comes to our hopes and dreams for our children, we're just not all that different.\nAnd I want you to remember that it's that part of us as Americans, it is that piece of us that is in all of us. That's what drives folks like Hillary's mother, who said to herself, I may not have grown up in a loving family but I will build a loving family of my own, I will give my children what I never had, I will pour my heart into raising a strong, smart, loving daughter. (Applause.) That's what drives people like my father, who kept getting up and putting in those long hours, who said, I may not have gone to college, but I'm going to keep working because maybe my son, maybe my daughter will. Because in this country, anything is possible. (Applause.)\nAs we walk away from this election, remember: That is what makes us who we are. Remember that. It's a country where a girl like me from the South Side of Chicago, whose great-great grandfather was a slave, can go to the finest universities on Earth. A country where a bi-racial kid from Hawaii, the son of a single mother can make it to the White House. (Applause.) A country where the daughter of an orphan can break that highest and hardest glass ceiling and become President of the United States. (Applause.)\nThat is who we are. That is what's possible here in America, but only when we come together. Only when we work for it and fight for it.\nSo that's why, for the next 12 days, folks, we need to do everything possible to help Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine win this election. (Applause.) Are you with me? (Applause.) Are you with me? I can't hear you! Are we going to do this? (Applause.) We're going to vote! We're going to vote early! We're going to stand in line! We're going to make our voices heard! No one is going to take away our hope! (Applause.) Let's get this done.\nThank you all. God bless.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122583", "text": "For too long, Americans paid for health insurance that did not recognize that treatment for mental health and substance use disorders is as essential as other medical treatment. Untreated mental health and substance use disorders can be debilitating and life-threatening. These consequences are apparent in the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic, as well as the troubling rates of suicide and severe mental illness in this country.\nOne of the many important provisions of the Affordable Care Act and the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act is to ensure that health insurance plans treat mental health and substance use disorders the same way that they treat other health conditions. In March of this year, President Obama  established the Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Parity Task Force and charged Federal Departments and Agencies to work together to ensure that Americans are benefiting from the mental health and substance use disorder parity protections under the law. Parity aims to eliminate restrictions on mental health and substance use coverage – like annual visit limits, higher copayments, or different rules on how care is managed such as frequent pre-authorization requirements or medical necessity reviews – if comparable restrictions are not placed on medical and surgical benefits.\nToday in its  final report, the Task Force announced a series of actions and recommendations to help ensure better implementation of parity; to help consumers, providers, and plans understand how parity works; and to ensure appropriate oversight and enforcement of parity protections.\nThese steps are based on input the Task Force received through a series of listening sessions between March and October held with consumers, providers, employers, health plans, and State regulators, and through the more than 1,100 public comments the Task Force received from individuals with mental health and substance use disorders, families, their providers, advocates, and other stakeholders.\nToday, the Task Force announced the following actions:\n•      The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is awarding $9.3 million to States to help enforce parity protections. CMS funding will help State insurance regulators work to ensure issuer compliance with the mental health and substance use disorder parity protections.\n•      The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), in partnership with the Department of Labor (DOL) and other Task Force agencies, is releasing the beta version of a new parity website to help consumers find the appropriate Federal or State agency to assist with their parity complaints, appeals, and other actions. The Task Force received many comments about the challenges consumers face in identifying the appropriate agency that regulates their insurance coverage. The beta site is being released today for public comment. In the future, the Task Force Departments intend to work together to build out additional functionality on the website related to complaint and data tracking.\n•      The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and DOL are releasing a Consumer Guide to Disclosure Rights: Making the Most of Your Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Benefits to help consumers, their representatives, and providers understand what type of information to ask for when inquiring about a plan's compliance with parity and to explain the various Federal disclosure laws that also require disclosure of information related to parity. The Guide includes 11 scenarios, each with specific suggestions for information consumers have a right to that can help, as well as timing requirements for plans and issuers providing these documents.\n•      DOL is announcing that it will release annual data on closed Federal parity investigations and will report on the findings, including the violations cited to ensure parity compliance and inform future policymaking efforts. This effort builds on the 1,515 investigations related to the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act and 171 violations cited by DOL since October of 2010.\n•      To  ensure parity compliance in plans required to offer essential health benefits, CMS has added Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act compliance to its review of plans subject to the essential health benefits requirement under the Affordable Care Act, and it expects State regulators to do so as well.\n•      DOL, HHS, and the Department of Treasury (Treasury) are issuing guidance on parity and opioid use disorder treatment to address specific questions the Departments have received related to issues such as the application of parity to opioid treatment access and coverage of court-ordered treatment.\n•      HHS, DOL and Treasury are soliciting feedback on how the disclosure document request process can be improved (input is being sought through the FAQ process), while continuing to ensure consumers' rights to access all appropriate information and documentation. The request solicits input on the option of developing model forms for parity-related disclosure requests.\n•      SAMHSA is announcing that it will host two State Policy Academies on Parity Implementation for State Officials in Fiscal Year 2017, including one focused on the commercial market and one on parity in Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. These policy academies will bring together national experts to provide technical assistance to teams of State officials on strategies to advance parity compliance and lessons learned from other States' implementation efforts.\n•      CMS will undertake a review of mental health and substance use disorder benefits in Medicare Advantage plans and identify any necessary improvements to advance parity protections.\n•      DOL, HHS, and Treasury are issuing a Parity Compliance Assistance Materials Index. The Departments have issued a total of 44 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) over the past six years related to parity, generally as part of larger guidance documents, as well as other parity materials. Several commenters suggested to the Task Force that putting all the parity-related FAQs and guidance together in one place would make the information easier to find and use for States, plans consumers, and other stakeholders.\nIn addition, the Task Force made the following recommendations:\n•      Create a one-stop consumer web portal to help consumers navigate parity, which will build out the functionality of the beta parity website released today. The Task Force recommends that the website should help consumers solve coverage issues, file a complaint, or submit an appeal, and also be used to better inform parity oversight and enforcement efforts.\n•      Increase Federal agencies' capacity to audit health plans for parity compliance. The Task Force recommends that agencies' future budgets include funding to expand audit capacity. Given current resources, Federal parity enforcement efforts to date have generally focused on investigating consumer, provider and other parity complaints. Agencies' capacity to expand enforcement activities, including conducting random audits, is limited by their staffing resources.\n•      Undertake a detailed review of the non-quantitative treatment limits applicable to substance use disorder benefits in the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program. The Task Force received comments suggesting that non-quantitative treatment limits in FEHB plans may need examination and modification to ensure full compliance, as well as comments suggesting that consistent definitions of terms relating to residential treatment would provide greater transparency for consumers. The U.S. Office of Personnel Management has agreed to conduct this review over the coming year, and take corrective action as indicated by the findings.\n•      Allow the Department of Labor to assess civil monetary penalties for parity violations. Civil monetary penalty authority would lead to more meaningful penalties for non-compliance with parity. The Task Force recommends that Congress provide the Department of Labor with this authority.\n•      Develop examples of parity compliance best practices and of potential warning signs of non-compliance. Building on the 2016 DOL/HHS \"Warning Signs\" document identifying non-quantitative treatment limitations that require additional analysis to determine if they are in compliance with parity, the Task Force recommends a Warning Signs 2.0 document and encourages the inclusion of network adequacy issues in the document. The Task Force also recommends developing further examples of parity compliance best practices to illustrate appropriate application of non-quantitative treatment limitations that are comparable between mental health/substance use disorder benefits and medical/surgical benefits.\n•      Provide Federal support for State efforts to enforce parity through trainings, resources, and new implementation tools, including model compliance templates. The Task Force recommends continued Federal efforts to provide training and other resources to States to support compliance efforts including partnerships between State mental health/substance use, Medicaid, and State insurance agencies. Further, the Task Force recommends that Federal regulators work with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and the States to develop a standardized template that States might use to help assess parity compliance. The Task Force also encourages Federal regulators, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, and other stakeholders to consider a joint effort to develop a model prior authorization form and other model forms.\n•      Provide simplified disclosure tools to provide consistent information for consumers, plans and issuers. To facilitate disclosure, the Task Force recommends that, in coordination with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, templates and other sample standardized tools be developed to improve consumer access to plan information.\n•      Expand consumer education about parity protections. The Task Force recommends continuing and expanding the work to educate consumers about parity and partnering with consumer groups to increase consumer awareness and understanding of parity protections.\n•      Clarify that health plan disclosure requirements include medical and surgical benefits. The Task Force heard from commenters that it can be challenging to ensure parity compliance when information on medical and surgical benefits is not readily available to allow for comparison to mental health and substance use disorder benefits. Disclosure of the relevant information used to apply coverage limitations to medical and surgical services is currently required for plans covered under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). The Task Force recommends that Congress extend this requirement to non-ERISA plans.\n•      Implement the Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) parity final rule in a robust manner. The Task Force recommends that implementation include the development of a parity analysis toolkit to help States assess compliance with the final rules on parity for Medicaid managed care organizations and CHIP programs. The toolkit will review key considerations for defining and classifying mental health and substance use disorder benefits (including intermediate and long term supports and services), conducting claims-based analyses for quantitative treatment limits, identifying and analyzing non-quantitative treatment limits, and considerations for Alternative Benefit Plans and CHIP.\n•      Expand access to mental health and substance use disorder services in TRICARE. The Task Force recommends the Department of Defense's continued implementation of the TRICARE final rule on mental health and substance use disorders and parity through contract modifications and DOD's monitoring of access to mental health and substance use disorder care to ensure parity with medical/surgical care.\n•      Eliminate the lifetime day limit on Medicare Part A treatment in psychiatric hospitals. In Medicare Part A (hospital coverage), there is a 190-day lifetime limit on inpatient treatment in psychiatric hospitals while there is no such limit on inpatient medical/surgical hospital treatment. The Task Force recommends that Congress eliminate the psychiatric hospital lifetime day limit, consistent with the President's 2017 budget request.\n•      Update guidance to address the applicability of parity to opioid use disorder services. The Task Force recommends issuing guidance clarifying the application of parity to opioid use disorder treatment benefits in response to specific scenarios associated with these benefits raised by consumers and other stakeholders and updating this guidance regularly, as warranted.\n•      Eliminate the parity opt-out process for self-funded non-Federal governmental plans. Currently, self-funded non-Federal governmental plans have the ability to elect to not comply with certain Federal provisions including the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, which deprives thousands of employees of State and local governments of the mental health and substance use disorder parity protections. The Task Force recommends that Congress eliminate the ability of these plans to opt out of these protections.\nThese recommendations are subject to future budget and policy deliberations. Together, today's steps build on the ongoing work of the Administration to make the treatment of mental health and substance use disorders a priority. The Affordable Care Act ended insurance discrimination based on pre-existing conditions, including mental health and substance use disorders; required coverage of mental health and substance use disorder services in non-grandfathered plans in the individual and small group insurance markets; ensured that recommended preventive screenings, including for depression and alcohol misuse, are available with no co-pays; and expanded Medicaid to millions of additional Americans, significantly improving coverage for mental health care and substance use disorder treatment. In addition, the Administration has issued final regulations providing parity protections to individuals covered through the employer and individual insurance markets, people covered through Medicaid managed care organizations and the Children's Health Insurance Program, and service members and their families covered through TRICARE.\nThrough these steps, the country has made significant progress in expanding mental health and substance use disorder coverage and parity protections for millions of Americans. The Task Force report focuses on parity-related actions and recommendations and does not include the provisions in the President's Budget that would further expand access to care, including new investments in treatment capacity. The actions and recommendations announced today will continue to advance the Administration's progress on parity implementation.\nThe full report is available here: http://www.hhs.gov/parity", "timestamp": "2016-10-27", "title": "Fact Sheet: Federal Parity Task Force Takes Steps to Strengthen Insurance Coverage for Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders"}

In 12 days, we're going to win Ohio [applause]\nAnd we are going to win back the White House. [applause]\nA brand new poll from Remington Research highly respected has just a few minutes ago come out, and in Ohio we are right now, four points up. [applause]\nEarly voting is underway, so make sure, get out and vote, we don't wanna we don't wanna give this away.\nAUDIENCE: No!\nYou know, we have a movement going on like they've never seen before in this country. Drain the swamps, you've gotta a \"drain the swamp\" sign back there, we're going to drain the swamp, believe me. [applause]\nBut this is a movement like they've never seen in this country before, and every place is packed, and the greatest people on Earth, and we're going to turn our country around, we're going to turn it around fast. [applause]\nSeventy-five percent of the people think our country is headed in the wrong direction. We know it's headed in the wrong direction. We're going to fix it, we're going to take our country back, and it's going to be put very quickly on the right track. [applause]\nReal change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare. [applause]\nIt's just been announced that Americans are going to experience another massive double-digit hike in Obamacare, you see that. [booing]\nIncluding premiums like in the great state of Arizona, where they're going to go up at 116 percent. Don't worry, you'll be there very soon, unless I win in which case you're not going to have to worry about it. [applause]\nEven Bill Clinton admitted that Obamacare is quote, \"The craziest thing in the world, where people wind up paying their premiums which double, and their coverage is cut in half.\"\nJob killing [applause]\nJob killing Obamacare is just one more way the system is rigged. Remember the name Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare? [booing]\nHe said they could pass Obamacare when he didn't know he was being recorded he said they could pass Obamacare, because the stupidity of the American voter will allow it to take place. [booing]\nThe only stupidity was that incredible stupidity shown by our politicians when they forced this bill through over the furious objection to many politicians, in all fairness, many, many politicians, but really the American people. And it was very, very sad. And in all fairness to the Democrats, had our President not lied 28 times remember, you can keep your plan, you can keep your doctor, it passed by this much they would not have gone for it. But they believed him too, like everybody else believed him.\nThey've caught them in a lot of lies lately, folks. Hillary Clinton, talking about liars, wants to double down [applause]\nHillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare and make it even worse. So, here, I'm going to repeal it, replace it. We're going to have a replacement that is so much less expensive and so much better. You don't even get to use Obamacare because the deductible is so high and, you know, it's just Look, it is so it is so out of control, you'll never get to use it. Four or five thousand dollars before you can start taking Just this and just happened, Hillary Clinton declared that Obamacare do you remember this not so long ago as one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party, and of our county. It's a total disaster. [booing]\nHere in Ohio, another five insurance companies are dropping out of Obamacare. Good luck, good luck in negotiations, folks. That means that all the residents covered by plans from these companies will be getting cancellation notices very soon. Obamacare is really and you know this a catastrophe it's a catastrophic event for Ohio workers and is making it impossible for many parents to pay their bills, support their families, or get quality medical care to their children. Repealing Obamacare is one of the single most important reasons we must win on November eighth. [applause]\nHave to win. Real change also means getting rid of the corruption in Washington, D.C. [applause]\nHillary Clinton bleached and deleted 33,000 e-mails, lied to Congress under oath, made 13 phone calls, I mean 13, 13 phones, made them disappear, sometimes with a hammer. Right? Wrong, wrong. Let's get rid of these And then told the FBI she could remember 39 different times.\nThe Clinton crew gave more than $675,000 to the wife of the Deputy Director of the FBI, and the man who was overseeing the investigation into Hillary's illegal server, a server we now know Obama knew about. Just found that out yesterday. WikiLeaks. The more e-mails WikiLeaks releases, the more lies between the Clinton Foundation, the Secretary of State's office, and the Clintons' personal finances, they all get blurred.\nJust today we read about Clinton confidante Doug Brand, bragging that he had funneled tens of millions of dollars to Bill Clinton, Inc., through the Foundation donations, paid speeches, and consulting contracts. Mr. Band called the arrangement unorthodox. The rest of us call it outright corrupt. In fact, the Clinton Foundation even hired a law firm to find out if their pay to play scheme would jeopardize their charitable status with the IRS.\nIf the Clintons were willing to play this fast and loose with their enterprise when they weren't in the White House, just imagine what they'll do given the change to once again control the Oval Office. And we've had enough. Honestly, I think we've had enough of the Clintons, in all fairness. Right? Don't you agree? [applause]\nHad enough. I mean at what point, at what point do we say it? Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the presidency. [applause]\nI propose a contract with the American voter that will end the corruption and give the government back to the people. I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words I'm about to say. If we win on November eighth, when [applause]\nOK, OK. When we win on November eighth. [applause]\nWe don't want to take it for granted, but we are winning in a lot of states, I have to say. The media now, they're going wild. The media's going wild. Because they're saying, you know, this guy's winning in Florida, he's winning in North Carolina, he's winning in Iowa, he's winning in Ohio. All right. When we win, right, we are going to Washington, D.C., and we are going to drain the swamp. [applause]\nA lot of spirit in this room it's a good one. That includes a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress. At the core of my contract is my economic plan. That plan can be summarized in three very beautiful words, especially for the people in this area and this room jobs, jobs, jobs.\nNo, it's terrible what's happened, what's happened in this area, what's happened in this country with jobs is terrible. Hillary Clinton promised to bring upstate New York 200,000 jobs when she ran for Senate. Instead the jobs left. They didn't come in, they left. She been there for 30 years and hasn't fixed anything. She's just made things worse, except for herself and her husband.\nForty-seven million Americans are on food stamps, and 45 million Americans live in poverty. Nearly one in four Americans, in their prime earning years, are not working or able to work. Seventy million American women and children are in poverty or on the brink of poverty, and nearly half of African-American children under the age of six are living in abject poverty\nOur national debt has doubled in eight years, and our infrastructure throughout our country is crumbling, bad shape. Our airports, our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our schools, our hospitals. Our trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 billion a year. We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. Think of it. And that's so true. The single greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.\nWhat our politicians have allowed to happen to this area, but to all areas of our country. NAFTA, TPP they want to approve. A disaster. Ohio has lost one in four manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported strongly by Hillary Clinton. Remember, every time you see a closed factory, a wiped out community in Ohio, it was essentially caused by the Clintons. It was NAFTA. It was caused by the Clintons. Why a deal like that was allowed.\nWe've lost 70,000 factories. Think of that one, 70. I tell everybody, it's a typo. Can't be 70,000. It is. We've lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization, another Bill and Hillary-backed disaster. Just this year, Eaton Corporation in Ohio closed its plant, laid off 152 workers, and moved their jobs to Mexico. And you've had many. I could I could name them all day long.\nUnder my contract, if a company wants to fire their workers, move to Mexico or other countries, and ship their products back into the United States, we will put a 35 percent tariff on those products. [applause]\nAnd folks, just in case you have any questions, when that happens you're not losing your companies anymore. And if you do, at least the country's gonna make a lot of money. OK? We will immediately begin renegotiating NAFTA, and if we don't get the deal we want - right now it's a one-way highway. We lose our jobs, we lose our companies, we lose everything. We lose our cash. They get the cash, they get the jobs, they get the companies. We get the drugs, we get the unemployment. That's what we get. We get nothing. We get less than nothing.\nWe will terminate NAFTA and get a much better deal for our workers if we can't renegotiate it properly. We're gonna get a better deal for our workers and for our companies. Because we cannot continue to be the people led by stupid people. We can't. We can't. [applause]\nAs part of our plan to bring back American jobs we will lower taxes on our businesses from 35 percent down to 15 percent. We will also cut taxes for middle class families by 35 percent and massively simplify taxes for all Americans. We will be a rich nation once again. [applause]\nBut to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country. Hillary Clinton unleashed ISIS onto the world, you know that story. And spreading violently, it's spreading now into the United States. There are now 1,000 open ISIS investigations in the United States. ISIS is on a campaign of genocide against Christians in the Middle East, or what they call the Nation of the Cross. OK. The Nation of the Cross.\nThey are crucifying, drowning and beheading their victims. This is something that we would read about in history books. And not since medieval times, right? Have you heard the beheadings and all the things that are happening. So we have no choice. We will stop ISIS and we still stop them fast. [applause]\nAnd unlike what they've done in Mosul, which is turning out to be very difficult, we're not giving three and four months notice. We're coming in. We're coming in. You think General George Patton would say, \"We're coming in in three or four months, get ready\"? What a bunch. They're throwing people off buildings, hanging their victims from meat hooks. They're hanging their victims from meat hooks. The New York Post just published reports about ISIS crushing children to death and burning adults alive.\nNow Hillary wants massive immigration from the most dangerous regions of the world, where ISIS operates, including a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees over and above the thousands and thousands that President Obama is taking. [booing]\nWe don't want ISIS in our country. The Hillary refugee plan would leave us with generations of terrorism, radicalism and extremism inside of our shores. I only want to admit people who will support this country and love its people. SO important. [applause]\nKeeping our families safe is the highest obligation of the president of the United States. A Trump administration is going to suspend immigration from terror-prone regions. And we will suspend the Syrian refugee program. That was easy. [applause]\nWe're not going to take the risk when it comes to the safety of the American people. No longer. So let me state this as clearly as I can. If I'm elected president, I am going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. [applause]\nHillary also said she wants totally open borders. [booing]\nNo one who supports open borders can ever serve as president of the United States. Totally open borders. A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. And yes, we will build a wall. [applause]\nHave to. We have to.\nAudience: Build that wall. Build that wall. Build that wall.\nAnd who is going to pay for the wall? [applause]\nOne hundred percent. Mexico, in terms of our trade deficits, is making a fortune off the United States. Their leaders are doing a much smarter job. But you know what? We'll be happy with Mexico. Mexico's gonna be wonderful, we're going to have a great relationship with Mexico, with China and with other - we don't even have good relationships now. They rip us off and we still don't get along. At least they should be nice to us. They're not even nice. They'll be nice.\nThousands of Americans have been killed by illegal immigrants. Right here in Ohio. Sixty-year old Margaret Costleman was murdered in cold blood by an illegal immigrant. Earlier that day her killer shot another woman in the arm while she was with her children in a nearby park. Police encountered the man more than three weeks before the crime scene, but federal authorities refused to take him into custody, even though people were saying, \"Please, please don't let him out. Please take him in.\"\nThen there is the case of 90-year old Earl Olander, a Minnesota farmer who was brutally beaten by illegal immigrants and left to bleed to death in his home. Earl's body was found with his hands bound behind his back with duct tape. A blunt force injury to his head. His killers had criminal records but they did not meet the Obama administration's priorities for removal. [booing]\nBut others that knew him and others that knew them were pleading, were pleading, \"Don't let them out. Don't let them into our society.\" I have a message for the cartels, the drug dealers and the gang members. When I win, your long reign of crime and terror and horror will come to a very beautiful crashing end. [applause]\nWe will also repeal Obama-Clinton defense cuts and rebuild our badly depleted military. Our Air Force is the smallest and oldest it's ever been. Did you know that? Because I know what you have here. You guys are good with Wright Patterson. Right? What a great place. But we're very depleted, we have old equipment. We will build brand new, modern, state of the art planes to fly right at 'em, right at Wright Patterson Air Force Base. We have a lot of veterans here today.\nI want to thank them for their service and let them know as president I have your back. Believe me. [applause]\nI have your back. We will. She just said, \"Make America great again, Mr. Trump.\" We will make America great again. Don't worry about it. We will. And it won't take too long. We will change our foreign policy. Hillary Clinton's policies in Iraq, Syria, Libya threw the Middle East into total turmoil. We're spending $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East while our own country falls into total disrepair. Now Hillary wants to start a shooting war in Syria, conflict with a nuclear power - Russia - which could very well lead to World War III.\nAnd the way she talks about Putin. She's always said she has no idea, but she's always saying Wikileak, it's Russia, and Donald Trump I have nothing to do with Russia.\nShe said maybe Donald Trump is involved in projects with the Russians. The answer's no, no. But what she does, she says Donald Trump and Russia. Look, look, she speaks so badly of Putin, nuclear country, she speaks so badly, I say and she uses it to keep trying to get votes.\nI said to myself you know, how do you speak so badly of somebody, I mean how are they going to ever get along? Wouldn't it be great if we actually got along with Russia and other countries? [applause]\nAnd we together went after ISIS and knocked the hell out of them? Wouldn't that be a good thing? [applause]\nBecause they want to get them out also. [applause]\nBut she speaks very badly of Putin, and I don't think that's smart, you know. You can be very tough, but you shouldn't be doing what she's doing. As her own team has said in Wikileaks, she has terrible instincts. To all Americans I say it's time for new leadership, it really is time. [applause]\nIt really is. [applause]\nCan you imagine four more years of Obama? That's what you got to [booing]\nIt's high taxes, it's high regulations, all these companies they can't even breathe with the regulations, unnecessary. It's ISIS all over the place. You know, she says she'll stop ISIS. Let me tell you, there was no ISIS. There was no ISIS. During her term, she created with Obama a vacuum in Iraq, ISIS formed, and then Obama called them the JV, junior varsity, right?\nWell they're not the JV anymore, folks. They're going to be no trouble, we are going to knock them so hard. But look, look, they're not the JV, and they weren't them. And now they're in 32 different countries. So she's saying we will get rid of ISIS. She wants to go back home and go to sleep, that's what she wants to do. [applause]\nDid you see where she got upset yesterday because I took a little while, just a few hours, to cut a ribbon to make sure my kids did a good job? We built the building by the way, under budget, and ahead of schedule. [applause]\nAnd she said Donald Trump got off the campaign trail. I mean I've been doing six, seven, eight things a day every single day. She's home sleeping half the time. [applause]\nI say she's definitely a low energy person. I said where is Hillary? I watched after the last debate, and after the second debate. She was tired, wow. [applause]\nShe walked off that stage, she had a lot of people around, they had a lot of people around her, which was smart. Everything will change in November. Just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days. [applause]\nWe're going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan.\nWe're going to eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation. [applause]\nWe're going to provide school choice and put an end to Common Core. [applause]\nWe're going to rebuild our military, and take care of our vets. [applause]\nWe will support the truly great men and women of law enforcement. [applause]\nWe are going to save our second amendment which is under siege. [applause]\nAnd we'll appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court, so important, who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. [applause]\nAmericans are tired of being told by politicians they have to defer their dreams to another day, but they really mean another decade. It's like our politics are caught in time loop. We keep electing the same people over and over again, Clinton, Clinton, oh, Clinton, the impeachment, the lying, the whole thing.\nWe're going to keep make the same mistakes if you keep doing that, and we are going to continue to hear the same old excuses. These career politicians keep telling us that things can't change, that we can't find new solutions. That's basically what they tell us.\nWell I have a message for them. The future belongs to the dreamers, not the cynics, and not the critics. The future belongs to the dreamers. [applause]\nI'm asking all Americans to join me in dreaming big and bold things for our future. I'm going to fight for every American, of every background, in every stretch of this nation. I'm going to fight to liberate our citizens from violence and poverty, and crime and fear.\nAnd I'm going to fight for the inner cities, and for the African- American community, and the way they're forced to live in the inner cities with no jobs, no education, and no safety. [applause]\nI'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people, not the donors, and not the special [applause]\nI'm going to fight to bring us all together as Americans. Just imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together again as one people under one God, saluting one American flag. [applause]\nThat's right, once again we will have a government of, by, and for the people. [applause]\nYou gotta get out and vote. It's going to be something special. And I tell you this, and I tell others this sometimes, this is amazing group of people, the spirit, the energy, the genius, the genius. But you will say that this will be one of the great and most important meetings of your life, but most importantly, you will say that this vote will be the most important vote you've ever cast. [applause]\nBecause our country doesn't win anymore. We don't win with trade, we don't win with our great military, we don't allow them to win, we don't win with ISIS\nThe world is laughing at us. We don't win at the borders. We don't win with taking care of our vets. We don't win with anything. We don't win anymore. We will start winning again like you've never seen before. [applause]\nAnd I kiddingly say that one of our great two congressmen that are here someplace where are those great guys? They're here. They're going to be coming to see me at the White House, and they're going to say Mr. President, Mr. President sir, Mr. President [applause]\nThe people of Ohio, they can't take it anymore, sir. You're winning too much.\nYou knocked out ISIS, there are too many jobs in Ohio, too many companies are pouring in. We have a little traffic. Traffic wouldn't be a bad thing [applause]\nWe are going to win like never before. [applause]\nWe are going to make our country wealthy again. We are going to make America strong again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again.\nThank you very much. Thank you, everybody. [applause]\nMake sure you go out and vote. God bless you. God bless you.

In his remarks, he referred to Dora Garcia Correa, community organizer, Enroll America, who introduced the President; and Jill T. Biden, wife of Vice President Joe Biden.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119605", "text": "Thank you so much, Dora. And thank you for the incredible work that you've done in the Rio Grande Valley. I know you've just signed up people tirelessly. And from vetting in-person assistance in the local Head Start programs so that you can reach parents, hosting 24-hour enrollment events with elected officials, going out on field trips to help agricultural workers get themselves and their families covered—you have done it all.\nAnd for those of you who are listening, you should know that Dora's nickname is Dora the Explorer because she goes after everything. And it's the reason that we've seen so much success all across the country, is because of people like Dora and all of you who are on this call.\nThis is the largest call we've ever hosted from the White House. We've got over 25,000 folks registering from across the country, and that's a testament to how much passion and how many people are behind this effort. And all of you are so dedicated to helping people in your community get access to quality and affordable coverage.\nSo I wanted to take a few minutes just to speak to you right now before we kick off our fourth open enrollment period on November 1, because you've been working hard to get ready and I want you to know that I am paying attention and everybody in my administration is going to be working just as hard alongside you.\nNow, the good news is, thanks to the ACA, 20 million Americans have gained coverage. The Nation's uninsured rate now stands at its lowest level ever. But we've got more work to do because we have millions more to cover. And I know that you've seen some of the headlines this week about premiums. They're increasing in some States, even though they're very stable in one State or even they're declining. But I want to make sure everybody has the facts you need to be successful in your efforts to reach those who don't get coverage on the job or don't qualify for Medicare or don't qualify for Medicaid. Those for—those are the folks who, for too long, fell through the cracks. And they were the people who ACA was designed to help.\nFor them, if they're shopping in the marketplace in 2017, because of the tax credits that protect people from rising premiums, more than 7 in 10 consumers will be able to find a plan for less than $75 a month. And if they're a returning customer, who is shopping around and selecting the lowest cost plan offered that has similar benefits, the average premiums would actually fall by $28 per month, or 20 percent, compared to last year. So they actually decrease, not increase, by 20 percent. And these are the kinds of things that somehow are not always reported on.\nThe one thing that's been a challenge, obviously, since we passed the Affordable Care Act is the politics of it. Because there is a faction of people who are continually trying to root for failure, despite the fact that we keep on insuring people and folks continue to get help.\nSo the bottom line is that most people are going to be pleasantly surprised at just how affordable their options are if we can just get them to see for themselves. This is not one of those things where they're going to be surprised or have to engage in guesswork. If we are able to get people to actually check out their options for themselves at healthcare.gov, they will find out that despite some of the headlines that don't always explain the fact that premiums going up don't necessarily translate into higher premiums for people who are getting tax credits—if they can just see that for themselves, then they will exercise that option. But we're going to have to kind of clear the bugs off the windshield so people can see the road ahead. And that's where you guys come in. That's why what you do is so important. Because there may be people who haven't yet signed up for affordable care, are cynical or skeptical about the marketplace because of all the political noise around, and so they've never actually bothered to take a look to see if this something that they—could help them and something that they can afford.\nAnd I know the amazing impact you can make in your communities by helping folks get covered because your work is one part recruitment—you're out there busting up misinformation and myth. You're a counselor and a friend as you help people make the right choice for their families. I have seen you do it. I saw the efforts that Milwaukee took in the Healthy Communities Challenge last year. They were opening up libraries for enrollment events, digital signs on county buses. And it reached tens of thousands of uninsured in that community.\nIn Miami Dade College, where I went last week, it's a school that set the standard for the way campuses should engage their students and faculty and staff and alumni to make sure they know what options are available to them to give them peace of mind and to save them money. And in fact, Miami Dade was part of the inspiration of this year's Healthy Campus Challenge, our effort to work with campuses and local community leaders to reach the uninsured both on campus and in surrounding communities.\nAnd I hope schools that are on the line will opt in to our Healthy Campus Challenge by November 1, because there are tons of young people who are uninsured. They're the cheapest to insure. They're going—they've got the most affordable options available, but oftentimes, when you're young, you think you're invincible, and you don't worry about it until, unfortunately, something happens.\nSo I'm incredibly optimistic about the great work you're going to do during this enrollment season. And just so you know, we're not letting up here. Michelle and I and Joe Biden and Jill Biden, we're going to be right by your side. We're going to be doing op-eds and calling into radio programs and doing all kinds of PSAs and just getting the word out. And we just have to keep running through the tape until the end of the open enrollment period on January 31 and beyond.\nBut the main thing I just wanted to say to all of you is, I could not be more grateful for your commitment. This has been one of the honors and privileges of being President, was to see each of you engaging in this life-changing and lifesaving work. And I am grateful for that.\nBut I want to end by not only saying thank you, but also recognizing the challenge we've got here. Because of the incredibly fierce political resistance around giving everybody health care—something I've never fully understood, why anybody would run on a platform of people being uninsured instead of insured—part of what we can do this time is to overcome the skeptics, to prove people wrong, and to provide momentum so that when the next administration comes in, they are starting from a position of strength, and we'll be able to say, you know what, this program is working well, it can work even better.\nAnd I think that this ends up being really a test of our commitment to health care over the long term, not just this open enrollment period. And I think we're at a critical time where we have to show that this program works for people if they just see what their options are. And we're not going to get that much help through the media. It's—this is going to be a ground game. This is a matter of going door to door, campus to campus, friend to friend, neighbor to neighbor, person to person. You are the people who are going to make sure that this starter home we built with the Affordable Care Act ultimately delivers on the promise that every single person in America has health care. And in this process, I'm just one player, and the legislation is just the beginning. You are the ones who are going to really make an impact. And if you guys do a great job this time out, then it's not just the people you are signing up this time that are going to be impacted; you will create the atmosphere that allows us to make sure that we build on this progress.\nAnd ultimately, not only the millions of people who still don't have coverage in this country are going to get it, but all the generations to come who will be able to look back and say this was the moment when we really delivered on a longstanding promise of affordable health care for every single person in America. They're going to be able to look back and say that those folks who were in neighborhoods and making calls and knocking on doors and working on their college campuses, they were the ones who did it. So it's in your hands, and I need you guys to really understand that.\nSo God bless you. I'm so proud of all of you. And with that, I'm going to turn over the call to Secretary Sylvia Burwell, who is going to be able to give you all kinds of details and updates in terms of how the ACA is working. Okay?\nThank you so much, everybody.

With honor and distinction, our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen fight to defend the principles upon which our Republic was founded so that we might live in a freer and more prosperous world. Behind these courageous Americans stand spouses, children, and parents who give up precious time with their loved ones, bearing the burden of long deployments and difficult moves, and oftentimes putting their careers on hold. During Military Family Month, we salute the families of those who proudly are a part of our Nation's unbroken chain of patriots for their unwavering devotion, and we renew our sacred vow to uphold our promise to our troops, our veterans, and their families.\nOur military would not be the greatest in the world without the strength and support of the loved ones who stand alongside our men and women in uniform. While our service members are fighting to secure the values we cherish and defend our homeland, their spouses keep their households running, sometimes through multiple deployments. Spouses of those in the military are often forced to relocate across our country or around the globe, leaving behind jobs they love and sometimes struggling to find new employment. They are our fellow citizens and neighbors; in their service to their families and their country, they represent the true strength of America.\nOur Nation has a solemn obligation to support and care for the members of our military and their families—from their first day of training until they conclude their service—and my Administration has worked to ensure we uphold this promise. Through First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden's Joining Forces initiative, we have worked with both the public and private sectors to ensure service members, veterans, and their families have the tools they need to succeed throughout their lives. Over the past 5 years, we have rallied businesses to hire more than 1.2 million veterans and military spouses. Today, every single State has taken action to streamline professional licensing and credentialing processes so that military spouses can continue their work when they move across State lines without having to re-certify for a job they are already qualified for. We are also working to provide the resources military families need to start businesses and pursue an education, and we are helping teachers and schools support military children from kindergarten through college. By partnering with the private sector, we have also helped expand access to essential science, technology, engineering, and math courses so that 60,000 more military children can be college-ready and prepared for 21st-century careers.\nWe must always be there for our service members and their families—just as they are there for us. Through the thickest of fights and the darkest of nights, our extraordinary military families—our heroes on the home front—stand alongside our patriots in uniform, and in their example we see the very best of our country's spirit. This month, let us thank them for their tremendous devotion to duty and for their unyielding sacrifice. Let us honor their resolve and patriotism and uphold our solemn responsibility to ensure the priorities of our Nation reflect the priorities of our military families. Now, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2016 as Military Family Month. I encourage all Americans to honor military families through private actions and public service for the tremendous contributions they make in support of our service members and our Nation.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-10-27", "title": "Proclamation 9529—Military Family Month, 2016"}

Families who choose the life-changing path of adoption make a meaningful and lasting difference in the lives of some of the most vulnerable young people in our society. Regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, race, or religion, devoted Americans who adopt help give more children the upbringing they deserve. Each November, we recognize the important role that adoption has played in the lives of children and families in our country and around the world, and we rededicate ourselves to ensuring every child can find their forever family.\nLast year, more than 100,000 children were waiting to be adopted from foster care, and every year, too many older youth age out of the foster care system before they are able to find permanence. Without this support during the critical years of early adulthood, these youth are more likely than their peers to experience homelessness, unemployment, or incarceration. To make the possibility of adoption real for more children across our country, my Administration has eliminated barriers to adoption by extending tax credits and providing financial incentives to child welfare agencies in almost every State to maximize adoptions. I have also worked to strengthen Federal workplace flexibility policies to ensure more families, including adoptive families, can keep their jobs and care for their children as their family grows.\nOn the Saturday before Thanksgiving, we also recognize National Adoption Day, kicking off a week of reflection and gratitude for many adoptive families. Each year on this day, thousands of adoptions are finalized, including more than 4,000 children in 2015. This year, cities from coast to coast will host a variety of events to commemorate the occasion.\nOne of the most important jobs many of us will ever have is being a parent. Throughout National Adoption Month, we celebrate all those who have invited a child in need into their hearts and into their homes, and we express our profound appreciation for all who help make adoptions possible. Let us continue strengthening the adoption process so that all children can learn, grow, and thrive with the support of a devoted and permanent family.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2016 as National Adoption Month. I encourage all Americans to observe this month by answering the call to find a permanent and caring family for every child in need and by supporting the families who care for them.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-10-27", "title": "Proclamation 9530—National Adoption Month, 2016"}

Welcome aboard Air Force One en route to Orlando. I have one scheduling announcement and one personnel announcement at the top. So I'll start with a quick scheduling announcement.\nBut I just want to let you know that after the event in Orlando this afternoon, the President will appear with three YouTube content creators. The President will have a conversation with Liza Koshy, Lia Marie Johnson, and Adande Thorne, known to you all as sWooZie. The President and sWooZie last spoke in January of 2016, after the State of the Union address, as part of our amplification efforts at that time.\nI also want to let you know that, as most of you probably have seen, today is Jess Allen's last day as press assistant at the White House. She started in the Obama family in 2012 as a media monitor on the reelection campaign. She then worked for the Inaugural Committee and came to the White House as a media monitor, and rose through the ranks to press assistant.\nI know it's probably fair to say she's helped all of you out a lot, but that probably pales in comparison to what she's done for everyone in the Press Office. We are grateful for her service. She's enormously talented, 100 percent dedicated, and whip-smart. So it says something about her character and her commitment to public service that she's not going very far. She'll be at the Department of Education helping out with the public affairs office there. And we wish her only the best and continued success.\nAnd with that, I'm happy to take your questions.\nQ: Eric, has the White House received notification from the FBI that they're investigating new emails related to Hillary Clinton?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Josh, the only notification we've received is the letter that was made public by press reports from Director Comey to Capitol Hill. I should be real precise about this. We have that letter after it was made public. So we did not have advance warning.\nQ: And you got it directly from the FBI after the press already had it and it was made --\nMR. SCHULTZ: I believe we got it through press reports.\nQ: You didn't get it separately? You just saw it in the media and read it there?\nMR. SCHULTZ: We saw it in the media. That was the first we learned of it.\nQ: I know you probably don't want to talk about details of an FBI investigation, but can you at least clarify whether there is an actual investigation that is now underway, or are they looking at emails to decide whether to reopen the investigation?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Josh, I am going to send you to the FBI for any questions about the nature of their work. The President's expectation is that all FBI efforts follow the facts wherever they lead. So I'm not going to be in a position to speculate on that. The President believes that decisions made by independent prosecutors must be made irrespective of politics, so I'm not going to be in a position to second-guess their work.\nQ: The President's assessment that Hillary Clinton hasn't put national security at risk through her email practices -- does that assessment need to be put on hold temporarily while this new information that's come to light is looked at by the FBI?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I don't think anything has surfaced to change the President's opinion and views of Secretary Clinton. In fact, I have good news for you. In about an hour and a half, we'll be on the ground in Orlando -- the President will be able to share his views of Secretary Clinton, why he believes she's uniquely qualified to be the next President of the United States. She happens to bring more experience to this race than any other nominee in American history. The President includes himself and Secretary Clinton's husband in that analysis. And so he's going to be proud to support her from now until Election Day.\nQ: Given that we're only like 11 days out or so from the election, will the President feel compelled to address this in any way, obliquely or directly, at this next rally? I mean, given that all the press attention is heating up today?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I would not expect anything on this in the President's remarks today. I think as a preview of the President's remarks, you can expect a lot of the themes he's hit before, touting why he believes Secretary Clinton is uniquely qualified to be Commander-in-Chief.\nAs you know, they ran a heated campaign primary battle in 2008 against each other, and the President is proud to count himself amongst the converts. He's gotten to see her work up close representing the United States' interests abroad, putting the interests of the American people first and foremost. He's proud of her service as Secretary of State, and that's why he's traveling across the country supporting her candidacy.\nQ: Does it seem accurate to say that the FBI is reopening the case since it doesn't really appear that the case was ever closed?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Tim, I understand the interest, but I'm going to have to refer you to the FBI for them to explain the nature of their work. I'm not going to be in a position to speculate on that.\nQ: -- going to Florida, the Senate race there -- Marco Rubio seems to be running a lot better than Hillary Clinton in that state. Why are voters splitting tickets in Florida? And is President Obama hoping to put this race back on the map?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Thanks, Sarah. I have a feeling the Murphy campaign doesn't think it ever fell off the map. But I would expect the President to talk about the Senate race in his remarks today. As he's said before, he believes Congressman Murphy has been a strong member of the House of Representatives for the people of Florida, a strong advocate for them in Washington, D.C. He's worked across party lines a number of times. One piece that comes to mind was his work to help expand protection of the Everglades.\nSo he's going to make the case for Congressman Murphy in his remarks today. He's also going to contrast Congressman Murphy's record with that of his opponent. Senator Rubio has a long record that he should be held accountable for, and I do expect the President to bring that up in today's remarks.\nQ: Do you think it was a mistake that some national Democratic groups pulled out of Florida a couple weeks ago?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Sarah, I used to work at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. I am familiar with how hard it is -- how complicated it is to make decisions regarding spending as campaigns wind down. So I'm not going to be in a position to second-guess those decisions. Those are made by the leaders of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in other campaigns.\nI can tell you for the President's views, that he believes Congressman Murphy should be promoted to the United States Senate, and that's the case he'll be making down there in Orlando this afternoon.\nQ: Can you be a little more clear about the YouTube creators? What is he going to talk to them about?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Sure. I'd expect the President to repeat a theme you've heard him talk about for a while now, which is the importance of getting out the vote; that each of these personalities have millions of followers, people who pay close attention to their work. And so the President wants to make sure that we are leaving no stone unturned when it comes to getting out the vote.\nA lot of these states already have early voting, so a lot of their followers can avail themselves of that right now.\nQ: Each of the organizations on this plane has millions of followers, probably. I know the Post has set record numbers this year. Why not sit down with other reporters in mainstream media that are on this plane? Would that be something he would think about? And why not do that? Why YouTube creators?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I look at your outlets and I see a lot of interviews that the President has given over the years. So I don't expect this to be the last conversation the President has. But if you guys are interested you can send a request our way.\nQ: Back on the emails, Director Comey said earlier this summer that due to the intense interest in this case that a higher level of transparency was required. Does the President agree with that? And does he believe that the voters deserve to know what the outcome of this latest wrinkle in the investigation will be before Election Day?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, Toluse, you're right, Director Comey did take the step to -- when he previously announced his decisions regarding this investigation, he gave an extensive statement to the press. He also testified for several hours under oath in front of Congress.\nSo the good news is that for those seeking information about their efforts here, he's answered a lot of questions. So I don't have anything to add to that other than to say if you have questions about Director Comey's decision to send this letter to the Hill, you should check with his office.\nQ: What does it say about the President's -- the nominee of his party that, barring an abnormally fast turnaround for the FBI, if Clinton is elected, there will be an active FBI look at her email situation even as she's preparing to take the Oval Office?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Well, Josh, again, I'll parse that out a little bit. If you have questions about the scope or the nature of the FBI work, you should check in with the FBI. If you have questions about the President's views of Secretary Clinton, you should tune in in about an hour and a half, because the President is going to make an enthusiastic, forceful case for why she should succeed him in the Oval Office.\nThe President believes we've made tremendous progress over the past eight years. That includes the longest stretch of private sector job growth in our nation's history. That includes advancing America's national security interest around the world. That includes extending health care to 20 million Americans who didn't have it before. That includes the highest graduation rates we've seen in recent history. That includes historic investments in clean energy. That includes a deal brokered to shut off Iran's path to a nuclear weapon. That includes an international deal brokered to reverse the effects of climate change and carbon emissions around the globe.\nSo the President is absolutely proud of the work we've accomplished over the past eight years. But as he has said, a lot of that is at stake on November 8th.\nQ: -- any thoughts about Senator Kirk's comments essentially mocking Tammy Duckworth's immigrant background?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I saw those comments this morning, Josh, from the debate last night. Obviously, as I understand it, Senator Kirk apologized over Twitter. But our views on Congresswoman Duckworth are well-known, which is she's an American hero, she's a true patriot. She has served her country in a number of capacities, including this administration, including on the battlefield, and hopefully next in the United States Senate.\nQ: That's the President's seat in the Senate and Tammy Duckworth is someone he knows very well. Did he have a personal reaction to that debate?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I haven't had a chance to talk to the President about this. But you're right, this seat is personal to him. This isn't just another congressional race. This is one that's important to him.\nI don't think you were there, Christi, but we did do an event for her -- the President traveled to Chicago and held an event to speak to her supporters. He feels very strongly that she deserves a seat in the United States Senate. She's courageously and bravely served this nation in a variety of capacities, again, including on the battlefield, including in this administration, caring for our veterans. And he believes she deserves a promotion to the Senate.\nQ: Does the President think that Vice President Biden would be a good Secretary of State in a Clinton administration?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I will take the Clinton campaign at their word that they are 100 percent focused on earning the 270 electoral votes in order for this to even be a decision for them to take.\nThat said, I think it should be no surprise that Vice President Biden would surface as a possibility for this role. He has deep foreign policy credentials. And if you look at the way the President approached this decision after he was elected in 2008, he wanted someone with star power on the international stage, someone he trusted 100 percent, someone with strong relationships around the world, and someone with the integrity and character to represent the United States' interest around the globe. So should Secretary Clinton be in a position to make a similar decision, it sounds like it would be following that playbook.\nQ: -- Vice President Biden interested in the job?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Sarah, this is not my first rodeo. You will have to check with the Vice President to ascertain his feelings on it.\nQ: Paul Ryan said this morning that Hillary Clinton's intelligence briefings should be suspended. Do you have a response to that?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Tim, what we said on this is that each nominee, after they formally receive their nominations at their respective conventions, are entitled by practice and by tradition to daily intelligence briefings. That is a process that's housed at the Director of National Intelligence office, and it's my understanding that those briefings continue to be a resource to which each candidate can avail themselves.\nQ: There were more than 100 arrests at the protests over the Dakota access pipeline yesterday. Does the President have a reaction to what's going on there? And what's his plan to sort of settle some of the unrest going on there?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Toluse, I can tell you that the White House is aware of the situation in North Dakota. I can also confirm for you that officials at the Department of Justice have been in touch with local officials and members of local law enforcement on the ground in North Dakota.\nBroadly speaking, I can tell you that the President has had a priority to improve nation-to-nation relationships and consultations more broadly with tribes. That's why he established the White House Council on Native American Affairs, and that's why he's made building stronger relationships and better channels of communications a priority over the past eight years.\nQ: The White House just held another major meeting of the Transition Council. Do you know why Trump's transition chairman, Chris Christie, was not attending that? Maybe there were traffic problems in Fort Lee.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Josh, you should check in with each campaign about the representative they sent to the meeting. But as you know, this is a priority that's front and center for this President -- making sure that there's a peaceful and seamless transition of power.\nThe President was enormously grateful for the work that President George W. Bush did in the waning months of his second term to make sure that President Obama and his team could hit the ground running. The President has been working on this for years now, laying the groundwork so that as this election draws near and as a President-elect is determined that that individual and his or her team can hit the ground running.\nQ: Eric, on a different topic, the Kennedy Center put out a video clip of Bill Murray taking a tour of the Oval Office with the President. And in that, Bill Murray asks the President about whether he has a good license plate. And the President seemed unaware that the presidential limo actually had license plates. That may come as news to D.C. residents who push for D.C. voting rights and statehood. And in 2013, the White House agreed to put the \"taxation without representation\" plates on the limo. Is the President not aware of that decision? I mean, that's an important thing for someone who is a D.C. resident and may be living here for another year and a half or two years.\nMR. SCHULTZ: David, I was part of the team in 2013 that had announced that the license plates were changing over to the \"taxation without representation\" plates. I know the President was proud of that decision. As you point out, he is likely to be a D.C. resident for at least a year or two after leaving the White House, so he strongly supports District rights.\nQ: Do you have a written version of those YouTube names?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Yes, we'll get you their names. And I should be clear that I believe they will be promoting them immediately following the interviews, which will happen immediately following the Orlando rally. But then it will be up to them when they release the full content of their work.\nI can also do a week ahead since it's Friday.\nOn Monday, the President and First Lady will welcome local children and children of military families to trick-or-treat at the South Portico of the White House.\nOn Tuesday, the President will participate in a Hillary for America event in Columbus, Ohio. Further details on the President's travel to Ohio will be available in the coming days.\nOn Wednesday, the President will participate in a Hillary for America event in Raleigh, North Carolina. Wednesday evening, the President will travel to Miami, Florida, and will remain there overnight.\nOn Thursday, the President will participate in a Hillary for America event in Miami. Afterward, the President will travel to Jacksonville to participate in a Hillary for America event there. And later, the President will return to Washington, D.C.\nOn Friday, the President will participate in a Hillary for America event at a location that hasn't been announced yet, but when we have those details we will release them.\nThank you.\nEND 3:44 P.M.

We need jobs to offer the kind of pay and benefits that let people raise a family. And in order to do that, workers need a voice. They need the voice and the leverage that guarantees this kind of middle-class security. . . So we've got to make sure . . . working Americans don't get lost in the shuffle. They can come together and they can win.\"\n— President Barack Obama, White House Worker Voice Summit, October 7, 2015\nLast year, President Obama hosted the first-ever Summit on Worker Voice at the White House bringing together a diverse group of workers, employers, unions, organizers, advocates, academics, and business leaders to explore ways to ensure that middle-class Americans are sharing in the benefits of the economic growth that they are helping to create. It focused on how working Americans can make their voices heard for higher wages, safer workplaces, paid leave, and other improvements in the workplace, whether it be through joining or forming a union, starting a conversation with coworkers, or leveraging technology and online tools.\nThe President made clear that the summit was only the beginning of the conversation and issued a call to action to all who attended to come up with new ideas and identify promising campaigns and tools to lift up worker voice:\n\"[T]his is the beginning of a conversation that I want to push for the next 15 months, through the end of my presidency...we provided the platform, but you own this thing...the deal is I will work with you around the ideas that you identify.

The tool guides workers on a structured journey that provides them with opportunities to take action or find help if they have had wages stolen, been injured on the job, faced discrimination, or been retaliated against for joining together to seek better wages or conditions at work.\nWorker.gov was developed in response to feedback received during the White House Summit on Worker Voice, regional worker voice summits, and listening sessions with workers across the nation who found existing government websites detailing their rights difficult to navigate or understand. The new tool allows workers to describe themselves and their concerns and eliminates guesswork about which federal agency or statute covers their complaint.\nThis website synthesizes content from the Department of Labor, Department of Justice, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and the National Labor Relations Board, and was created and developed in partnership with a team of Presidential Innovation Fellows. Today represents a soft launch as a beta prototype—which is now available for testing—with limited but significant functionality. While initially targeted at construction workers, day laborers, office workers, nail salon workers, and restaurant workers, the site provides important information for all workers and will be expanded over time to include a broader range of occupations and industries.\nGoing forward, worker.gov will continue to evolve and improve in response to input and feedback of users. In this effort, workers will have voice in the design and future of the site, which holds the potential to harness technology and government data to better empower workers.\nREGIONAL SUMMITS\nBuilding on the momentum generated from the White House Worker Voice Summit and President Obama's call to action, this year Secretary of Labor Tom Perez and other senior Administration officials traveled to five cities across the country for a series of regional summits. These events were focused on bringing together seasoned and emerging leaders who are lifting up workers' voices and empowering ordinary Americans to be agents of change. These regional summits helped tell the unique story of how workers, organizers, unions, and employers are coming together to create positive change in their workplaces and communities:\n•      Minneapolis, MN (2/9/16): The  Minneapolis Worker Voice Summit featured union workers from New Flyer, a bus manufacturer and partner of AFL-CIO's Jobs to Move America campaign, which seeks to ensure that taxpayer dollars spent on public transit support the creation of good manufacturing jobs here in America. The summit featured organizers from Centro de Tabajadores Unidos en Lucha and Take Action Minnesota, individuals involved in the construction of the Vikings Stadium, and local businesses such as Target. Breakout discussions explored issues of importance to the community such as paid sick time and taxi driver organizing campaigns.\n•      Los Angeles, CA (4/8/16): At the Los Angeles Worker Voice Summit, organizers from the CLEAN Carwash Campaign spoke about their  efforts helping carwash workers have a voice on the job. The summit featured ongoing organizing efforts in the grocery and restaurant industries and highlighted a partnership between AFL-CIO, Kinkisharyo (a manufacturer of railroad vehicles), and the Los Angeles Black Worker Center to bring good jobs to economically challenged communities. The Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy and the Teamsters highlighted their partnership in the environmental trucking industry. One breakout discussion focused on a new initiative in the entertainment industry in which SAG-AFTRA, the Writers' Guild, and the Directors' Guild are exploring how to remove obstacles for low budget productions while maintaining union representation.\n•      New York City, NY (5/6/16): The New York City Worker Voice Summit highlighted recent successes in raising the minimum wage and ongoing organizing efforts of airport workers to raise their wages and the partnership between restaurant owners and workers to eliminate the tipped minimum wage. The New York City Summit also featured representatives from Transform Don't Trash NYC, a partnership between the Teamsters, NYC Environmental Justice Alliance, and Alliance for a Greater New York to improve poor working conditions in the commercial waste industry, reduce waste and pollution, and foster clean and healthy communities for New Yorkers.\n•      Washington, DC (6/15/16): The Department of Labor and the White House hosted the Women's Worker Voice Summit the day after the White House United State of Women Summit. This summit included remarks from Lilly Ledbetter, an equal pay advocate for whom the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was named, as well as workers from the airport and fast food industries. An all-women panel featured leaders of ACE Hardware stores in the Washington, DC area, Jobs with Justice, and a grocery worker. Breakout sessions included discussions on pay transparency, home care workers, and using technology to empower workers.\n•      Austin, TX (9/15/16): The  Austin Worker Voice Summit was cohosted by the Department of Labor and the Workers Defense Project (Proyecto Defensa Laboral) and featured voices from across the South including the Florida Central Labor Council, Mississippi casinos employer MGM Resorts International, and organizers and advocates from Georgia STANDUP. A key focus was a recent breakthrough in Austin granting expedited permitting for construction projects only if builders offer significant new worker protections and higher wages.\nPRIVATE SECTOR ACTION\nIn the year since the Worker Voice Summit, unions, workers, advocates, and businesses have responded to the President's call to action by launching new tools and pioneering other innovative ways to make workers' voices heard and empower them with information. A few examples of activity in the past year from the private sector include:\n•      Centro de Tabajadores Unidos en Lucha (CTUL): About 600 retail janitors have demonstrated a new and effective strategy for overcoming the challenge of organizing multiple employers at once in an industry dominated by a fissured business model. CTUL secured a commitment from Target to use a responsible contractor policy for any janitorial contracts. After this significant commitment, workers decided to organize a union. Through their efforts, they won the right from three major contractors to engage in collective bargaining once they gained recognition from contractors cleaning 60 percent of the approximately 300 big box retail stores in the Minneapolis area. This sectoral and trigger-based approach resulted in winning union recognition and an on-going voice in the workplace and may offer promise in other regions and occupations.\n•      Coworker.org: Since co-hosting the town hall at the White House Worker Voice Summit with President Obama, Coworker.org has greatly expanded its networks of workers who have connected on their platform in successful efforts to improve their working conditions. For example, a restaurant worker who asked the President about wages for restaurant workers saw success in her campaign for wage increases within a month of the summit. Employees of REI launched an effort to increase wages and improve shift scheduling, and they were thrilled when their company announced a wage increase of up to 15 percent for stores in seven cities. Employees at Netflix and Keen Shoes were successful in securing expanded paid parental leave.\n•      Jobs to Move America: The Jobs to Move America Coalition includes community, labor, faith, environmental, and civil rights groups working to ensure that public dollars spent on transit systems create better jobs, cleaner equipment, and more opportunity for communities. The coalition aims to expand the number of transit authorities adopting its pioneering U.S. Employment Plan, which includes provisions for training, recruiting, and hiring workers from disadvantaged communities. In September 2016, the New York City Metropolitan Transportation Authority agreed to adopt the U.S. Employment Plan in its upcoming Request for Proposal for a $3.2 billion contract to produce more than 1,000 subway cars. It joins the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit Authority, Chicago Transit Authority, and Amtrak, which had already adopted the plan.\n•      Kaiser Permanente: Since participating in the White House Summit, Kaiser Permanente has announced that they have deepened their commitment to worker voice by launching a \"Free to Speak\" campaign. The campaign provides online tools and training materials to help managers lead more inclusively, to encourage workers to speak up, and to facilitate more courageous conversations. For example, in Portland, OR, a technologist in the neurology department shared an idea for remotely monitoring seizures in epileptic patients with a physician, and working together, they were able to secure the equipment they needed to put the idea into action.\n•      Know Your Worth by Glassdoor is a new tool, launched in beta last week, that uses data science and machine learning algorithms to calculate a worker's real-time worth in today's job market. It is designed to help people determine if they are being paid fairly and help inform whether they should attempt to negotiate their current salary or explore better paying jobs. Workers enter basic details, such as a current title, employer, salary, location, and years of experience, to estimate their market value. Individual market values are personal and private, are recalculated weekly, and tracked over time to help people stay informed about their work in an ever-changing labor market.\n•      TogetherWeWork.comis a new project of The Workers Lab, inspired by the White House Summit on Worker Voice and launched earlier this month at South By South Lawn. This new platform empowers young Americans to join together with their coworkers and communities to improve their working lives. It seeks to provide the inspiration needed to get involved and offers a curated collection of tools and campaigns to help take collective action and bring democracy to work. Of particular note, TogetherWeWork.com connects, curates, and facilitates conversations and community among workers who may not have previously taken collective action in the workplace. This fall, the Workers Lab will be hosting community convenings across the county to start that conversation.\n•      Worker Defense Project: The Worker Defense Project built a coalition of workers, advocates, and businesses supporting a voluntary program, Better Builder, for real estate developers, public institutions, and companies that commit to investing in good and safe working conditions for construction workers. The coalition pioneered the innovative strategy of seeking an expedited permitting process for those builders willing to adopt those standards. On September 1, 2016, that strategy was successful, and the Austin City Council passed a proposal granting developers expedited building permits in exchange for paying higher wages, providing workers' compensation, offering safety training, and other worker protections.\nBUILDING ON A RECORD OF SUPPORTING WORKING FAMILIES\nFrom the very earliest days in 2009, President Obama and his Administration have taken a number of actions to expand worker voice and bargaining power, including:\n•      Requiring Contractors to Notify Employees of Their Collective Action Rights. Within a month of taking office, President Obama signed Executive Order 13496, requiring that federal contractors post written notice of their employees' rights under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), including the rights to organize and bargaining collectively and to engage in other protected concerted activity. As the Executive Order recognizes, \"productivity is enhanced when workers are well informed of their rights under Federal labor laws,\" so relying on workers who are aware of their rights facilitates the efficient and economical completion of the Federal contracts.\n•      Prohibiting the Use of Federal Dollars for Union Avoidance. Also during his first month in office, the President signed the Economy in Government Contracting Executive Order, which prohibits contractors from spending federal money on union avoidance. The Executive Order provides that expenditures on employers' efforts to persuade employees whether or how to exercise their right to organize and bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing will be considered unallowable costs, including expenditures on union-avoidance consultants. The executive order further specifies that the cost of planning or conducting such activities during work time is an unallowable cost.\n•      Granting Collective Bargaining Rights for TSA Employees. In February 2011, the Administration granted approximately 45,000 Transportation Security Administration (TSA) employees the right to bargain collectively. These employees, who screen airline passengers and baggage, had not previously had collective bargaining rights. As TSA Administrator John Pistole said at the time of the announcement, \"employee engagement cannot be separated from achieving superior security.\"\n•      Protecting Employees' Right to Talk About Their Pay. In April 2014, the President signed Executive Order 13665, protecting the employees of federal contractors when they talk openly about their pay, an important part of having a voice at work. The Executive Order prohibits federal contractors from discharging or discriminating in any way against employees or job applicants who inquire about, discuss, or disclose their own or others' compensation. On September 10, 2015, the Department of Labor finalized rules implementing the order.\n•      Enhancing Workplace Flexibility for Federal Employees. In June 2014, the President issued a memorandum on enhancing workplace flexibility for federal employees. The memorandum directs federal agencies to notify workers of their right to request flexible work schedules and to expand access to such schedules. This policy is an important step forward in giving workers a voice regarding their own working conditions and will help the federal government \"attract, empower, and retain a talented and productive workforce in the 21st century.\"\n•      Promoting Contractors' Compliance with Existing Worker Voice Protections. In July 2014, President Obama signed the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive Order. It requires prospective federal contractors to disclose labor law violations and gives agencies more guidance on how to consider labor violations when awarding federal contracts. This will mean greater protection for collective action by workers under the NLRA, as well as greater protection from retaliation when workers speak up for their rights to equal opportunity, minimum wage and overtime pay, safe workplaces, and family and medical leave.\n•      Vetoing Congressional Resolution of Disapproval of NLRB Election Rules. In March of 2015, President Obama turned back efforts by Republicans in Congress to throw out the National Labor Relations Board's common sense revisions to the NLRA election rules. These rules put in place a more efficient, streamlined process for workers to express their choice whether or not to be represented by a union in their workplace.", "timestamp": "2016-10-28", "title": "Fact Sheet: Strengthening Americans' Voice in the Workplace"}
{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "note": "Remarks as delivered.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=123519", "text": "Thank you. [applause]\nThank you very much. [applause]\nWe love New Hampshire, I can tell you that. [applause]\nI need to open with a very critical breaking news announcement. [applause]\nThe FBI has just sent a letter to Congress informing them that they have discovered new e-mails pertaining to the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's investigation\nAudience: Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!\nAnd they are reopening her case into her criminal and illegal conduct that threatens the security of the United States of America. [applause]\nHillary Clinton's corruption is on a scale we have never seen before. We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office. I have great respect for the fact that the FBI and the Department of Justice are now willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made. [applause]\nThis was a grave miscarriage of justice that the American people fully understood. And it is everybody's hope that it is about to be corrected. [applause]\nSo that is a big announcement that I heard 10 minutes ago and I guess obviously most of you folks have heard about, and in all fairness for all of the people that have suffered for doing so much less, including just recently four-star General James Cartwright, General Petraeus and many others. Perhaps finally justice will be done. [applause]\nWith that being said, the rest of my speech is going to be so boring. Should I even make the speech? We will talk about borders, right? We will talk about trade. We'll bring back our jobs, we'll strengthen our military and let's get going, OK? [applause]\nI want to thank General Flynn, he's a great general and I want to thank you for being here, General. Thank you very much. Just before General Flynn was going up we heard this news. I said, \"General get up there and keep them busy. We want to digest what just happened here.\" Thank you General.\nIn 11 days we are going to win New Hampshire [applause] the state of my first victory. And we are going to win back the White House. [applause]\nSeventy-five percent of the American people think our country is on the wrong track and we are going to fix it. We are going to get our country back on the right track, and very, very quickly. Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare [applause]\nWe can't forget how big a news that is, we can't lose track. It's a disaster, just like everything else in this administration.\nIt has just been announced that Americans are going to experience another massive double-digit hike in Obamacare premiums, including a 116 percent premium hike to our very good friends in the great state of Arizona.\nEven Bill Clinton admitted Obamacare is the craziest thing in the world, where people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half.\nIn Minnesota, where the premium increase will be almost 60 percent, the Democratic governor said the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable. Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare [booing] admitted it was all a fraud and he said it was passed because of the stupidity of the American voter. Hey, we're doing a lot of good work, aren't we? We're catching all of these people. We're doing a good job. Jonathan Gruber, there's another. See, we didn't forget. I never forgot Jonathan Gruber.\nI said you know, if I do this, we're going to run and his name came up and people forget after a week or two. I said I am never going to forget Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare and what he said. So we did not forget. Almost can you imagine, it's like a little more than a week before the election. We didn't forget the name Jonathan Gruber.\nBut the only real stupidity is that shown by our politicians who passed this monstrosity over the furious objection of certain politicians and the American voter. Job-killing Obamacare is just one more way the system is rigged. What I've just announced previously it might not be as rigged as I thought. Right? Right? [applause]\nThe FBI I think they're going to right the ship, folks. I think they're going to right the ship. [applause]\nAnd they're going to save their reputation by doing so.\nHillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare, destroying American health care forever. She wants to expand Obamacare and make it even more expensive. I will repeal and replace Obamacare and we will replace it with a much less expensive plan and a plan that is much, much better. [applause]\nJust this year, Hillary Clinton declared Obamacare is one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, the Democratic Party and our country. Well, that was that's turned out to be wrong. Do they do anything right? We don't win anymore. We don't I mean, you're going to have such a good time starting in '17. We're going to start winning again. We're going to start winning again. [applause]\nBecause it's turned out, and I've been saying this from before it passed, Obamacare is a catastrophe beyond imagination. Insurers are leaving, doctors are quitting, companies are fleeing, workers' hours are being cut, part-time jobs are all over the place. Those beautiful full-time jobs that you used to have don't exist and deductibles are through the roof. You don't get to use it. We don't get rid of Obamacare, we have no choice. But if we don't get rid of it, our health care system is gone forever. We'll never have another chance.\nAnd by the way, if we don't win this election, you're never going to have another chance either, that I can tell you. Never going to happen again. Repealing Obamacare is one of the single most important reasons we must win on November 8th. [applause]\nBut real change also means getting rid of the corruption in Washington, and again, maybe that's happened. Wow. We have a big day. [applause]\nNo think of it, I won my first primary in New Hampshire and I am getting here and the news this morning is this is bigger than Watergate. This is bigger than Watergate in my opinion. This is bigger than Watergate [applause]\nHillary bleached and deleted 33,000 e-mails after receiving a congressional subpoena. That alone to me there were more serious things done, but how does it get much more? But that was so obvious. She gets the subpoena and she bleaches and deletes 33,000 e-mails. That to me because it was so simple, you know? Not it's not about the sale of the uranium that nobody knows what it means I know what it means to Russia. Then she talks to me about Russia. 20 percent of the uranium in our country to Russia.\nBut you know, the deletion of 33,000 e-mails, boy, that just sort of is so out there, after receiving a subpoena from the United States government. She lied to Congress, she lied to the FBI, she made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer. The Clinton crew gave more than $675,000 to the wife of the deputy director of the FBI [booing] and the man who was overseeing the investigation into Hillary's illegal server, but maybe that takes care of itself. Right now that takes care of itself I think, I think. Very proud that the FBI was willing to do this actually, really, very proud. [applause]\nJust yesterday we learned that Bill Clinton's right-hand man pushed for Clinton's foundation donors and other large corporations to funnel as much as $66 million in personal profit to Bill and Hillary Clinton.\nThis man explained that the cozy relationship between his consulting firm to foundation and Clinton's personal income had helped Bill and Hillary enrich themselves, and obtain in-kind services, including personal travel, hospitality, vacations, and the like. [booing]\nThe same people paying Bill Clinton for speeches were lobbying Hillary Clinton at the same the same time, same time. [booing]\nAnd these people are seriously corrupt. [booing]\nTerribly conflict. Hillary's pay for play included defense contracts. Take Raytheon, when the contractor wanted big foreign arms deals, they hired three lobbyists that raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for Hillary's last campaign, and are raising money for her current campaign.\nAnd by the way 50 to 1 in ads, 50 to 1. And if you look at Florida, we're winning. Ohio, we're winning. Iowa we're winning. [applause]\nDoing great in New Hampshire. I think we're going to have a tremendous victory in Pennsylvania. [applause]\nWe better have a great victory in New Hampshire, please. OK, we will. [applause]\nIn fact when this news when this news of the FBI's investigation, when it just happened a little while ago, they said Mr. Trump, I think they'd understand, we could skip your speech in New Hampshire this is so big. I said I don't have the courage to skip the speech in New Hampshire. Believe me, I don't have the courage. [applause]\nI'm not skipping New Hampshire, I never will. You know, when I won, and you remember because I go around and we had the big rallies, and they said oh, the big rallies will never work in New Hampshire, you have to sit down and have dinner with everybody. I said that's like that's a lot of dinners. They don't expect that.\nBut you remember when we met, and I'd have a lot of small meetings too with people, we'd talk, and New Hampshire more than any other place taught me about drugs flowing into this country. And your police department, so great, the police departments in New Hampshire, they told me. I went to some, I became friendly with some. [applause]\nAnd I never knew I never knew, honestly, I knew it was bad, I never knew it was so bad. And I said to the people of New Hampshire, because more than any other place, you look at the beautiful little roadways and lakes and streams, and everything is so beautiful, the trees, and you say how could they have a drug problem here? It doesn't fit.\nBut I'd sit down with groups, and I said what's your biggest problem? And I figured they'd say maybe the veterans which are suffering greatly in this area, we understand that. But it was always -- and we'll solve that problem. But it was always, you know what, it was always heroine. I'd say heroine? What do you mean? And I learned so much. And I said to the people of New Hampshire that if I win, which I did with New Hampshire, if I win, and I also said and if I go all the way, we are going to stop the inflow of drugs into New Hampshire and into our country 100 percent [applause]\nAnd I gave the people of New Hampshire my pledge, more than anybody else in this case, because they really taught me about what's happening with the world of drugs pouring in. Hard to believe. It's just so, so strange when you look and see the beauty of this place and then you see that heroin and drugs are your number one problem, by far.\nAnyway, with months these lobbyists sealed over $26 billion in foreign arms deals, including over $19 billion in Qatar, some people would say Qatar, which happened to be off Bill Clinton. $1 million as a birthday gift for a few minutes of face time. $1 million. The lobbyists, one of whom was the sister-in-law to Hillary Clinton's current campaign chairman, received hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees, the contractor got billions of dollars in contracts, and Hillary Clinton got her campaign cash and money for her foundation.\nAnd you know I'm putting up tremendous amounts of money. Today I wrote another check for $10 million. I'm spending money like crazy. I'll probably have over maybe close to or over $100 million of my money spent on the campaign. But there's something nice about that. Unless I lose, in which case I say, \"What was that all about?\" But we're gonna do what's right for you, not what's right for some contributor or special interest. [applause]\nHillary put the office of the secretary of state up for sale and if she ever got the chance, believe me she would put the office and you know what office I'm talking about the office called the Oval Office up for sale too. I propose a contract with the American voter which will end corruption and give government back to our great people. I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and heed the words I'm about to say, and I never loved this expression but now I love it because it's become it's become the hottest expression. If we win on November 8th, we are going to Washington, D.C. when we win, OK and we are going to drain the swamp. [applause]\nAt the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs. You've been suffering with the jobs. The jobs have gone like candy being taken from a baby. New growth numbers just released put the average growth rate for this year at a disastrous 1.5 percent. If China goes down to 7 or 8 percent GDP, you know it's like a national catastrophe. Last quarter we were at 1 percent. Our job numbers last week were horrible. They were anemic, as the expression goes. They like to say anemic, that was the word they used. Obama is the first president in modern history not to have a single year of 3 percent growth.\nAnd they say it's hard because we're a large county. Well India is a much larger country and they're at 8 percent. China is at 7 percent. And China's not happy. So we're at around 1 percent and we just keep going along, just keep going along losing our jobs to Mexico and every other place. Forty-seven million Americans are on food stamps, and 45 million people think of it, this is our country are living in poverty.\nMeanwhile our trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 billion a year. You say, \"Who negotiates these contracts?\" We're living through Obama. It's true. You know instead of campaigning for Hillary Clinton he ought to be in the White House in the Oval Office negotiating trade deals, beating ISIS, taking care of our veterans which he does not do. We're living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. They're stealing our jobs. Greatest in the history of the world.\nNew Hampshire has lost one in three manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported strongly by Hillary. We've lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization, another Bill and Hillary disaster.\nThe Trump administration will immediately begin negotiating and we will start this negotiation so fast. We will start a negotiation on NAFTA, and if we don't get the deal we want, we will terminate NAFTA and get a much, much better trade deal. [applause]\nAnd I won't go into the details, but because they're different tax systems, they're under a VAT system and we're under our system, but because of the fact that they're under a much different tax system, the day the deal was signed it was a defective deal, with us having a massive, at least 17 percent disadvantage.\nSo it's complicated. I'm not going to bother you or bore you with it, but we've been working with a defective deal for years, and nobody, no politician ever went back to renegotiate it. We're going to get it done, folks, so easily. [applause]\nIf a company wants to fire their workers and go to Mexico or another country and then they think they're going to ship their products back into the United States, we will charge them a tax of 35 percent. [applause]\nSo when you think these companies, which right now are out there negotiating to leave here, they'll leave New Hampshire, they'll leave Pennsylvania, they're gonna leave Ohio, they're gonna leave all of these places, all of our great places and great states. And right now as we're talking, they're negotiating deals.\nMexico is the eighth wonder of the world in terms of the new plants. A friend of mine, Bill Plante, he's the biggest, he said the eighth wonder of the world what's happening in Mexico. And I say, and I tell this to people, what about us? He said meh, not gonna be it's gonna be the other way around. [applause]\nBut there will be consequences. And you know, when they realize that they've got to now pay a tax, all of that, to come through our very strong border, because there will be a strong border [applause] with their product, you know what they're gonna say? They're gonna say let's say, we're not gonna move, and they're gonna stay. It's very simple. But the politicians don't want to do that because they're controlled they're controlled by the people that give them their campaign contributions and probably other things. We will does anybody know what I mean by that? [applause]\nWe will also stand up to Chinese currency manipulation and we will stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership. [applause]\nWe will become a rich nation again, but to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation. Hillary Clinton unleashed ISIS onto the world and it has now spread into our country. There are right now 1,000 open ISIS investigations across the United States, more than at any time that we've ever had. Now, Hillary wants to increase by 550 percent [booing] the massive number of Syrian refugees flowing into our country. That's over the Obama numbers, and those are thousands and thousands of people. A Trump administration will suspend the Syrian refugee program. [applause]\nAnd we'll help them will safe havens and we'll get other countries over there, like the Gulf states who have nothing but money, we have $20 trillion in debt. We'll get them to pay, they gotta do their share. We'll lead it, we'll help, they'll pay, but you know what? We can't let people into this country that we don't know about we don't know. [applause]\nLet me state this as clearly as I can. If I'm elected president, I am going to keep [applause]\nWhen... [applause]\nWe love New Hampshire, I love this place. I love this place. By the way, you know, we're leading in Florida, we're leading in all these places. The recent poll said we're two down in New Hampshire. You know what I said? I don't think so, I don't think so. [applause]\nThese polls, these polls, these are called dirty polls, you know what that is? These are false. I don't think so. She comes up here, she has four people, and it's like oh, we have a wonderful crowd. I don't think so. I think we're winning New Hampshire big.\nOK. So we'll change it. When I'm elected president [applause]\nI am going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. [applause]\nA Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. Boy, you people have energy, you're great. [applause]\nWell, let's face it, it's been a long time, right? It's been a long time. You've been waiting a long time for the right person, but you do have energy.\nYou know what's happening? A lot of these places\nA lot of the different places, reports are coming out. They hate to write it, you know the dishonest media. [booing]\nBut people by the way, great people, oh they're the worst, they're so dishonest. They are so dishonest, folks. But a lot of these reports coming out in the early voting states, people are coming up that have never voted. These are great Americans, these are great people, but they've just never seen anybody that they wanted to like they've never heard people say we're going to actually bring back your jobs. We're not going to let companies leave us and fire everybody and move and then let the product pour into our country with no tax.\nNo, no, just go ahead, leave, fire all our people, move to Mexico, make the product, sell your air conditioners Carrier's an example, they're leaving they might not leave, they're probably all about ready to change their mind. But just let your product come right in, no tax, no nothing. I mean, how stupid is this? How stupid?\nAnd I'm a free-trader, I'm a fair trader. But we have the wrong people represent us. So what's happening is these lines in Florida are four blocks long. They were never like that. They've never seen anything like it. And in Tennessee, a great congressman, been there for 25 years, said to me, \"I've never seen we have never seen anything like it.\" [applause]\nPeople are coming out that haven't voted in years. People are coming out, they literally they hadn't voted in years. So they're not polled because, you know, unless you voted like in the last election, they don't want to poll you. So, people are coming out that hadn't voted in years. Happening in Texas. They haven't voted in years.\nAnd people that have never even voted, and yet they're great Americans. They just never saw somebody that they wanted to vote for. And they're coming out and they've got the Trump shirt and they've got the hat, they've got buttons all over the place, you know. [applause]\nNow, who knows who knows? They may have all of the Trump stuff and you never know. Maybe they're voting for crooked Hillary Clinton, but I don't think so, right? I don't think so. [booing]\nHistory has taught us that we don't think so. So, I think we're doing great.\nAnd yes, on the border, we have no choice, we will build a wall and Mexico will pay for the wall. Got to stop the drugs. [applause]\nGot to stop the drugs. Remember my pledge to everybody but in particular to New Hampshire, because I know what you're going through with the drugs. I know what your incredible law enforcement, your police and your fire departments, because I see where they're helping so much. Believe me, they're they're not spoken about.\nAnd how about where they're shooting? During fires, they're shooting at the firemen. Now, this is a new phenomenon. They're shooting at firemen. They're shooting bullets at firemen going to fires and fighting fires. So we have a divided country and we're going to make our country love again. We're going to bring it like this room. [applause]\nCountless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this administration. This includes incredible Americans like 21-year-old Sarah Root. You've heard that story, you've seen it, you've read about it.\nThe man who killed her arrived at the border, entered federal custody and then was released into the United States community under the policies of this White House. He was released again and again, after crime after crime and now is at large. Sarah graduated from college just the day before with a 4.0 grade point average, top in her class. She was violently, violently killed. Outstanding young woman. I know her parents; they're incredible.\nAlso among the victims of Obama-Clinton open borders policy was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21-year-old convenience store clerk in Mesa, Arizona. He was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary who had also been released from federal custody. And so many people said please, please, please don't release him, he's violent. And he shot Grant through the head.\nAnother victim who we've all read about and known about, Kate Steinle, gunned down in the sanctuary city of San Francisco by an illegal immigrant. [booing]\nAnd this person was deported five previous times. And now, he's got a good lawyer and the case will go on and on and on. He's got a lawyer, I see them in court all the time. The case will go on and on. Shot in the back while standing with her father. Great parents, great brother.\nThen there is the case of 90-year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home. The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records a mile long but who did not meet the Obama administration's priorities for removal. People begged that they be incarcerated or be moved out of the country, but our geniuses wouldn't listen.\nIn California, a 64-year-old Air Force veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer. Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions but was never deported. People asked please, please deport him. This is what happened. This is a crime wave that never ends. I can tell you it's thousands of cases like this.\nWhen I'm president, believe me, it will end. [applause]\nNot only will a wall keep out the dangerous cartels and criminals, but will also keep out the drugs, remember New Hampshire, and the heroin poisoning our youth. Our youth is being poisoned before they get a chance [applause]\nAnd by the way, I've met plenty of people in New Hampshire that are not our youth that have a tremendous problem, and I want to tell you, we're going to work with people, we're going to set up programs, we're going to try everything we can to get them unaddicted, unaddicted. [applause]\nSo as I said, when I won the New Hampshire primary, I promised the people of New Hampshire that we would stop drugs from pouring into your community and I guarantee you we will. You will be so proud of your president, you will be so proud of your community. [applause]\nYou will be so proud.\nI just want to say in closing I just want to say in closing that we have an amazing movement going on. A movement like they've never seen before, a movement that hopefully won't be stopped. We have a movement that the biggest people in the world of the media, the biggest, have said they've never seen anything like it before. Every every crowd, every auditorium.\nThe other night, we had a situation. We had thousands and thousands of people and I said to the fire marshal, isn't it possible to let more in? We had thousands of people in this massive field and we had many thousands outside of the gates they wouldn't let in and I said, couldn't we let them in? And they said, we can't. I said, but there's no fire, we're outside. He said, it's stampede, Mr. Trump, we're worried about a stampede.\nAnd it's a stampede of love. It's true. It's not a stampede it's a stampede of love. [applause]\nBecause there was so many people. They said we have very strong security guards, but Mr. Trump, they're not nearly strong as 45,000 people come charging forward. So I fully understood it. But we have something going on that's so special. It's so special. We're going to reduce your taxes, we're going to simplify your taxes. We're going to make your businesses welcome in our country. [applause]\nWe're going to reduce the taxes for middle-income people. We call them the forgotten men and women. Greatly simplify your returns. The only company that I can think of that won't like us is H&R Block, they will not like us.\nThey're not gonna like Trump too much.\nBut we'll greatly simplify your taxes. And your businesses we're taking it from 35 percent, which is one of the highest in the world, just about the highest, down to one of the lowest in the world, 15 percent. [applause]\nWe're getting rid of a lot of the regulations that are stopping growth. Tremendous amounts of regulation are killing your small businesses and your big businesses. So we're gonna have a very tax- friendly country again, and it's gonna mean jobs, it's gonna mean expansion, it's gonna mean new companies growing.\nWe are going to create the border. We are going to stop the drugs. We're gonna have people come into our country. We want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally. They have to come in through a legal process. We want a lot of people to come in. [applause]\nAnd they're going to come in, but they'll come in legally. And we're gonna streamline the process. People are waiting on line now 10 years. We're gonna streamline because we want people to come in, but we want them to come in legally. And we want merit, too. We want to take wonderful, great people that love our country, they want to get out and they want to do a great job. We want to have them also come in based on merit. A word you don't hear anymore. A word you don't hear any more. It's too bad.\nWe're also going to very importantly appoint justices to the Supreme Court [applause]\nWho you can be proud of and who will respect the Constitution of the United States. [applause]\nWe're going to save our Second Amendment, which is under unbelievable siege. [applause]\nWe're going to help big league on education, we're going to go with choice, so important, and we're going to terminate Common Core and bring education local. [applause]\nOur military is depleted. We're going to rebuild our military. We are going to lead through strength. [applause]\nAnd hopefully, we're not gonna have to use our military but I will say this. We're getting rid of ISIS. We're getting rid of ISIS. [applause]\nISIS is we have no choice. By the way, not since medieval times has anyone seen chopping off of heads, drowning in steel cages, burying in sand. Not since not since medieval times. It all grew during the tenure of Obama and Hillary Clinton.\nISIS you know she stands up and she says what she's gonna do. Well, she was there. It came out of the vacuum because we should have never gone into Iraq, but once we did, we should have gone out the right way, not the wrong way. And the way they went out was so bad, so bad, including giving back Mosul, which now they're fighting to take back. And it would have been nice the element of surprise. Do we agree? Does anybody not agree? [applause]\nThe element of surprise. We don't use the element of surprise. We use the element of tell them everything we can possibly tell them, give them plenty of time to get ready and then attack. And it turns out to be a lot tougher than they ever thought.\nBut we're going to have a country that you're going to be proud of again. We're going to have a president that hopefully you will be proud of. [applause]\nI will work so hard for every community. I'll be working very hard for the African-American community, for the Hispanic community. I'll be working hard for every community. And we're gonna have this divided nation come together. And I just want to say we're gonna make America strong again, we're gonna make America doesn't sound nice, but we have no choice wealthy again. [applause]\nBut we are going to make America great again. [applause]\nAnd I want to thank everybody in New Hampshire. Get out and vote. You're very special people. You're very, very special people. God bless you, get out and vote. [applause]\nThank you. Thank you, New Hampshire. [applause]", "timestamp": "2016-10-28", "title": "Remarks at Radisson Armory in Manchester, New Hampshire"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "This proclamation was published in the  Federal Register  on November 2.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119540", "text": "By the President of the United States of America\nA Proclamation\nIn America, all people deserve an equal chance to succeed, and expanding access to affordable higher education is necessary for bringing us closer to fulfilling this ideal. Over the past several generations, our country built a strong middle class through a commitment to keeping a high-quality education within reach for all those willing to work for it, and now more than ever, a college degree is the surest path to the middle class. During National College Application Month, we encourage Americans to apply for a higher education, and we strive to ensure every student—no matter who they are or where they come from—has a chance at the opportunities they need to thrive.\nMy Administration is committed to giving students and their families important information on college admissions, value, and costs so they can make decisions that are right for them. Last year, we redesigned a new College Scorecard with direct input from students, families, and advisers to provide clear and accessible national data on college cost, graduation rates, debt, and post-college earnings. By visiting CollegeScorecard.Ed.gov, more Americans can evaluate college choices based on the factors that matter most to them. Through First Lady Michelle Obama's Reach Higher initiative, we are inspiring more students to pursue a higher education, ensuring they have what they need to complete their college education, and helping them understand their financial aid eligibility. And we are working to reduce barriers to educational opportunity through the Fair Chance Higher Education Pledge—an effort in which public and private colleges and universities are helping provide individuals with criminal records who have already paid their debt to society a fair chance to seek a higher education. To learn more about ways we are helping more Americans pursue a higher education, visit www.WhiteHouse.gov/ReachHigher.\nAlthough earning a college degree is one of the most important investments individuals can make for themselves and for our country, it still feels out of reach for too many American families. That is why we have taken many steps to make college more affordable, including doubling investments in grant and scholarship aid through Pell Grants and tax credits, keeping interest rates low on Federal student loans, and helping borrowers manage debt after college through programs like the Pay as You Earn plan. This year, we launched the Free Application for Federal Student Aid—which is available at www.FAFSA.gov—3 months earlier than usual so that students can access financial aid sooner and receive better information as they search for and apply to colleges. And because every American at any age and from any walk of life should be able to earn the skills necessary to compete in the 21st-century economy, I have proposed making community college free for students with the drive and discipline to work for it.\nThis month, we recognize the limitless potential in every student and reaffirm our commitment to offering them the resources they need to succeed. We thank not only the teachers, counselors, and parents who support students throughout the college application process, but also the organizations and institutions partnering with us to eliminate unnecessary barriers to higher education. Let us celebrate the progress we have made as more historically underserved students are enrolling in college for the first time, more students are graduating from college than ever before, and new student loan defaults are on the decline. And together, let us forge a future where every student has the opportunity to go as far as their dreams and hard work will take them.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2016 as National College Application Month. I call upon public officials, educators, parents, students, and all Americans to observe this month with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs designed to encourage students to make plans for and apply to college.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-10-28", "title": "Proclamation 9531—National College Application Month, 2016"}

Although the rate of new cases is falling, the numbers are still alarming. Diabetes is one of the leading causes of death in the United States and results in staggering health and financial costs for Americans. With a concentrated effort to reduce the number of new diagnoses and improve treatment and care for those living with this disease, we must continue making progress in the battle against this epidemic. Each year during National Diabetes Month, we resolve to support everyone battling this chronic disease, and we recommit to fighting it so that more Americans can lead a healthy life.\nDiabetes can affect individuals of any age, gender, or background depending on risk factors, which can include a combination of genetics and lifestyle. Type 1 diabetes, often diagnosed in youth, affects people whose bodies do not produce enough insulin, a hormone needed to live. Type 2 diabetes occurs in people who are not able to produce enough insulin to meet their body's needs, and typically develops in adults—however, more young people today are being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes than ever before, and it is more commonly diagnosed among those who are obese or inactive. Both types can lead to health problems such as heart disease, blindness, and kidney failure. Additionally, roughly one-third of American adults have prediabetes—a condition in which their blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to be diagnosed with diabetes—placing them at higher risk for other health conditions or for developing type 2 diabetes. Another form of diabetes, known as gestational diabetes, can develop in pregnant women, create complications during pregnancy, and increase chances of developing type 2 diabetes later in life for both mothers and their children.\nType 1 diabetes accounts for a smaller proportion of diagnosed cases of diabetes; over 90 percent of all diagnosed cases are type 2 diabetes. Individuals with type 1 diabetes need to monitor their blood sugar levels and take insulin every day to survive. Diabetes has no cure, but people with type 2 diabetes can manage their disease by following a healthy meal plan, increasing physical activity, taking prescribed medications, and quitting smoking if applicable. For individuals with prediabetes or overweight individuals at higher risk of diabetes, losing weight through healthy eating and regular physical activity can help prevent or delay type 2 diabetes. Americans with any type of diabetes should get regular checkups and work with health care professionals to learn more about this disease. Individuals at higher risk—particularly those who are overweight, older than 45, or have a family history of type 2 diabetes—should talk to their health care providers about their diabetes risk. African Americans, Hispanic Americans, American Indians, Asian Americans, and Pacific Islanders are also at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. I encourage all Americans to visit www.NDEP.NIH.gov to find resources available through the National Diabetes Education Program to help make and sustain healthy lifestyle and behavior changes.\nOver the last 8 years, my Administration has worked to provide better care, prevention, and treatment for anyone suffering from diabetes. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has required that insurers cover preventive services such as certain diabetes screenings without copays or deductibles, and seniors can now receive these screenings free of charge as well. Insurance companies can no longer deny individuals coverage because of a pre-existing condition, including a family history of diabetes, and children can now stay on a parent's health insurance plan until age 26. By supporting the Diabetes Prevention Program—the first preventive service model eligible for expansion under Medicare—the ACA has improved the quality of care, reduced health care costs, and helped prevent the onset of diabetes.\nNearly one in three American children is overweight or obese, causing a rise in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes among children. Unless we act, approximately one-third of all children born since the turn of the century will suffer from diabetes during their lifetimes. The First Lady's Let's Move! initiative has worked to reverse this childhood obesity trend and put children on a path to a healthy future during their earliest years by fostering environments that support healthy choices; promoting physical activity; providing healthier foods in our schools; and ensuring families have access to nutritious, affordable foods and the information they need to make healthy choices. We have also harnessed the American spirit of innovation through our Precision Medicine Initiative: By tailoring treatments to individuals based on personalized information such as genetics, we can move closer to curing diseases like diabetes and give more Americans the opportunity to live full, healthy lives.\nEvery year, too many Americans experience the consequences of diabetes—but in part because of the dedication of our Nation's health care providers, researchers, and advocates, we have made important strides in combating this disease, and we have reason to hope this progress will continue. This month, let us work to show every individual living with diabetes that they are not alone, and let us continue strengthening our investment in the fight against this disease.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2016 as National Diabetes Month. I call upon all Americans, school systems, government agencies, nonprofit organizations, health care providers, research institutions, and other interested groups to join in activities that raise diabetes awareness and help prevent, treat, and manage the disease.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-10-28", "title": "Proclamation 9532—National Diabetes Month, 2016"}

Hello, Orlando! I said, hello, Orlando! Hello, UCF! Go Knights!\nI understand you play Houston this weekend. You guys feeling all right?\nAudience members. Yes!\nThe President. Are you fired up? Are you ready to go? Oh, I'm fired up. Look at this crowd.\nTo every—I think it's being broadcast outside the auditorium, everybody who couldn't get in because we ended up being a little too packed and the fire marshal had to close things off. I just wanted you to know if you're outside, I love you too!\nCan everybody please give Devi a big round of applause for that great introduction? She's the kind of young lady that makes us proud. Couple other people I want to acknowledge—your outstanding mayor, Buddy Dyer, is in the house. Your wonderful senior Senator, Bill Nelson, is here. Your next Members of Congress, former Governor Charlie Crist, Val Demings, Stephanie Murphy, Darren Soto. Your next United States Senator, Patrick Murphy. And all of you are here.\nAnd I am here to say thank you. I want to say thank you, because it has been——\nAudience member. We love you!\nThe President. I love you back! I do! You know, it has been——\nAudience members. Obama! Obama! Obama!\nThe President. It has been a privilege of a lifetime to serve as your President. And Michelle and I could not be more grateful for your support and your prayers over all these years. But, but—hold up, hold up—[laughter]—but we're not done yet. I've got one campaign left in me.\nMichelle and I got a little more work to do. So I'm here today, Florida, to ask you to work hard, as you did for me, to make sure that Hillary Clinton is the next President of the United States of America.\nI didn't see the band back there. What's going on, band? Sorry, but I just love marching bands, so I had to acknowledge the marching band. Are you guys from—you're not from the college, you're from high school, right? Where you from?\nOcoee High School Marching Band members. [Inaudible]\nThe President. What did they say? High school?\nMarching Band members. Ocoee!\nThe President. There you go. Ocoee. All right, Ocoee, we're proud of you.\nNow, where was I? Listen, hold on, hold on. You guys are just so excited. Now let me say this. Florida is always a battleground State. Florida is just a big, diverse State, which means that the races in Florida are always close. I remember when I was campaigning here in the closing days of another hard-fought campaign 8 years ago, and some of you were only 4, so—[laughter].\nBut if you will recall, we were going through two long wars, we were in the early days of the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes. On everything from health care to climate change to criminal justice issues, we had just been kicking the can down the road for way too long. And I said at that time that I wasn't a perfect man, I wouldn't be a perfect President. I said at the time that if you elected me, we wouldn't solve every problem on day one. We wouldn't solve it all in 1 year, or one term, or even in one Presidency.\nBut what I told you was that I would work as hard as I could every single day to do right by you. That every day, when I walked into that Oval Office, I'd be thinking about the folks I met on the campaign trail. I'd be thinking about the students who were trying to get a good education without a ton of debt. I'd be thinking about the working families who were trying to figure out how to pay the bills, and maybe they had lost their homes or they had lost their pensions because of the economic crisis. I told you that I would be thinking about folks who didn't have health care and were worried about how they were going to make sure that somebody in their family that they loved got treated fairly.\nAnd I will tell you this: I've made mistakes during these 8 years, and there have been times where we've had ups, and there have been times where we have had lows. But I kept that promise to work for you as hard as I could.\nAnd you kept faith with me, and working together, what we've seen is that an America that was at the edge of a depression battled back, and we turned job losses into 15 million new jobs. And last year, incomes went up faster than any time that they've been keeping records. And poverty went down faster than any time since 1968. We just learned this week that the economy grew faster than any time in the last 2 years.\nWe've seen an America that went from too many people uninsured to now 20 million people with health care who didn't have it before. And the lowest uninsured rate in our history.\nWe've seen an America that was hopelessly hooked on foreign oil kick that addiction and suddenly we're producing solar energy and wind energy and fighting to protect our planet by reducing harmful carbon pollution.\nWe've seen our men and women in uniform, the best that there is, sign up to serve and meet every mission: to pursue the terrorists responsible for 9/11; get Usama bin Laden; make sure that justice was served.\nWe've seen a country where freedom was limited in so many places to a situation now, where in every State in this Union, you can marry the person you love.\nWe've increased access to Pell grants. We've seen the highest high school graduation rate in our history. We've seen the biggest jump in college enrollment in our history. Across the board, by almost every measure, we are significantly better off now than we were 8 years ago.\nAnd part of it is because we got policies right, but part of it is because of you. I travel across all 50 States and I have seen what makes America great. I've seen folks working hard, starting their own businesses; teachers reaching into their own pockets to make sure kids get an education. I've seen doctors serving the poor. I've seen our brave men and women in uniform, and our brave police officers and first responders running towards danger and working to keep us safe. I've seen the patriotism of young activists speaking out to make this country better, even if it sometimes makes us uncomfortable, calling on us to live up to our highest ideals.\nI see you, Americans of every party and every faith knowing we are stronger working together—whether we are young or old, or men or women, Black, White, Latino, Asian, Native American, folks with disabilities, gay, straight, it doesn't matter—all pledging allegiance to the red, white, and blue. That's the America I know. That's the America I love.\nThat's why, through all the ups and downs, I haven't been worried about this country. Because I've seen the heart and soul of the American people, and it is good, and it is decent, and it is strong, and it is resilient. And there is only one candidate in this race who I believe can continue the progress we've made. And I know that because she has devoted her life to making America better, and that is the next President of the United States, Hillary Clinton.\nSo I am going to work my heart out over these next 11 days. I don't know about you, but I'm not tired. I'm feeling good. I'm ready to work. And I need you to join me.\nFlorida, I need you to join me. Young people, I need you to join me. And you don't need to wait until November 8 to do the work, because here in Florida, you can vote early. Here in Florida, you can vote right now. And if you turn out to vote—and I want young people to listen here—hold on a second, I'm going to get quiet for a second. Everybody, hold on, hold on. I'm going to talk to young people here for a second.\nIf you vote, if you young people vote, if you vote for somebody who wants to make sure that college is more affordable, if you vote to make sure we're dealing with climate change instead of denying it, if you vote to make sure that we have somebody in the White House who cares about civil rights and cares about making sure everybody has a shot, if you vote, you will send Hillary to the White House—you. You. You will send Patrick Murphy to the United States Senate. It's up to you.\nAnd by the way, for those of you who are not young but just young at heart, don't be offended. See, I've got to speak to the young people because us old heads, we generally vote. [Laughter] Because we've got—you know, because we don't have enough energy to have as much fun as the young people do, so we're not as distracted, so we go to remember to vote. The young people, they've got a lot of stuff going on.\nBut I need you young people to vote. And by the way, the nearest early voting location for Orange County is straight down the road at Alafaya Library. The nearest Seminole County early vote location is right up the road at Oviedo Aquatic Center. And you can find other early voting locations just by going to iwillvote.com.\nSee, but here's the thing, everybody is—you guys are just being so sweet to me and I appreciate it, but understand this, understand this: All the progress we've made over these last 8 years goes out the window if we don't win this election. Health care for 20 million people goes away. The progress we've made on climate change goes away. All the work that we've been doing to make college more affordable goes away. I mean, the stakes could not be higher.\nAnd I understand that right now the polls show Hillary having a lead. And—no, no, no, hold on, hold on. Hold on a minute. [Laughter] Hold on. You know, sometimes when you get a lead, whether it's in sports or in politics, you start feeling good. You start celebrating too early. You start getting turnovers. You start missing some free throws. Suddenly, it gets a little closer. You start tightening up. And next thing you know, you look up, and you let it slip away. See, I don't want y'all feeling too good. I want you hustling all the way until the polls close on November 8. I don't want you taking things for granted. I want you to run through the tape. I don't want you to do an Usain Bolt and kind of look back, all smiling. [Laughter] Because politics isn't like track and field; you're not always as fast as Usain Bolt. You've got to stay focused and run through the tape. We cannot kick back and think that we've got this thing won, because this has been a volatile race. It's been a volatile election. Folks are in a volatile mood.\nAnd the media stories go up and down, and there's a lot of noise, and sometimes it's hard for folks to sort out what's right and what's wrong, what's true, what's false, which is why the other guy can just say whatever he wants, right?\nAnd so we have to work hard. And by the way, that's who Hillary is. Hillary never takes anything for granted. I have worked with Hillary. She works hard every single day. She doesn't take a day off. She is a grinder, she just keeps on working. I've seen it. I have benefited from it. I've seen her in the Situation Room, making the argument to go after bin Laden, even when it was risky.\nI've seen her travel the globe over and over and over again, earning the respect of world leaders. It's not always flashy. People at home don't always see it. Folks like big speeches. Folks like sound bites. She doesn't always get the credit, but she does the work. She does the work. She understands the challenges we face. She knows what she's talking about.\nAnd by the way, when things don't go her way, you don't see her whining. You don't see her complaining. You don't see her saying things were rigged. She just comes back and she gets up and she works harder, and she works harder, and she works harder until she gets done what she's supposed to get done.\nAnd the reason she works so hard is because she cares. She knows about hardships, seeing her mom's history as an orphan. She knows that the decisions that you make in the Presidency are not abstractions. She knows that this isn't just about the game of politics. She knows that what we decide—what I decide and what she would decide as President—means everything to a soldier or a veteran or a military family, to a family that's trying to make ends meet, to the student who is trying to go to college for the first time, for a young person who was brought this—brought to this country as a child and wants to contribute to the only home that she's ever known.\nHillary knows that ordinary people need a champion. And she doesn't just talk the talk, she walks the walk. She's got plans. And she's got details. And she's read them through. And she's thought them through, which is why, when she's in a debate with the other guy, she's talking about stuff that she actually knows something about and the other guy is just making stuff up.\nAnd listen, listen. Can I just say, like, I was a good student when I was in law school and I was a good student my last 2 years in college. But when I was in high school, my first 2 years, I was one of those guys who sometimes just kind of was talking and trying to get in good with the teacher. And I was kind of charming and—but I wasn't always doing my work.\nAnd that's okay for a while, but just like you want a surgeon who has actually studied surgery, just like you want a pilot who did their homework when it comes to flying a plane, you don't want the slacker as your President. You want somebody who is actually going to work hard and do the job. You want somebody who knows what they're talking about. And by the way, you know who is also a hard worker is Patrick Murphy. Patrick Murphy. Unlike his opponent, Marco Rubio, Patrick actually shows up to his job. He puts you ahead of politics. He didn't try to defund Planned Parenthood. He fought to make sure women could make their own health care decisions. He didn't say that he was supportive of Florida's Latino community when—but then, when the politics got tough, you walk away from comprehensive immigration reform. Unlike his opponent, he actually believes in science and that climate change is happening.\nIn a recent debate, Marco Rubio didn't accept that sea levels were rising. Now, he's from Miami. [Laughter] So you can go to Miami and, on a sunny day, you can see a foot of water and if you want, you can put your finger in it. It's salty. [Laughter] It's in the middle of the road. It's a problem. But apparently, what 99 percent of scientists and what your own eyes tell you is not true, from Marco Rubio's perspective. Meanwhile, Patrick Murphy brought Democrats and Republicans together to fund Everglades restoration. He cares about the environment. And as your next Senator, he'll fight alongside Hillary to protect this planet for the next generation.\nAudience members. Patrick! Patrick! Patrick!\nThe President. Patrick! Patrick! Patrick!\nYou know what, there's one other big difference between Patrick and Marco Rubio. Marco Rubio still supports Donald Trump.\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. Don't boo——\nAudience members. Vote!\nThe President. Vote!\nDon't—you know what, I always have to say this: Trump can't hear you boo, but he'll hear your vote. Rubio doesn't care if you boo, but he'll care if you vote.\nYou know what, now, for some voters——\nAudience member. Mr. President!\nThe President. Hello!\nFor some voters, Marco Rubio will say, I think that what Donald Trump said is terrible. And then, in front of other voters, he'll say, well, I'm still supporting Donald Trump. You know what, you can't have it both ways here. This is as cynical as politics gets. You can't just say anything or just pretend to be anybody in order to get elected or stay elected.\nIf you run for office on family values, then you should have been walking away from a nominee months ago who was calling women pigs or dogs or slobs or graded them not on the content of their character, but on a scale of 1 to 10. You can't, with a straight face, say you respect women and then support somebody who brags about assaulting women.\nYou don't have to be a husband, you don't have to be a father to stand up for women. You just have to be a decent person.\nAnd I will tell you that I know everybody has been noticing Michelle has been pretty passionate lately. You know, it's not only is this something Michelle has experienced herself, but this is something that, as parents, when we think about our daughters and listen to that kind of behavior, we say, that is not the kind of example we set for our children, for our boys, for our girls.\nAudience members. Obama! Obama! Obama!\nThe President. Now, obviously, I could go on and on about why I don't think that the Republican nominee is fit to hold this office because he does it himself every time he talks or tweets or gets caught on tape.\nBut I will say this: in my two campaigns for President, I had very strong disagreements with John McCain. I had very strong disagreements with Mitt Romney. I believed I had better ideas than them for how to lead the country. But I was never concerned about the fate of our democracy if they had won.\nAnd Michelle feels the same way. Michelle doesn't love politics. She wasn't thrilled about me going into politics. But she is working as hard as she can because she understands there's something more fundamental at stake than this particular election, and that is, who are we as a country, what is our character, what values do we stand for?\nWe cannot teach our children to treat women as objects. We want to treat—we want to teach our kids to treat everybody as full and equal citizens capable of doing anything. We can't teach our children to vilify immigrants or people with disabilities or Americans who practice a different faith. We've got to teach them that everybody counts and everybody matters and everybody is deserving of respect, and we are stronger together than we could ever be apart.\nWe shouldn't let our kids think that politics is about pitching a new hotel or a new golf course or a TV contract. It's about working on behalf of the common good and promoting opportunity and justice.\nThat's what Hillary believes. That's why she has to win this election. It's at the heart of the Methodist creed her mom instilled in her: Do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways that you can, as long as ever you can.\nThat's why she's in this. She believes, like I believe, that we can summon what's best in each of us; that we can make this country better for all of us. She believes that, together, we can do big things that we could never do on our own.\nAnd isn't that what America is all about? We're a country like no other in the world. We're a country that was founded for the sake of an idea: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that we are endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights.\"\nThat you don't have to be born into wealth or privilege; you don't have to look a certain way; you don't have to have a certain last name. That if you are willing to give of yourself, you can move the wheel of history. That's what drove patriots to choose revolution over tyranny. That's what led GIs to liberate a continent. That's what gave women the courage to reach out for that ballot. That's what led marchers to cross a bridge in Selma. That's what led workers to organize for better wages. That is what has made America exceptional. That is why America is great.\nAnd all that progress, all that work hasn't happened because some person from on high did it for us. It's because we did it together. It's because ordinary people worked hard. It's because immigrant families, like Devi's parents, worked the night shift. They saved and scrimped. They sacrificed. They got involved. They spoke out. And even though sometimes that progress is slow in coming, sometimes it's hard, sometimes it's frustrating; ultimately, that process of self-government moved us forward.\nAnd that's what Hillary understands. That's what she understands. She knows that in a democracy that's big and diverse like this, you can't be demonizing each other all the time. You can't just make stuff up about each other. You can't spend all your time calling each other names. You've got to compromise sometimes, even when you're right. She understands nobody is perfect, not even Presidents. But we should try our best to conduct ourselves with just some basic homespun values: honesty, decency, generosity, big-heartedness, fairness, the things we try to teach our kids, the things most of us should have learned in kindergarten. That's what we should expect.\nLook, I am here to tell you, this—and I'm just going to be honest with you—I understand that this is a polarized country right now. I understand that everybody is just rooting for their side. I understand that so much of the news during this election cycle has been discouraging or cynical. And these days, because of the nature of the Internet and social media, sometimes, it's hard to sort out what's true and what's false.\nI know that so many people can feel cynical sometimes about our prospects for progress and change. And sometimes, it feels like Washington is very far away and very distant. But I'm urging all of you—and I mean this—the choice in this election is really clear. You've got one person who is really, really well qualified, who really, really cares about doing the right thing, who is committed to sustaining the work that you and I have done together over these last 8 years. I believe Hillary Clinton will be a great President.\nI believe she will move this country forward. But she's going to need our help. It's not enough just to elect her and then have a Republican Congress that is already talking about not being willing to cooperate with her on anything. When they controlled the Senate and the House—right now they can't even pass their own stuff. And all we're going to see is more gridlock and more obstruction and more threats to shut down the Government and more threats to wreck the economy. They've given up on their own nominee, but they're promising more unprecedented dysfunction in Washington.\nThey didn't work with me when I took office, even when we were in the middle of a unprecedented crisis. They sure will not work with Hillary now. Some of them are already promising years of investigations and hearings and obstruction and repeal votes. They're already saying they might not appoint a ninth Supreme Court Justice at all. They boast about their refusal to compromise, as if that, in and of itself, is an accomplishment. And all it does is prevent what everybody is looking for, which is fixing up our roads and putting people to work and cleaning up our environment and fixing immigration, educating our kids, keeping them safe.\nIf you think that the slogan, \"Vote for us because we're going to give you gridlock\"—if you think that's a good slogan, then you should vote Republican. [Laughter] But I'm hoping you're not that cynical. I'm hoping you believe America can do better. If you care about creating jobs that families can live on; if you care about childcare they can afford; if you care about equal pay for equal work; if you care about raising the minimum wage; then I need you not just to vote for Hillary, but I need you to vote up and down the ticket. I need you to vote for Patrick Murphy. I need you to vote for our Members of Congress, people who are willing to roll up their sleeves and move this country forward. So, young people, let me say this one more time. I know you may be cynical sometimes and you may be fed up with politics. I know there's a lot of crazy stuff on TV and even crazier stuff on the Internet. But you have the chance right now to reject a divisive, mean-spirited politics that would take us backwards. You have the chance right now to elect a woman—our first female President—who has spent her entire life moving this country forward. You have a chance to shape history, so don't let that chance slip away.\nYou've got to vote. If you've been marching for criminal justice reform, that's great, but you've got to vote for a President and a Congress who cares about reducing the pipeline from underfunded schools to overcrowded jails.\nIf you've been marching for the environment, I hear you, but you've got to have a President and a Congress who believe in science and will protect the progress we've made because they care about the children.\nIf you've been marching for immigration reform, I've heard you, but you've got to vote for a President and a Congress who doesn't consider immigrants rapists and criminals, but as people who love this country and are ready to contribute.\nWhatever issue you care about, you've got to vote. This is where democracy happens. This is not where it ends; it's where it happens, with your vote. Hillary needs your help. I need your help. America needs your help. Because your involvement is how progress is won. What you do is what's ultimately going to matter.\nAnd if you—if you—do everything you can, not just to vote yourselves, but to get your friends out there, your family, your cousins, your uncle, your neighbors, your coworkers—if you tell them this is the moment where America has to take a stand and decide what it is that we believe in and who we are, and we're not going to succumb to cynicism, we're not going to believe in fear, and instead we're going to lift up hope.\nIf you want hope instead of fear, then you will elect Hillary Clinton as President of the United States and Patrick Murphy as Senator. And you will continue what we started 8 years ago and America will continue on this amazing journey, this amazing journey in which every single person in this country has a chance to live out their dreams.\nGod bless you, Florida. God bless you—the United States of America.

In 10 days, we are going to win the state of Arizona and we are going to win back the White House.\nA Trump Administration will immediately repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.\nIt's just been announced that the citizens of Arizona are going to experience a 116 percent increase in their Obamacare premiums. Elect me, and WE WILL STOP THE PREMIUM HIKES FOR GOOD. WE WILL STOP THE MADNESS OF OBAMACARE.\nEvery single one of Arizona's 15 counties is losing insurers next year because of Obamacare. In Phoenix, there are 8 Obamacare insurers this year. Next year there will be only one. And it was announced this week that Obamacare premiums in Phoenix will go up 145% next year. One insurer in the state will have a $14,000 deductible.\nObamacare is a catastrophe for Arizona, and a catastrophe for all of America.\nEven Bill Clinton admitted Obamacare is \"the craziest thing in the world,\" where \"people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half.\"\nIn Minnesota, where the premium increase will be close to 60 percent, the Democratic Governor has said \"the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable.\"\nJonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, admitted it was all a fraud, and he said, outrageously, that it was passed because of the \"stupidity of the American voter.\"\nHillary Clinton wants to double-down on Obamacare, making it even more expensive.\nMy Contract With the American Voter outlines a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare, and I'm asking for your vote so we can save healthcare for every family in Arizona.\nReal change also means getting rid of the corruption in Washington.\nAs you have heard, it was just announced yesterday that the FBI is reopening their investigation into the criminal and illegal conduct of Hillary Clinton.\nThis is the biggest political scandal since Watergate, and it is everybody's deepest hope that justice, at last, can be delivered.\nHillary has nobody but herself to blame for her mounting legal troubles. Her criminal action was willful, deliberate, intentional, and purposeful.\nHillary set-up an illegal server for the obvious purpose of shielding her criminal conduct from public disclosure – and exposure.\nShe set-up this illegal server knowing full well that her actions put our national security at risk, and put the safety and security of your children at risk. But she didn't care – as long as she and Bill got the money, the safety of your family didn't matter.\nTo cover-up her crimes, she bleached and deleted 33,000 emails after receiving a Congressional Subpoena, made 13 phones disappear – some with a hammer, lied to Congress under oath, lied to the FBI many times, and then two boxes of email evidence went mysteriously missing.\nThe WikiLeaks revelations have exposed criminal corruption at the highest levels of our government.\nHillary put the office of Secretary of State up for sale and, if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too. She'd put it up for sale to special interests and foreign dictators – whoever offers the highest price.\nYet, now it's reported that the Department of Justice is fighting the FBI – that's because the Department of Justice is trying to protect Hillary Clinton.\n97% of Department of Justice employee's presidential contributions went to Hillary Clinton.\nThere are those, and I happen to be one of them, who think Hillary offered Lorretta Lynch a reappointment as Attorney General if she were to become President. Perhaps that was what Bill Clinton was arranging when he met with Attorney General Lynch on her airplane on the tarmac right here in Arizona.\nThis is what we mean when we say the system is rigged.\nA vote for Hillary is a vote to surrender our government to public corruption, graft and cronyism that threatens the survival of our Constitutional system itself.\nWhat makes us exceptional is that we are a nation of laws, and that we are all equal under those laws – Hillary's corruption shreds the principle on which our nation was founded.\nGovernment corruption spreads outward, like a cancer, infecting the whole operation of our government.\nWhen the outcome is fixed, when the system is rigged, people lose hope – they stop dreaming, they stop trying.\nWhen the powerful can get away with anything, because they have the money and the connections to rig the system, then people lose confidence in our laws and in our future.\nHillary's corruption is corrosive to the soul of our nation, and it must be stopped.\nAs FDR once said, \"government by organized money is just as dangerous as government by organized mob.\"\nHillary believes money and power – not truth and justice – should rule the day.\nWe have one ultimate check on Hillary's corruption, and that is the power of voting. The only way to beat the corruption is to show up and vote by the tens of millions, including millions of people voting for the first time in their entire lives.\nVote with all of your heart and soul to Make America Great Again.\nRestoring honesty to our government, and the rule of law to our society, will be my highest priority as President.\nHaven't we had enough drama with the Clintons? Bill Clinton was impeached for lying and obstructing justice, signed the worst trade deal in history, NAFTA, which emptied our country of it's manufacturing jobs, and he doesn't even have the right to practice law.\nHillary has brought scandal or destroyed everything she touched.\nLook at Whitewater, cattle futures, jobs in Upstate New York, or look at Syria, Iraq, Libya, and now her emails.\nThis will be the year the American people say: enough is enough.\nThis will be the year the American people break with the bitter failures of the past and embrace a new and optimistic future.\nMy Contract With The American Voter begins with a plan to end government corruption.\nI want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words we are all about to say.\nWhen we win on November 8th, We Are Going To Washington, D.C. And We Are Going To DRAIN THE SWAMP.\nAt the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs.\nRight now, 70 million American women and children live in poverty, or near the brink of poverty.\nAmerica has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill and Hillary's NAFTA. America has lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization.\nWe are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. Hillary's goal is to send millions and millions more jobs out of our country.\nHillary is going to raise taxes up to 45 percent, massively expand regulation, shut down American energy, and push through terrible trade deals that offshore our jobs for the benefit of her donors.\nHer policies will cause a major recession, or even a depression.\nA Trump Administration will stop TPP, renegotiate NAFTA, and we are going to stand up to China on Currency Manipulation.\nWe are going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent.\nWe are going to cut taxes for Middle Class families by hundreds of billions of dollars.\nMy infrastructure plan will provide help for projects like the proposed Interstate-11, which would connect Phoenix with Las Vegas and other areas.\nWe will also unleash the full power of American energy including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal.\nWe will become a rich nation once again.\nBut to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.\nA Trump Administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. And yes, we will build a wall.\nWe have the endorsement of America's ICE and Border Patrol Officers, the first time they have ever made an endorsement.\nWhen Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State she allowed thousands of the most dangerous criminal aliens in the world to go free inside America because their home countries wouldn't take them back.\nThese were people guilty of murder, assault, rape, and all manner of violent crime.\nHillary has pledged \"open borders,\" and supports Sanctuary Cities.\nCountless Americans are killed by illegal immigrants because our government won't do it's job.\nThese include amazing Americans like Sergeant Brandon Mendoza, of Mesa Arizona, who was killed by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record who should have been deported – but the government refused to act. I've spent time with his incredible mother.\n28-year-old Park Ranger Kris Eggle was shot and killed by a drug cartel hit squad responsible for a number of murders. Kris died trying to protect our borders from drug and weapon trafficking into the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument.\n33-year-old Phoenix Police Officer Nick Erfle, a young cancer survivor, was murdered by a previously- deported illegal immigrant with a felony warrant. Nick was shot twice in the back of the head.\n21-year-old Grant Ronnebeck, was working at a convenience store in Mesa Arizona when he was shot point blank by an illegal immigrant.\nHis illegal immigrant killer, despite a criminal record, was out on bond, roaming free.\nWhen I become President, this crime wave ends.\nWe are going to cancel all federal funding for Sanctuary Cities.\nWe are going to impose tough prison sentences for illegal immigrants who return after a previous deportation.\nWe will end illegal immigration, deport every last criminal alien, and save American lives.\nWe will also repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military. We have the endorsements of over 200 Admirals and Generals and 22 Medal of Honor Recipients.\nOur Air Force is the smallest and oldest it has ever been, and my plan builds the modern, advanced fighter aircraft we need – fighters like those that will be stationed at Luke Air Force Base.\nOur Army is the smallest it has been since before World War II, and we will significantly increase both the size of our Army and the emphasis we place on intelligence – that means supporting the men and women at Fort Huachuca, home of the Army's Intelligence Center.\nPlaces like Marine Corps Air Station Yuma will have new aircraft – they won't have to get spare parts from museums anymore.\nWe also need a new foreign policy that puts America First.\nHillary's policies unleashed ISIS, empowered Iran, and spread death and destruction across the Middle East.\nHillary and our failed Washington Establishment have spent $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East, and now it's in worse shape than ever before.\nOur failed establishment has betrayed the American worker and family. They've dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe, they have left our borders wide open at home, and they've shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries.\nTo all Americans I say: it is time for new leadership.\nJust think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days –\nWe are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; cancel every illegal Obama executive order; stop the massive inflow of refugees and keep Radical Islamic Terrorist out of our country; rebuild our military and take care of our Vets; reduce surging crime and support the men and women of law enforcement; provide school choice and put an end to Common Core; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\nAmericans are tired of being told by politicians that they have to defer their dreams to another day, but they really mean another decade.\nHillary has been there for 30 years, and she has accomplished nothing – she's just made things worse.\nShe is the candidate of yesterday. We are the movement of the future.\nOur movement represents all Americans, from all backgrounds, and all walks of life. We are asking for the votes of Republicans, Democrats, Independents, and first-time voters.\nWe are fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people – not the donors and special interests.\nWe are fighting to unlock the potential of every American community, and every American family, who yearns for a better future.\nWith your vote, we are just 10 days away from the change you've been waiting for your entire life.\nTogether, We Will Make America JUST Again.\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.", "timestamp": "2016-10-29", "title": "Remarks at the Phoenix Convention Center in Phoenix, Arizona"}
{"author": "Joe Biden", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119639", "text": "Hi everybody, Joe Biden here.\nI delivered a report to President Obama laying out how far we've come since he put me in charge of the Cancer Moonshot back in January—and a real vision of where we need to go in the immediate future to: do in five years what would otherwise take ten; inject a sense of urgency into the fight against cancer; and change the culture and reimagine our system to win.\nWhen President Nixon declared war on cancer in 1971, he had no army, no resources, and no clear strategy to win. But after 45 years of progress, funding research, training scientists and physicians, and treating millions of patients—we now have the army. We now have powerful new tools. And with this Moonshot, we now have a clear strategy for the road ahead. It matters because there's a consensus that we're at an inflection point—with science, medicine, and technology advancing faster than ever and offering real promise. But we can't play by the rules of 1971—in 2016.\nJust five years ago, immunotherapy—using the immune system to kill cancer cells while protecting healthy ones—wasn't taken seriously. Now it is and it's offering real hope. Decades of research has accumulated huge amounts of data—but it's not shared, it's hard to understand, and often not accessible to researchers and the public. But now we're in the position to break down silos to change that.\nAnd the Moonshot vision report reflects what Jill and I have learned after meeting with thousands of cancer patients and their families, advocates, physicians, researchers, philanthropists, technology leaders, and heads of states about what's happening now and what we need to do. It's everything from enhancing prevention efforts, expanding access to care, and forging an international commitment to this fight.\nThis week I also released a report from the Cancer Moonshot Task Force— the team I'm leading to reimagine the federal government's fight against this dreaded disease. It touches almost every corner of government. For example, you'd expect the National Institutes of Health to be involved in researching radiation therapy for cancer patients. But would you expect NASA to be involved? Nobody in the world knows more about radiation and its effects on the human body than NASA, whose scientists are constantly finding ways to protect our astronauts from harmful radiation in space. Now, thanks to the Moonshot, the National Institute of Cancer will use that knowledge to help cancer patients.\nHere's another great example. Right now, only 4% of adult cancer patients are enrolled in clinical trials. Why? Most patients—and even doctors—don't know where to go. And it's a problem for drug companies because they don't have enough patients to generate the research, find new breakthroughs, and get them to patients. But now thanks to the work of the Presidential Innovation Fellows—some of the top technology minds who left Silicon Valley to work in the White House—anyone can go to Trials.Cancer.Gov, type in real words like \"breast cancer,\" a zip code, or an age, and more easily find a list of clinical trials nearby.\nAnd another thing that's happening that didn't before is the private sector is also reimagining what it can and should do. In just the last few months, more than 70 new public and private sector commitments have been made from companies like Microsoft and Amazon. IBM, for example, came to us and offered Watson, its supercomputer, to partner with the Department of Defense, and the VA.

This was Secretary Clinton's first campaign speech after FBI director James Comey reopened the investigation into Clinton's private email server.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119691", "text": "Go, Daytona Beach! Wow. Thank you. Thank you so much. [Chants of \"Hillary.\"] Thank you, all. Wow. Thank you. Thank you. I am just thrilled to be here. Are you I'm ready to canvass? Well, we need your help in these last 10 days until the election.\nI want to thank Leslie Pearce for that introduction and her lifelong work on behalf of children. I want to thank State Representative Dwayne Taylor and Mayor Derrick Henry for being here with us. And to all of the elected officials, all of the organizers and the volunteers, I am thrilled to have this chance to come by and talk with you for a few minutes about what's at stake in this election because this may be one of the most important elections in our lifetimes. And we cannot take anything or anyone for granted.\nI was just over at BCU for their homecoming celebration. And a lot of people told me they had already voted, but I said, 'Get your friends. Get your family. Get everybody you know to vote' because you've got early voting here in this county, in Volusia County, until November 5th. No excuses. Everybody's got to get out and vote. And that's what this canvass is meant to make sure we do. Right?\nNow, I'm sure that some of you may have heard about a letter that the FBI director sent out yesterday. Well, if you're like me, you probably have a few questions about it. It is pretty strange. It's pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information right before an election. In fact, in fact, it's not just strange. It's unprecedented. And it is deeply troubling because voters deserve get to full and complete facts. And so we've called on Director Comey to explain everything right away, put it all out on the table. Right?\nNow, of course, Donald Trump is already making up lies about this. He is doing his best to confuse, mislead, and discourage the American people. I think it's time for Donald Trump to stop fear mongering, to stop disgracing himself, to stop attacking our democracy. We can't let him get away with this, can we?\nNow, like any campaign, there have been ups and downs and ups and downs, but I've got to tell you I feel so motivated, so excited, so ready because I've always stayed focused on one thing: you and your families. What I worry about are the problems that keep you up at night, and I'm going to stay focused on that, because you know on November 9th that's what's going to matter. We can't let this election in the last 10 days be about the noise and the distractions. It's got to be about what kind of country we want for ourselves, our children, and our grandchildren – and who can help take us there as your president.\n[Chants of \"Hillary!\"]\nNow, I think you and I agree the choice is pretty clear between a president who's ready to bring us together, keep us safe, and make the economy work for everyone, not just those at the top, and someone who is temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified for the job.\nNow, I promise you this: I will never stop working for you every single day as a candidate and most importantly as your president. That's how I was raised. When I was over at B-CU I met one of the Methodist ministers because B-CU is affiliated with the Methodist Church, and I felt right at home. And my mother – my mother taught me to never, ever quit. Now what does that mean? Well, that means everybody gets knocked down. What matters is whether you get back up. And I've been fighting for families and underdogs my entire life, and I'm not stopping now. We're just getting started.\nAnd let's always remember what our wonderful First Lady told us: 'When they go low, we go high.' So no matter what they throw at us in these last days, we're not going to back down. We're not going to get distracted. We're not going to get knocked off course. Because we know how much the election matters. We know how many people are counting on us. And that's why we're going to reject Donald Trump's dark and divisive vision about America.\nWe are going to stick together and we are going to win on November the 8th. Right? Because Donald Trump's strategy is pretty simple. They've even said it in his campaign. It's to get women to stay home, get young people to stay home, get people of color to stay home, and get a lot – get a lot of smart, intelligent men to stay home too. Now, this is all part of his scorched earth campaign. It goes against everything we stand for. And you know how we stop him? By showing up with the biggest turnout of voters in American history.\nWe need more of everybody to vote – more women, more young people, more people of color, more African Americans, more Latinos, everybody. Let's break every record that we've ever had for voting. Let's make that the story of this election. And here in Florida you can, as you often have, make the difference. Right, Florida? If you all vote and you get everybody you know to vote, if you go out and talk to people today and every day about what's at stake in this election, then we will make history. We will win up and down the ballot. And I feel strongly about this, because we need people in Washington who are problem-solvers, not problem-makers. That's why I hope you'll vote to send Patrick Murphy to the Senate. He will be an independent voice for Florida families. And this is important: Unlike his opponent, Patrick has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.\nNow, here's some really good news. We just reached a milestone. More than 200 million Americans are registered to vote. That is the highest number ever. And that includes 50 million young people. That's the most in history. And you know what else? More than 16.5 million people have already voted in this election. And more than 3 million of those votes have been right here in Florida. Now, you only see numbers like we're seeing here in Florida when people are standing up for what they really believe in. Americans are coming together, and I know because I hear from people who are Republicans and Independents who are joining us to reject hate and division, rejecting Donald Trump's demeaning treatment of women, his plans to break up immigrant families and deport millions of people, his lie that President Obama wasn't born in America.\nI'll tell you, we have learned who Donald Trump is. Now it's up to us to show who we are. And the energy that we are seeing is not just about what we're against, it's about what we're for. It's about a common vision that we share for a hopeful, dynamic, unified America where everyone counts, everyone has a place, everyone willing to work can get ahead and stay ahead, where women are respected – where veterans are honored, where workers are paid fairly, where marriage is a right and discrimination is wrong.\nSo my friends, it is not just the fact that my name will be on the ballot. Everything we care about is at stake – your future – making college affordable, helping you pay back your debt – the cost of prescription drugs down – protecting and defending Social Security and Medicare from privatization and Wall Street schemes. Fighting climate change is at stake. LGBT equality is at stake. Equal pay for women is at stake. In the end, we know that American dream itself is at stake.\nNow, did any of you see the debates?\"\nAudience: \"Yes.\"\nClinton: \"Well, I'll tell you, I stood next to Donald Trump for three debates, four and a half hours, proving conclusively I have the stamina to be president and commander-in-chief. But I have to tell you, he said a lot of things that were troubling. But in that last debate, he said something that was truly horrifying. He is the first person of a major party, Republican or Democrat, ever to refuse to say he would respect the outcome of the election. Now, we can think about every issue we care about, but you know, after attacking women and African Americans and Latinos and people with disabilities and Muslims and POWs and everybody, now he's attacking the institutions of democracy. And so it comes down to this. When your kids and grandkids ask, 'What did you do in the 2016 election when everything was on the line,' I want you to be able to say you voted for a better, fairer, stronger America.\nAnd the way we're going to do that: We're going to turn everybody out. Early voting has begun right here in Volusia County. Every day from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. until November 5th you can vote. The nearest early voting site is just one mile away from here at the Volusia County Library Center in City Island. So don't wait one more day. Go vote, and then help us get everybody else out to vote too.\nNow, I know – I know that we've got our canvass organizers up here. I don't want to take too much of their time because they are workers, they are organized, they are focused. I'm so grateful to them and to you, and we need you. We need you. Stakes couldn't be higher. We got to do everything we can. I don't want anybody waking up on November 9th and saying, 'Oh, I wish I had just done a little more.' So help us knock on doors, make phone calls, talk to voters, and ask them, 'When are you going to vote? Do you know where you're going to cast your ballot? Who will you take with you?' And make sure they know about early voting, already begun here in Florida. And then if you need to, sign up yourselves. We have signups for three more shifts between now and Election Day. And this is going to be a close election; they always are these days. And we're going to win because of you, because of hardworking volunteers like you. And if you know anybody thinking about voting for Donald Trump, stage an intervention. Remember, friends don't let friends vote for Trump.\nAnd think about it this way. On January 20th, we're going to have a new president. And I'll tell you what, I will be proud to build on the progress we've made under President Obama and go even further. But I can't do any of the things that I'm talking about, any of the plans that I have, unless you help me. So that's what I'm asking you. That's why I came to Daytona Beach today. I came to ask you to help me in these last ten days. Let's give every American a chance to chart their own future, make their own contributions. Let's build a future we can all be proud of, and let's make sure we prove once and for all that love trumps hate.\nThank you.", "timestamp": "2016-10-29", "title": "Remarks at the Dickerson Community Center in Daytona Beach, Florida"}

Before I begin, your Chief of the Boat asked me to say one word, and he promised that you would know how to respond. So let me give this a try: \"Fighting!\"\nCREW OF THE USS ILLINOIS: Illini!\nMRS. OBAMA: It continues to be very cool. (Laughter.)\nLet me just start by thanking Governor Malloy, Undersecretary Davidson, Admiral Richardson, the officers of the ILLINOIS, Commander Porter and Master Chief DiPietro, and all our other outstanding Navy leaders, as well as Senator Blumenthal, Representatives Langevin, Courtney, and Hultgren, and, of course, Jeff Geiger and Matt Mulherin.\nAnd of course, I want to take a moment to just give a huge shout-out to our military families –- our amazing military spouses and partners. And since we've asked people to raise their hands, I just want to find out how many military kids are here with us today. Let's give our kids a round of applause. (Applause.)\nAnd I understand this crew has been pretty busy. Since the crew was stood up, there have been 32 babies born -- (laughter) -- and three more on the way. So way to go. (Laughter.) Thank you for that. And one thing I just want to say to the military families -- while you might not wear a uniform, I know, we all know, the nation knows that you serve and sacrifice right alongside of your loved ones. And we are so grateful and proud of all of you for your service to this nation.\nNow, we're here today to commission the Navy's newest Virginia-class submarine: The USS ILLINOIS. And I have to say that this moment is a little bittersweet for me because today marks our last event together, at least while I'm First Lady -- the end of a journey that started more than two years ago. Back then, this boat was in four components spread over three states; today, it's the most advanced ship in the Navy -– a ship that's as complicated to operate as a space shuttle, a ship that can carry out any kind of critical mission, from search-and-rescue to scientific research.\nAnd all of this is a great credit to Jeff and Matt and all of the hardworking folks at General Dynamics Electric Boat and Huntington Ingalls Industries and Newport News Shipbuilding. Again, let's give them all a round of applause. Thank you so much for your hard work and dedication. (Applause.)\nBut Jeff and Matt will also be the first to tell you that it takes more than great materials to make a great ship. That's why today, in addition to commissioning this ship, we're also celebrating the outstanding sailors who serve on it. We already knew that you all had all the exceptional qualifications on paper, but then you went out in sea trials and showed that you're even better in practice. You didn't just deliver this boat on time, you also displayed the courage and knowledge to truly earn your Dolphins. And today, every single one of you can do everything on this ship. You can fight a fire, you can stop a flood. You all earned a perfect score on your weapons test, and you passed your engineering certification on the very first try. That's my crew. Proud of you all. (Applause.)\nFrom your head cook, Petty Officer First Class Joe White, who I hear runs the best Mess in the business -- let's take a moment to honor the food -- (applause) -- to Petty Officer First Class Ryan Mock, whose team of engineers oversees a nuclear reactor filled with over 450-degree water, which sounds like something out of \"Star Trek\" -- this whole ship is just amazingly complicated to me. It's just incredible what this crew can do.\nSo you all are the very definition of excellence. And speaking of excellence, I actually have the pleasure of making a special announcement today. In recognition of his outstanding service, Ryan Mock's officers have selected him as this ship's Sailor of the Year. So congratulations to Ryan and to his family. We're proud of you. (Applause.)\nAnd that's really why Jill Biden and I started Joining Forces –- because we are proud of all of you. I can't say it enough. Working with our military community has been the biggest honor of my life. This is a proud moment for me. We wanted to rally all of Americans to serve you as well as you serve this country every single day. And I am thrilled by everything that we've achieved together over the past five years to ensure that you and your families have the jobs you deserve, the benefits you've earned, and the honor and support of our nation, that you know that we love you.\nSo today, I want to end by once again telling you that I am beyond proud. Your Commander-in-Chief is also proud. Thank you for giving me the incredible privilege of being associated with you and your families and with the ILLINOIS for the rest of my life. I will continue to keep you in my prayers every single day, and keep you in my thoughts. And know that you have a sponsor that cares deeply. And from this voyage until her last, may God bless and keep this ship and all who serve on her.\nAnd with that, it is my honor to give your very first order. Are we ready?\nOfficers and crew of the USS ILLINOIS, \"Man our ship and bring her to life!\" (Applause.)", "timestamp": "2016-10-29", "title": "Remarks by the First Lady at the Commissioning of the U.S.S.

{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119424", "text": "Sunday, as reported by the Associated Press, a group of nearly 100 former federal prosecutors and high-ranking DOJ officials from both Democratic and Republican administrations, including former AG Eric Holder and former Deputy AG Larry Thompson, issued the following joint letter expressing serious concerns over FBI Director Comey's departure from long-standing department protocols:\nAs former federal prosecutors and high-ranking officials of the U.S. Department of Justice, we know that the impartiality and nonpartisanship of the United States justice system makes it exceptional throughout the world. To maintain fairness and neutrality, federal law enforcement officials must exercise discipline whenever they make public statements in connection with an ongoing investigation. Often, evidence uncovered during the course of an investigative inquiry is incomplete, misleading or even incorrect, and releasing such information before all of the facts are known and tested in a court of law can unfairly prejudice individuals and undermine the public's faith in the integrity of our legal process.\nFor this reason, Justice Department officials are instructed to refrain from commenting publicly on the existence, let alone the substance, of pending investigative matters, except in exceptional circumstances and with explicit approval from the Department of Justice officials responsible for ultimate supervision of the matter. They are also instructed to exercise heightened restraint near the time of a primary or general election because, as official guidance from the Department instructs, public comment on a pending investigative matter may affect the electoral process and create the appearance of political interference in the fair administration of justice.\nIt is out of our respect for such settled tenets of the United States Department of Justice that we are moved to express our concern with the recent letter issued by FBI Director James Comey to eight Congressional Committees. Many of us have worked with Director Comey; all of us respect him. But his unprecedented decision to publicly comment on evidence in what may be an ongoing inquiry just eleven days before a presidential election leaves us both astonished and perplexed. We cannot recall a prior instance where a senior Justice Department official—Republican or Democrat—has, on the eve of a major election, issued a public statement where the mere disclosure of information may impact the election's outcome, yet the official acknowledges the information to be examined may not be significant or new.\nDirector Comey's letter is inconsistent with prevailing Department policy, and it breaks with longstanding practices followed by officials of both parties during past elections. Moreover, setting aside whether Director Comey's original statements in July were warranted, by failing to responsibly supplement the public record with any substantive, explanatory information, his letter begs the question that further commentary was necessary. For example, the letter provides no details regarding the content, source or recipient of the material; whether the newly-discovered evidence contains any classified or confidential information; whether the information duplicates material previously reviewed by the FBI; or even \"whether or not [the] material may be significant.\"\nPerhaps most troubling to us is the precedent set by this departure from the Department's widely-respected, non-partisan traditions. The admonitions that warn officials against making public statements during election periods have helped to maintain the independence and integrity of both the Department's important work and public confidence in the hardworking men and women who conduct themselves in a nonpartisan manner.\nWe believe that adherence to longstanding Justice Department guidelines is the best practice when considering public statements on investigative matters. We do not question Director Comey's motives. However, the fact remains that the Director's disclosure has invited considerable, uninformed public speculation about the significance of newly-discovered material just days before a national election. For this reason, we believe the American people deserve all the facts, and fairness dictates releasing information that provides a full and complete picture regarding the material at issue.\nSignatories:\n*\nEric H.

There's a lot of noise and distraction, but it really comes down to what kind of future we want and who, as our president, can help us get there. So I want you to know – now, I just have to say I know I'm preaching to the choir. But I also, through you, want to talk to people who are still making up their minds, believe it or not, right? Because we've got a choice between a president who will bring us together, keep our country safe, get the economy working for everyone, not just those at the top – or someone who's temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified for the job. You know, Donald Trump is doing his best to confuse, mislead, and discourage the American people. I mean, he's such a downer, right? And it's time for him to stop fear mongering, stop distracting from what's really at stake, and frankly, stop disgracing our democracy. We can't let him get away with this.\nBut here's the good news. Yes, America is great, and we can make it greater if we work together and we set some goals. But we are seeing Americans coming together – Democrats, Republicans, independents – to reject Donald Trump's dark and divisive vision of our country. And it's going to be really important that we make it clear to everyone in these last nine days what's at stake. Because I really believe the vast majority of Americans agree with us. We don't want a president who demeans women. We don't want a president who has plans to break up and deport immigrant families. We don't want a president who perpetrated the lie that President Obama wasn't born in America. We don't want a president who would appoint Supreme Court justices to overturn marriage equality. But I want you to know, the energy we're now seeing out in the campaign is not just about what we're against, it's also about what we're for. Because we also share a common vision. Beyond partisanship and politics, it's a hopeful, inclusive America where everyone counts and everyone has a place, right?\nAnd that's exactly what I'm going to be fighting for in these last nine days. We're going to honor people, not insult them. Donald Trump has insulted more than half of our population. African Americans, Latinos, immigrants, Muslims, POWs, women. And by what he has said, so many others who believe that you have a positive future. I agree with that: you do. And I promise you this: I'm going to keep working every single day for you and for the vision of America that we share.\nNow, I will tell you, my mom taught me to never, ever quit, and what does that mean? Well, that means –\"\nAudience Member: \"Rise up.\"\nClinton: \"You got it. You got it. And it also means when you're knocked down, what matters is whether you get up again. I have been fighting for families and underdogs my entire life. I'm not stopping now. We're just getting warmed up, right? And we won't be distracted, no matter what our opponents throw at us. We're not going to be knocked off course. We know how much this election matters, and we know how many people are counting on us. So we're going to take to heart the words of our wonderful First Lady, Michelle Obama: When they go low, we go high.\nWe're going to keep our foot on the gas because Donald Trump's strategy is real simple. They've even said it in his campaign. Here's his strategy about how he's going to win: Get women to stay home. Get young people to stay home. Get people of color to stay home. Get the LGBT committee to say home. It's all part of his scorched earth campaign, and it goes against everything we stand for. So you know how we're going to stop him? By showing up with the biggest turnout in American history.\nWe need everybody to turn out and vote – women, young people, people of color, the LGBT community, Latinos, African Americans, Americans from all walks of life. Let's break every single record. Let's make that the story of this election. And here's some really good news. This is amazing. More than 20 million people have already voted in this election, most of those votes in the last few days, 3 million of those votes from right here in Florida. Now, you only see numbers like that when people are standing up for what they really believe in. So if all of you vote, if your friends, your family, your coworkers vote, if everyone you talk to between now and Election Day votes, we are going to make some really big history on November the 8th.\nAnd I want you not only coming out for me. I want you to reelect our members of Congress. And please elect Patrick Murphy to the Senate. And if there are still people who have doubts about the stakes in the election, listen to this. We've heard some outrageous things in this campaign. I'm sure we'll hear more in the next nine days. But I got to tell you, I was beginning to think that nothing we learned about Donald Trump could surprise me anymore.\nBut yesterday the Washington Post published a report that was truly stunning. It starts with the story of a ribbon-cutting back in 1996 for a nursery school serving children living with HIV and AIDS in New York. Now, let me say, this is important in part to remember. This is a story about children with HIV and AIDS. So there was a big celebration honoring the donors who had supported the nursery school, and all the kids and their families, for whom this was the most important thing you can imagine. Because you know, back in the '90s, some of you remember. Right? Children weren't welcomed in school.\nAnd then, unannounced and uninvited, guess who barges in? Donald Trump. He walks right up to the stage. He sat down in the seat that was being saved for a local developer who had made a generous donation. None of the people working for the charity knew why he was there. He wasn't a donor at all. He had never given a single dollar to help build the school. He just wanted people to think he had. So he sat on the stage through the program, even posed for photographs, and when it was over, he got up and walked out. No explanation. No donation. Now really, who does that? What kind of person does that? Really? I mean, who pretends to help kids with HIV and AIDS in order to make themselves look good? Well, I'll tell you: The same kind of person who would pull a bait and switch on a high school chess team.\nBack in 1997, he was principal for a day at a public school. That was a program we used to have in New York. The chess team was holding a bake sale to raise money to travel to a tournament. They were $5,000 short. He walked up to them and handed them a fake million dollar bill. At first the kids and their parents were excited. Then they were devastated to learn it was a joke. So he gave them 200 bucks and drove away in his limousine. Now, this story does have a happy ending because a woman read the story about Donald Trump's behavior, called the school, and donated the $5,000. And the coach remembers this woman saying, \"I am ashamed to be the same species as this man.\"\nNow, I got to say, any of you see the debates? Well, you know, I stood next to Donald Trump in three debates for four and a half hours, proving conclusively I have the stamina to do this job. Right? But a lot of what we've heard him say is part of a lifelong pattern. And here's what the Washington Post concludes. 'For as long as he has been rich and famous, he has wanted people to believe he is generous. He spent years constructing an image as a philanthropist by appearing at charity events and by making very public, even nationally televised promises, to give his own money away. It was in large part a faзade.' And a months-long investigation by the Washington Post found that Trump had sought credit for charity he had not given or had claimed other people's giving as his own.\nNow, of course, because he's refused to release his tax returns, we don't even know if he's ever given anything. But here's what we do know. With Donald, it's always Donald Trump first and everyone else last. He abuses his power. He games the system, and he doesn't care who's left holding the bag.\nAnd here's what else we know. Donald Trump has a terrible record on LGBT rights. And this election will determine whether we continue the progress we've made or let it be ripped away. We know Trump has promised he'll appoint Supreme Court justices who will overturn marriage equality and that he will repeal President Obama's executive actions to protect LGBT people from discrimination. And just this week, a new story came out that tells us a lot about how he treats LGBT employees. It's a story of a maintenance worker at one of Trump's golf courses. So I want you just to think.\nThis guy works hard. Works with his hands. Probably there 12 hours a day, maybe more, when it's the summer season. After he told his coworkers he was gay, they started harassing him. They called him names. They even threw rocks and golf balls at him. It got so bad he ended up in the hospital. Now, his supervisor saw all of this and did nothing. So finally he went to the police for help. He was too scared even to come back to work. And what did the Trump golf course do? They fired him.\nNow, this is a heart-wrenching story on a lot of levels. For starters, it's a painful reminder of the harassment, violence, and discrimination too many LGBT Americans still face every single day. And it's deeply distributing that instead of stepping in to stop this unacceptable behavior, Trump's business punished the victim for coming forward. Now, if that's how Donald Trump runs his business, what does it say about how he would run our country? We've made a lot of progress on LGBT rights, but as that story reminds us, we still have work ahead, don't we?\nThere is still no federal law that stops an employer from refusing to hire someone just because he or she is LGBT, or a landlord from refusing to rent an apartment to a transgender tenant, and of course there are still states where you could get married on Saturday, post your Facebook photos on Sunday, and get fired on Monday just because of who you are and who you love. So here's what I'll do as president. We will call on the Congress to pass the Equality Act. And we will then be able to protect LGBT Americans from discrimination in all aspects of our lives. We'll work together to achieve the AIDS-free generation that is within our reach. And we will take on homelessness, bullying, and violence, particularly youth homelessness, which disproportionately hurts LGBT kids. And we are going to end the harmful practice of so-called conversion therapy. LGBT kids don't need to be cured of anything. They just need to be accepted and embraced and respected. And yes, we're going to bring people together to reform our gun laws and keep guns from falling into the wrong hands so that what happened in Orlando can never happen again.\nNow, some of you know, Chad Griffin and others know, this issue is really important to me. I traveled to 112 countries as your Secretary of State. I saw how countries around the world treated lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people. And I believe with all my heart America has to lead by example. I want – I want LGBT people in every corner of our country – because don't forget you all living in Wilton Manors have moved far away from a lot of the places where people are still scared today. Right? And we're going to elevate this issue. We're going to talk about it. We're going to reach out.\nSo when you vote in this election, remember, it's not just my name on the ballot. It's your future. It's who we are as a country. It's every issue we care about. And make no mistake: LGBT rights are at stake. Dignity and respect for every American is at stake. The future of our economy is at stake.\nI believe when the middle class thrives, Americans thrive. And we're going to make America the clean-energy superpower of the 21st Century, too. And if we're serious about supporting a middle class, we're going to be supporting families.\nThe other day, I was in Pittsburgh. And there was a woman there with her young child. We've got some folks from Pittsburgh. She was shaking Tim Kaine's hand. And she said to him, \"I came here hoping I could tell you or Secretary Clinton I had my baby three years ago. And the next day, I was fired. It had been a difficult pregnancy. I called to ask if I could take a little time to recover, and the answer was 'No. Don't come back at all.' Nobody, no parent, should ever have to make that kind of choice, but that's also true when we talk about paid family leave, caring for a spouse or a partner, caring for an elderly relative.\nI want us to recognize the way we live today. It is no longer the 1950s. We need to support people who are part of committed relationships, of families, of marriages, and give everybody the support you need to actually do what's the most important thing in life. And that is caring for each other. We're going to do everything we can to catch up to the rest of the world: affordable childcare, paid family leave, earned sick days, jobs with rising incomes. We're going to raise the national minimum wage. No one who works full-time should have to raise a family in poverty.\nAnd yes, we're going to guarantee equal pay for women's work. We're going to make sure. We're going to make sure that we not only grow the economy but we make it fairer. And I've got to tell you that's such a stark contrast with Trump. He believes if you give the biggest tax cut in American history to the wealthy – that's with trillions of dollars going to the top – that will somehow trickle down. It hasn't worked. It won't work. I believe that we could grow the economy from the middle out and the bottom up. And that's exactly what we're going to do.\nSo, my friends, we've got a guy who won't pay his income tax. I mean, I've got to just say when we learned in the debate that he lost a billion dollars and that meant that he didn't pay income tax for like 20 years, he said that was smart. And I thought to myself, how smart do you have to be to lose a billion dollars? I mean, really. And what kind of genius are you to lose a billion dollars while running casinos? But it's serious because it means he's paid zero, zero for our military, our vets, for healthcare, for Pell Grants, for our universities, our colleges, our highways. This is Trump to a T.\nThe stories that I told you about him showing up and acting like he's done something, well, he shows up and criticizes our country. He shows up and discriminates against African Americans when he was denying them the right to rent apartments. He chose to make his products in other countries, not America. He's built a career on stiffing small businesses. I take that personally. My dad was a small business owner. I'm sure glad he never got a contract from Donald Trump.\nSo, my friends, we've got work to do. And let's get to that work. We've got to make sure that we get everybody out to vote. I want you to be able to say on November 9th you voted for a better future, you voted for a better America. And look how easy it is. It is so easy. Wilton Manors City Hall is just a half a mile down the street from where we are right now. And if you are registered in Broward County, you can go to any early-vote location in the county from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. all week. And if you have been mailed your ballot, make sure you fill it out and mail it back today. You can go to iwillvote.com to confirm your polling place. And make sure you have a plan to vote.\nBut, please, also help us in these last nine days. Every phone call you make, every door you knock on will make a difference. So go to hillaryclinton.com. Sign up to volunteer. Take out your phone. Text 'JOIN,' J-O-I-N, to 47246. I don't want anybody waking up on Wednesday morning and seeing the results and getting depressed. I'm against depression. We don't want that to happen in this election. Right?\"\nAudience: \"No!\"\nClinton: \"I don't want people to be sad because they didn't do their part. We can't let that happen. And I have to ask you if you – if you know anybody, if you know anybody, who is thinking about voting for Trump, you've got to stage an intervention. Do everything you can to try to convince that person that they surely care about something that Donald Trump is on the wrong side of because I can guarantee you they do because, after all, friends don't let friends vote for Trump. Right?\nSo I am so grateful to all of you. Have many of you have already voted? Okay. So, now, how many of you will help us get somebody else to vote? That's what's going to make the difference. Change is coming. Let's make sure it's the right kind of change. The choice is yours. We're going to do everything we can to build a stronger, better, fairer America, coming together, healing the divides among us. And we're going to prove, once and for all, that love trumps Hate. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2016-10-30", "title": "Remarks at the Manor Complex in Wilton Manors, Florida"}

We call on him, now that he has injected himself into the electoral process, to immediately provide as much detail as possible so the American public can deal with facts rather than rank speculation and innuendo. But we should not be in this position in the first place.\nIt is long-standing Justice Department policy that employees \"must be particularly sensitive to safeguarding the Department's reputation for fairness,neutrality, and nonpartisanship.\" As prosecutors, we were faced with allegations against candidates during every election. It is important not to comment on pending investigations close to an election or else risk that the normal criminal investigation process will be manipulated for political gain. Prosecutors and investigators must use great caution in even acknowledging investigations prior to their conclusion. The damage to a citizen's reputation often cannot be repaired, even if that person is totally cleared by the investigation or the allegations are proven to be completely groundless.\nIt appears that Director Comey has made a serious mistake in allowing this unfair speculation and innuendo to exist.

{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "note": "Speech as delivered. Secretary Clinton was introduced by both Mark and Gabby Kelly, the former a retired astronaut, engineer, and US Navy Captain.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119502", "text": "Secretary Clinton: \"Thank you so much! Wow, it is great to be back in Cincinnati. What a beautiful night on the banks of this magnificent river. I am grateful to all of you. I am thrilled to be here with my dear friends Mark and Gabby, and with all of you, because there are just eight days left in what is the most important election of our lifetimes.\nAre you ready to work hard in this election and win it? Are you ready to send Ted Strickland to the United States Senate? I've known Ted a long time. He is a champion for workers and families. He knows that Ohio needs more good jobs with rising wages. And he is the kind of person who will actually work to get things done, breaking through the gridlock in Washington. And this is important: unlike his opponent, Ted Strickland has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.\nI also want to thank Mayor John Cranley and State Representative Alicia Reece and all the other elected officials, including my friend, the Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, from across the river in Kentucky. And we are so fortunate to have two other champions for American families with us today. I am awed by the courage and commitment that both Mark and Gabby bring to their work, to do everything they can to help save lives in America.\nYou know, as Gabby says every day when she goes out, fight, fight, fight. And fight she does. She fights to make sure that we save lives and we prevent injuries and we do it together – to end the epidemic of gun violence that threatens our children, our fellow men and women, our country. And Gabby and Mark know something very important: there is a big majority of Americans, including a majority of gun owners, to stand behind and achieve commonsense gun safety measures. And I am looking forward to working with them as their partner.\nYou know, you go through life, you go through the campaigns, there are ups and there are downs. And my mother, who had a really difficult life, she told me something that has stayed with me and certainly has come in handy in this campaign. Everybody gets knocked down; what matters is whether you get back up. And throughout this campaign, I have stayed focused on one thing: you – your lives, your families, the problems that keep you up at night. Because that's really what this election is all about. It's not about the noise and the distractions. It's about what kind of country we want for our kids, and what kind of president can help get us there.\nI have so much that I want to do with you on behalf of Cincinnati and Ohio and America. And whether or not I get the chance to serve you really depends upon what happens in this election.\nNow, earlier today, I was up at Kent State, a great university, and I told them about some of the reasons why I think it's really important to get everybody out to vote in this election. But I started by saying that there's this new email story about – why in the world the FBI would decide to jump into an election without evidence of any wrongdoing with just days to go. That's a really good question. But I want you to know – look, I've said repeatedly I made a mistake, I'm not making any excuses, but I will tell you this. If they want to look at some more emails of one of my staffers, by all means, go ahead, look at them. And I know they will reach the same conclusion they reached when they looked at my emails last year, right? It wasn't even a close call, and I think most people have moved on. They're looking and focused on, okay, who is going to be the next president and commander-in-chief?\nDid any of you see the debates? Any of you see the debates? Well, I am – I got a little bit of a chance. I did stand there for four and a half hours with Donald Trump, proving conclusively I have the stamina to do the job. But I did occasionally get a chance to ask people to take a look at my 30 years of public service, my plans for our country, what Tim Kaine and I have said we want to do, and then weigh that against my opponent, what he's done and said. I am running against someone who says he doesn't understand why we can't use nuclear weapons. He actually said, \"Then why are we making them?\" He wants more countries to have nuclear weapons. He's mentioned Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia. Now, if you are hoping that he might surround himself with good people who would stop his crazy ideas, remember this. When he was asked who he consults with on foreign policy, Donald Trump said he didn't need to consult because, and I quote, \"I have a very good brain.\" He said he knows more about ISIS than our generals do. [Booing.] No, Donald, you don't. And of course, the people that Donald Trump has around him include two men whose activities are also reportedly being investigated because of their ties to Russia, Vladimir Putin, and their allies.\nSo in these last days, let's not get distracted from the real choice in this election. Donald Trump has proven himself to be temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president and commander-in-chief.\nI have to tell you, it does not give me any pleasure saying that. It's not a small thing. I have watched and known a lot of the people who have run for president, both Republicans and Democrats. And look, I've had my disagreements with Republicans. I might have disagreed on policies or principles, but I never doubted their fitness to serve in this office. Donald Trump is different, and that's why there is so much at stake in this election. He has a dark and divisive vision for America that could tear our country apart. Abraham Lincoln understood a house divided against itself cannot stand, and that was over the greatest of challenges – the challenge posed by slavery – and we fought a civil war. But we also have to take stock of how divided we are today, the kinds of divisions that need to be healed to bring people together.\nI will tell you this. I want to bring not just Democrats, but Republicans and Independents, people who vote for me and people who vote against me, together. Because I have a very different vision of America. Instead of dark and divisive, it's hopeful and inclusive. It's big-hearted, not small-minded. It is about lifting people up, not putting them down. It's a vision that says, and I believe this with all my heart, we are stronger together. And America is great because America is good. Never forget that. Yes, we have our flaws; of course, we're only humans. But what we have done over the course of our history to keep widening the circle of opportunity and equality and freedom is unlike any other place in the history of the world. So we want an America where women are respected – where our veterans are honored – where parents and families are supported and workers are paid fairly. And we believe in an America where marriage is a right, and discrimination is wrong. An America that leads in the world and lives up to our values, where everyone counts, everyone has a place, and the American dream is big enough for everybody. So the choice could not be clearer and the stakes could not be higher.\nWhen I was at Kent State talking about the threats that Donald Trump poses to our national security, I was really struck. It was a very big crowd, and it was primarily students. And I thought to myself, well, I'm not going to give a rah-rah speech because I really want to talk about what this means to national security. And I was introduced by a gentleman named Bruce Blair, a former Air Force officer in charge of the nuclear codes and keys. A launch officer. And he came out for me, along with now more than 30 launch officers, and basically they said, we cannot support Donald Trump because he should never, ever be near the nuclear codes and keys.\nAnd even the prospect of an actual nuclear war doesn't seem to bother him. \"Good luck. Enjoy yourselves, folks,\" is what he had to say about a potential nuclear conflict in Asia. I wonder if he even knows that a single – a single – nuclear warhead can kill millions of people? That is why dozens of retired nuclear launch officers took the unprecedented step of saying that Donald should, and I quote, \"not have his finger on the button.\" And when it comes to handling a crisis, we've seen in this campaign that Donald Trump loses his cool at the slightest provocation – when he's gotten a tough question from a reporter, or when he's challenged in a debate, or when he sees a protestor at a rally, when he's confronted by his own words. So imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. [Cries of \"No!\"] Imagine him plunging us into a war because somebody got under his very thin skin. I hope you'll think about that when you cast your vote in this election. Think about what it takes to lead in a very complicated world, and in whose hands you want to put the safety of our children and grandchildren.\nAnd think about the difference between electing a president who will do nothing and president who will tackle the epidemic of gun violence in America. As Gabby knows so well, 33,000 Americans a year are killed guns. Thousands more are injured. It's an average of 90 people a day dying. Here in Ohio more people are killed by guns than die in car crashes. We have seen moviegoers gunned down in theaters, little children killed in their classrooms, clubgoers massacred in Orlando, nine faithful people murdered at Bible study in Charleston, South Carolina. And we've seen far too many young African American men and women killed by gun violence, which is now the leading cause of death for young black men. And when we think about that, we think of Dontre Hamilton or Jordan Davis or Trayvon Martin and others. I've had the great honor of getting to know their mothers, who have turned their grief into action and their mourning into a movement.\nBut here's what I want to say. If anything else in our country were killing as many people, people of good faith, people who believe, like we do, in the Second Amendment, people who own guns, people who go hunting, people who are collectors, we would say, hey, wait a minute. This can't go on. We need comprehensive background checks to close the gun show loophole, close the online loophole. And we know here in Ohio a majority of gun owners support these common-sense steps to prevent gun violence because they know we can respect the Second Amendment and keep our kids and communities safe at the same time. And we need to keep guns out of the hands suspected terrorists. If you are too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun, period.\nAnd look. There is a very clear difference. Donald Trump won't stand up to the gun lobby. He's sold out to them. In fact, the gun lobby is spending more on ads to get Donald Trump elected than any other group, more than $7 million in Ohio alone. And in return, Donald Trump has promised to repeat President Obama's actions to strengthen criminal background checks. Donald says guns should be allowed in nightclubs that serve alcohol. He's even said, on his very first day in office, he would require every school in America to let people carry guns into our classrooms. How can anyone think our schools would be safer with more guns?\nSo I have stood up to the gun lobby for years, which is why they are running all of these ads against me. And I will stand up to them as president. I will work with Gabby and Mark and Americans for Responsible Solutions to pass common sense reforms because we've got to keep guns out of the wrong hands and help save lives.\nI will also get up every day in the White House working my heart out for you, whatever I can do to knock down barriers to empower people, to get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top. That's how I was raised. I was raised to believe that if you work hard – and I believe in hard work – you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead in America. And I will never ever quit on you. When I tell you I'm going to try to do something that will make a positive difference in your life, I don't care what the political or other barriers are. We're going to find a way over, under, around, or through until we get it done. I've been fighting for families and underdogs my entire life, and I'm not stopping now. Remember, when our opponents go low, we go high. We're not going to be distracted. We're not going to be knocked off course. We know how much this election matters. And everything all of you can do between now and the time that the polls close is going to really count.\nNow, the Donald Trump campaign strategy is pretty simple. They've announced it. Their strategy is: get women to stay home, get young people to stay home, and get people of color to stay home. It's all part of his scorched-earth campaign, but it actually adds up to more than half of our whole population when you stop to think about it. And it goes against everything we stand for. So if you're as upset as I am by the campaign that he has run, the things he has said, insulting not just women but immigrants, Latinos, African Americans, prisoners of war, Muslims, veterans, the military – I mean, the list goes on and on. It's almost impossible to understand how somebody could run for president who seems not to like America as much as he does.\nSo you know the best way to stop him: by showing up with the biggest turnout in history. We need more Americans to vote. And I think we have a chance to get more Americans from all walks of life to vote because we're already seeing record turnout. Twenty-three million people have already voted in this election. And more than one million of them are right here in Ohio. There is no doubt if we vote, we win. So, please, if you haven't voted early, please do so. And please get your friends and your family, everybody you know to vote. Take people to vote with you. Try to help those who might have a little problem getting there.\nMake sure that everybody you know understands early voting has begun. And you can go to iwillvote.com to find your nearest early voting location because, make no mistake, whatever issue you care about – I've only mentioned a few tonight, but whatever issue you care about is on the ballot. Now, it may be my name and my opponent's name, but where we stand on these issues, what we've done in the past, what we have said we want to do in the future, that is all on the ballot. The future of our economy is at stake, of our education system is at stake. Fighting climate change and clean, renewable-energy jobs are at stake. LGBT equality is at stake. Equal pay for women is at stake. Actually, in the end, the American dream itself is at stake. So I want you to think about how you will feel on November 9th.\nAudience Member: Happy.\nSecretary Clinton: Happy. I think that's the right answer. But just suppose, just suppose you go to bed early. Suppose you go to bed early. Maybe you were too busy to vote or maybe you didn't make calls or knock on doors. I want you to imagine. So you get up early on the morning of the 9th. And you log on to the news to find out, hey, what's going on, or maybe you turn on the TV or the radio, and you hear.\nAudience Member: No!\nI want you to really understand what that means for you and for all of us because I prefer for us to be motivated by what we're for, not what we're against. But I also think it's prudent to imagine what could happen if we don't do our part. And when in the future somebody asks you, maybe your kids or your grandkids, 'What did you do when everything was on the line?' I want you to be able to say, 'I voted for a better, fairer, stronger America.'\nLet's go out and, in these next eight days, do everything we can to make it clear we're going after the kind of future that includes everybody. We're going to build this economy: new jobs, rising wages. We're going to make college affordable and help you pay down your student debt. We are going to do what will give you the best chance for your own lives and the lives of our kids and our grandkids. So if we build that future together, we will be able to say we were part of making sure that America's best days are still ahead of us. And we will prove, once and for all, that love trumps hate.\nThank you all.\"", "timestamp": "2016-10-31", "title": "Remarks at Smale Riverfront Park in Cincinnati, Ohio"}
{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119571", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n**Please see below for an addendum to the transcript, marked with an asterisk.\n1:07 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Happy Halloween. Hope you had an opportunity over the weekend to spend a little time celebrating or marking the occasion, however you choose to do so. I do not have any announcements at the top, so we can go directly to your questions.\nJosh, do you want to start?\nQ: Sure. Thanks, Josh. Let's start with the uproar over FBI Director Comey's decision to notify Congress, and therefore the public, about the new -- look at some of these emails. It seems like there's been really a bipartisan combination of that decision. The Justice Department is pretty openly saying they advised him that that was not appropriate. Eric Holder says that was the wrong decision, and the attorney generals of both parties. Without getting into the content of the investigation, which I know you can't discuss, does the President feel it was appropriate for Comey to make that public just days before the election?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Josh, I anticipated this is where you wanted to start. I appreciate you noting that over the nearly two years now that I've been answering questions about Secretary Clinton's email system, that I have made clear that the White House is going to be scrupulous about avoiding even the appearance of political interference in prosecutorial or investigative decisions. And that is a posture that I won't change and is a posture that speaks to the kind of institutional responsibilities that are vested here in the White House, which is preserving the independence and integrity of independent investigations conducted by the Department of Justice.\nNow, you've raised a question about some of the decisions that have been made to communicate information about those investigations to the public. And what's true, Josh, is that I don't have any independent knowledge of how those decisions were made. I don't know what factors were considered, dating all the way back to July, when Director Comey announced the results of the investigation and spoke at length to the public about his decision not to prosecute Secretary Clinton. Included in that news conference were some rather harsh condemnations of the way that Secretary Clinton handled that situation.\nDirector Comey also testified before Congress at some length, on camera, under oath, about the investigation. And some of that testimony provided fodder to Secretary Clinton's critics. Over the course of the fall, we've seen the FBI move forward in providing other investigative information -- 302 forms and other documents -- to Congress.\nAnd the fact is, my lack of independent knowledge about that decision-making prevents me from weighing in. So I anticipate that this is not the only question I'm going to get asked about this today, but I'll neither defend nor criticize what Director Comey has decided to communicate to the public about this investigation.\nWhat I will say is that the Department of Justice and our democracy has given the expansive authority to conduct investigations. The Department of Justice has given subpoena power. They're allowed to compel witnesses to testify. They are able to collect evidence that's not readily available necessarily. They're even allowed to impanel a grand jury. Those are substantial authorities.\nIt's important, in the mind of the President, that those authorities are tempered by an adherence to longstanding tradition and practice and norms that limit public discussion of facts that are collected in the context of those investigations. And there are a variety of good reasons for that. And the President believes that it's important for those norms and traditions and guidelines to be followed.\nQ: Were they, in this case?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think you'd have to -- I know that there's been a lot of discussion about this -- and by discussion, I mean a lot of public reporting based on a multitude of anonymous sources at the Department of Justice. The President believes that there are a set of significant institutional responsibilities that officials at the Department of Justice and the FBI must fulfill.\nThe good news is, the President believes that Director Comey is a man of integrity, he's a man of principle, and he's a man of good character. That, presumably, is the reason that President Bush chose him to serve in a senior position at the Bush administration's Department of Justice. These same character traits are what led a strong majority of Democratic and Republican senators to confirm him to this job. These are the traits that led the President to select him to be the Director of the FBI. And these are tough questions. And so it's a good thing that he's a man of integrity and character to take them on.\nQ: You'll concede, I'm sure, that in the absence of any additional information about this, voters are left to essentially speculate about what might be involved in this, what the FBI might be looking at or not looking at just before the election. So would the President, in the interest of people being able to not rely on anonymous sources and the like, see the FBI release more information than Comey did in that very brief letter prior to Election Day about what's going on?\nMR. EARNEST: Josh, in the same way that I'll neither criticize nor defend Director Comey's decisions about what to make public in the context of this investigation -- that's because I just don't have independent knowledge of the decisions that are made to release this information. And there are other people that have the luxury of being able to opine -- writing op-eds or serving as anonymous sources for reporters to weigh in with their own view -- but when I'm standing here representing the institution of the presidency, I don't have that luxury.\nAnd so in the same way that I'll neither defend nor criticize Director Comey's decisions with regard to what to make public in the context of this investigation, I don't have any recommendations to make to him either with regard to what information should be communicated to the public.\nQ: In the past, including after the FBI announced that it was not proceeding with the recommendation to bring charges in this case, the White House did defend Comey, and you've defended him a number of times. So is that a substantive shift from the language you're using today, is that you won't defend or criticize him? The fact that you're not defending him, is that some signal to us that there is reason for the White House to maintain some additional distance here?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think, Josh, what I have observed in the past is that Director Comey is a man of integrity. He's a man of principle. He's a man who is well regarded by senior officials in both parties. He's somebody who's served in a senior position in the Bush administration. And he's somebody who got strong bipartisan support when his nomination to be the Director of the FBI was considered by the United States Senate.\nSo all those things are true. They speak to his good character. And the President's assessment of his integrity and his character has not changed. For example, the President doesn't believe that Director Comey is intentionally trying to influence the outcome of an election. The President doesn't believe that he's secretly strategizing to benefit one candidate or one political party. He's in a tough spot, and he's the one who will be in a position to defend his actions in the face of significant criticism from a variety of legal experts, including individuals who served in senior Department of Justice positions in administrations that were led by presidents in both parties.\nBut that kind of -- but I'm just not going to be in a position to, frankly, either defend or criticize the decisions that he's made with what regard -- with regard to what to communicate in public. That is separate, Josh, from the kind of prosecutorial and investigative decisions that are made by the FBI and the Department of Justice. That is their institutional responsibility -- to make those decisions about investigations and prosecutions independent of any sort of political interference, and I will defend their right to do that. In fact, it's their responsibility.\nQ: This decision aside, is it concerning at all to the White House that you have the Justice Department and the FBI basically griping at each other in some form of public or semi-public fashion? I mean, they obviously have to work very closely together to keep the country safe. Is there an issue there that needs to be resolved so that the Justice Department isn't accusing the FBI of not following proper procedures?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Josh, you've heard me discuss the President's view of Director Comey's integrity and character. Let me just tell you that the President has got a lot of confidence in the Attorney General of the United States, Loretta Lynch, to run that Department. And she is somebody who spent decades as a career prosecutor. She's not new to any of this. A lot of that work was done when she was the head of the Eastern District of New York, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York. That is a position where these kinds of decisions are closely scrutinized by the media that's based in the largest city in our country.\nSo she's used to this kind of pressure. And the President has got complete confidence in her ability to handle this situation responsibly and consistent with the institutional responsibilities that are vested with the Department of Justice.\nQ: And one other question on a topic that I know is difficult to talk about for another reason. The President's half-brother, Malik Obama, has published an op-ed, I suppose, in a New York newspaper, essentially airing a list of grievances against the President, saying he wasn't -- he hasn't sufficiently supported his family in Kenya, didn't send condolences after his half-brother's sons -- or children passed away. And he ends by saying, \"I will not be humiliated anymore.\" Does the President have any thoughts about that op-ed or about the fact that this family issue is playing out so publicly?\nMR. EARNEST: Josh, I have to admit that I have not seen the op-ed that you're referring to. If we have an official reaction to it, I can follow up with you. I spoke to the President the series of questions that you started the briefing with, but I had not read the op-ed, so I did not ask him about this one. But we'll follow up with you.\nAyesha.\nQ: Thanks. Going back to the FBI. You said that you don't have enough -- or the White House does not have enough independent information to either criticize or to come out with a position on Comey's letter. But then I guess what do you say to the American people? If the White House doesn't have enough information to decide whether the letter was appropriate or not, seemingly the American people are then left with questions about what to believe. There are lots of criticism right now from both sides, or lots of calls from both sides of the aisle asking Director Comey to release more information. Do you feel that the American people don't have a right to more information about this probe? I mean, they are going to the voting booths right now and next Tuesday.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, Ayesha, this is an entirely legitimate question for you to ask, and I think these are the kinds of questions that are being carefully considered at the Department of Justice right now. And given the institutional responsibilities that are vested here at the White House, I just don't have a recommendation to make.\nIt's important for them to make these decisions consistent with their -- let me be more precise here. It's important for officials at the Department of Justice and the FBI to make these decisions consistent with their institutional responsibilities.\nAnd as I made reference to earlier, those officials at the Department of Justice and the FBI are given expansive authority and expansive powers to intrude on the privacy of private citizens. And that authority is tempered by longstanding traditions and norms and guidelines that largely avoid extensive public discussion of those investigations.\nLet me give you an example that I think will resonate with all of you, based on your day-to-day responsibilities here at White House. It is not uncommon for you, when you call the Department of Justice asking them to even confirm that there's an investigation ongoing, for them to decline to do that. Typically, when you report about the fact that there's an ongoing investigation, that's not based on official confirmation you've received from an official at the Department of Justice; it's based on confirmation you've received from an anonymous official at the Department of Justice who's not willing to speak publicly about the case because it would be improper for them to do so.\nThat, I think, in a way that we all -- in a way that reflects the reality of the world that we all work in on a day-to-day basis, I think that underscores the sensitivity of discussing this information.\nNow, the other thing I think that's important to consider here is there is a tendency to say -- with regard to this letter that was written on Friday -- to say, well, Congress is independent and they have their own independent oversight responsibilities to exercise over the Department of Justice.\nWell, let me say a couple of things about that. The first is, the kinds of norms and traditions that limit the public disclosure of investigations don't supersede the oversight responsibilities or requests that are submitted by members of Congress. And the reason for that is simple. Congress is, indeed, independent of the executive branch, but they're far from impartial. Congress is made up of 535 politicians, Democrats and Republicans. And we've already seen just in the last 72 hours the kind of risk that's associated with communicating to them sensitive information.\nThere's one senior Republican official who's already indicated -- who had previously endorsed the Republican nominee for President, who let it slip that his party was considering impeaching President Clinton even before she's been elected, if she's elected. That, I think, is a pretty clear indication that Congress is not at all impartial. And that's why many of these norms, longstanding norms -- that apply even when we're not talking about someone famous, and even when we're not talking about an election being a week and a half away -- that should apply. And the President believes that these norms are important and worth upholding.\nQ: So the President believes these norms are worth upholding, but it seems like in this case, Comey -- these letters -- that's what people are saying, is that these norms weren't upheld. We're talking about an ongoing investigation because a letter was sent. So I guess I'm trying to parse out, so where does the White House stand on that, just as a general issue, having an ongoing investigation that is now being discussed?\nMR. EARNEST: And look, this goes to the fact that because we have worked to shield this investigation, given the politically sensitive nature of it. Well, frankly, even it weren't politically sensitive, we would go to great lengths, we would be scrupulous about insulating that independent investigation from even the appearance of political interference.\nSo I don't have any independent knowledge of the investigation or the kinds of decisions that led Director Comey to take the steps that he did to communicate some of this investigation -- or some of the material relevant to this investigation to the Congress and to the public.\nSo, again, I'm not in a position to either defend or criticize that decision. That's something that officials at the Department of Justice and the FBI have to do.\nQ: So Senator Reid said that the FBI has some explosive information regarding Trump and Russian ties. And basically he is accusing the FBI of having a double standard and not releasing information like that. And he and other Democratic lawmakers have called for the FBI to release that information. Does the White House have any position on that? Are you concerned that now you have more, kind of, accusations going around about FBI probes?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, as I mentioned before, the White House has not been briefed on the investigation that the Department of Justice and the FBI were conducting into Secretary Clinton's email system. The White House has not been briefed on even the existence of any investigation into the activities or habits of the Republican nominee. These are all questions that should be directed to the Department of Justice and to the FBI.\nToluse.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Going back to Senator Reid's letter, he basically accused the FBI Director of potentially violating the Hatch Act. And you said that you believe that Director Comey is a man of integrity. In the letter that Senator Reid sent, he said that he once believed that Director Comey was a principled servant, and he now no longer believes that. So what is your reaction to that letter, and do you agree with Senator Reid on this?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, questions about the application of the Hatch Act should be directed to the Office of Special Counsel. This is an independent agency that is filled with attorneys and investigators who, among their responsibilities, are investigating potential violations of the Hatch Act. But, again, you'll have to talk to them to even confirm the existence of an investigation, let alone learn more about what they have concluded.\nWith regard to Director Comey, as I said at the top, the President believes that he's a man of integrity, he's a man of character, he's a man of principle, and he's got a very difficult job. And those character traits that I just described will serve him well as he works through the difficult challenges that he faces over the course of his job.\nQ: You said you spoke to the President earlier today. Can you describe his mood, how he's taking the general news? Obviously, there's a political side to this, and we saw Secretary Clinton and her campaign reacting very strongly to this. Did the President have that same level of sort of visceral reaction to how this is impacting the election?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Toluse, with regard to the impact on the election, I think there's a lot of speculation out there in terms of what potential impact this could have. Based on the public evidence that I have seen from polls and other analysis, there hasn't been a significant change in the race. There are probably some analysts who disagree with that; maybe they're right.\nI think what those of you who have been covering the President for a while now know that the President is somebody who is pretty even-keeled. He doesn't get too high or too low. And he has a tendency to focus on the responsibilities that he has in front of him. And the President feels strongly -- as you've heard him say -- about supporting Secretary Clinton's campaign. And over the course of the next week, the President has put together a rather aggressive travel schedule to make the case to the American public in support of the candidate that he's endorsed. That's what the President is focused on, and that's -- I would not anticipate a significant change to the public pitch that President Obama will be making in support of Secretary Clinton's campaign.\nQ: You also mentioned longstanding guidelines that the FBI has about discussing ongoing investigations. There are also longstanding guidelines about taking actions that could be seen as influencing an election so close to an election. Is that something that the President is concerned about? Is that something that the President believes, as many Democrats do, was undermined in this case?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, those kinds of guidelines are important. I'd refer you to the Department of Justice and the FBI for how those guidelines are observed and enforced. But I think the President is every bit as concerned about the broader principle, which is the Department of Justice is entrusted with expansive responsibilities, and those responsibilities are tempered with guidelines and traditions that limit the public discussion of the investigations. And the President believes that that principle, those guidelines, are applicable, even when there's not an election around the corner, even when one individual who was affected by the investigation is not a global figure. And the President believes it's important for everybody to be mindful of those guidelines.\nRon.\nQ: So if he's insisted the President -- that these norms -- that public discussion should be limited, even when there's not an election around, he certainly believes that public discussion of an investigation should be limited when there is an election nearby. Is that a fair conclusion to draw?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, let me just restate it to make sure that I understand your question.\nQ: The question is, essentially, are you saying the President believes that there should be very limited discussion of investigations near an election?\nMR. EARNEST: The President believes that our democracy has been very well served for more than two centuries by officials at the Department of Justice and the FBI observing longstanding traditions that limit public discussion of investigations whether an election is around the corner or not.\nQ: So how can he agree or not criticize what Director Comey has done? It seems like a clear -- it's a public discussion of an investigation. I mean, you point out how we can't even get confirmation that an investigation is happening.\nMR. EARNEST: Yeah.\nQ: This seems like a very clear-cut -- based on what you're saying about the President's concerns about the broader principles, it seems that it would be very clear that he would be critical of what Director Comey has done.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it is clear what Director Comey has done. What's not clear is what led to that decision. And nobody at the White House has insight into the decision that Director Comey made --\nQ: Right, but -- so you're saying there could be some mitigating factor that we don't know about that would essentially allow somebody to breach this broad principle of limited public discussion of the investigation?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not being that prescriptive. I am basically suggesting I'm not aware of any of the factors that went into Director Comey's decision to send this letter to Congress on Friday. I'm not aware of the factors that went into his decision to give a long public statement on July 5th, when he announced that he was not going to recommend the prosecution of Secretary Clinton. I'm not aware of the factors that went into his decision to testify before Congress for several hours, under oath, in discussing his investigation. And I'm not aware of what kind of factors influence his decision to release the summaries of investigative interviews that were conducted by FBI officials in the context of this investigation.\nQ: But, Josh, at some point, you just kind of break this all down to just common sense. I mean, people all over the country -- friends, family are talking about all this. I mean, how in any way can this be good for the country at this point in time?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, what is important is that people across the country and former administration officials have more of a luxury to be able to step back and weigh in from the sidelines, to offer up their own opinion based on their own experience, based on their own training, based on their own observation about the impact that this has on the our political process. There's nothing wrong with that. That is part of the kind of debate that is critical to the success of our democracy, as well.\nBut what's important for the person that's standing behind the podium with the White House seal behind me is to make sure that I'm observing the institutional responsibilities that I have and that everybody who works here has, including the President of the United States, which is that we're not going to be in a position of defending or criticizing the decisions that were made by the Director of the FBI with regard to communicating information from the investigations.\nQ: I see that. But you're saying so much that could be interpreted as critical of what he's done. Are you aware of that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm certainly giving voice to longstanding guidelines that have served our democracy well, that the President believes are really important. And I recognize that those guidelines have been the basis for other people to offer up their criticism of Director Comey. It's a free country; they're certainly allowed to do that. But from here, I'm not going to be in a position of criticizing Director Comey about those decisions, in part because I don't have any independent knowledge of how those decisions were made. That's also the reason, by the way, I'm not going to defend him either.\nQ: Did the President read the Eric Holder op-ed letter?\nMR. EARNEST: There have been a lot of opinions that have been shared in public over the last 48 hours or so.\nQ: Eric Holder -- this is a --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, my point is that I know the President is aware of this issue and he's read about many of the opinions that have been expressed in the last 72 hours. But I don't know whether or not he saw that particular op-ed.\nQ: And lastly, when you were talking about Loretta Lynch, you said something about how the President has confidence in her, and so on and so forth. But when you were talking about Director Comey, you talked about how he's a man of integrity, character, principle that will serve him. Are you saying there something different? Does the President not have -- does the President still have confidence in Director Comey?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not trying to send a signal here. The President is somebody who, three years ago, nominated Director Comey because he's a man of character, he's a man of integrity, he's a man of principle. He is somebody who's had a distinguished legal career that's been rooted in making sure that his own political views don't interfere with his responsibilities as an attorney or as a law enforcement officer.\nSo, look, the President thinks very highly of Director Comey. And, yes, you can assert that he continues to have confidence in his ability to do his job.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Given the President's mantra for no drama and don't do stupid stuff, I just have to wonder where he is on this email --\nMR. EARNEST: Thank you for editing yourself, by the way. (Laughter.) This is a family program here, Kevin.\nQ: You're absolutely right. It goes on and on and on. And I'm just wondering, given what you said earlier about wanting to scrupulously avoid any appearance of impropriety, do you believe, or would the President believe now is the time for a special prosecutor in this circumstance?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, no, the President hasn't reached that conclusion at all. As I mentioned earlier, the investigation that was conducted by the Department of Justice and the FBI was a thorough one and one that Director Comey, for better or worse, has thoroughly explained.\nAnd I don't think that after considering what Director Comey has put forward that anybody would conclude that he somehow gave short shrift to answering the questions that were posed in the context of the investigation. Again, that's all based on his public statements. The White House nor I, nor anybody here, has been briefed on those investigations. But based on his public statements, I think it's quite clear that a thorough investigation has been conducted.\nAnd that investigation was conducted free of any sort of political interference from the White House. There are another set of decisions that were made with regard to communicating information from that investigation to the public. And as I mentioned earlier, I'll neither criticize nor defend the decisions to make that information public or to communicate it to Congress.\nQ: You want to be careful not to criticize, but I'm curious, do you see it as partisan in any way?\nMR. EARNEST: No. As I mentioned earlier, the President has got confidence that Director Comey --\nQ: Because that's how some people are shading it. Early on, especially back in July, there were a number of, maybe, on the right who were suggesting that, you know what, he didn't listen to his staff, he should have proceeded with an indictment. And now, here, over the last 72 hours, many on the left are suggesting he did this right before the election, it was completely out of bounds. There is this narrative that some people feel like somehow the Director, rightly or wrongly, has been partisan. Does the President acknowledge?\nMR. EARNEST: The President is completely confident that Director Comey has not taken any steps to try to intentionally influence the outcome of the election or to advantage one candidate or one political party.\nQ: Let me ask you about the emails. And I know you and I can't talk about some of the specifics, but I'm just curious about the Huma Abedin shared email account with Anthony Weiner, former congressman. Is there any reason that the White House has any concern that the President's emails may have ended up on that computer in any way?\nMR. EARNEST: I think as has been -- if the public reports are true, nobody knows what's on that computer. And I'm not going to speculate about what may or may not be there.\nQ: Can you answer this question, then: Is there reason the President would use an alias or a pseudonym when emailing back and forth with members of Congress in particular, or even with the former Secretary of State? Is that true? And if so, why?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know that the President emails with members of Congress. What I can tell you is that the President's email system has a lot of built-in security measures, including an alias. And as we've discussed in here before, it would be foolish to give the President the BObama@whitehouse.gov email address.\nQ: So it's not Barack.Obama? (Laughter.) Not that I haven't tried that one. (Laughter.)\nLet me lastly ask you about something that, again, I know your usual pivot is these are private emails that were obtained illegally or surreptitiously, but I do think it bears the question about the suggestion that Donna Brazile, the acting DNC leader, taking over for the now-deposed Debbie Wasserman Schultz, may have been aiding the Clinton campaign with more questions leading up to town hall events and other sort of -- giving her an inside scoop. What do you say to those Bernie Sanders backers who feel like the fix was in from the very outset? And should Donna Brazile, in your opinion, if this turns out to be true, step down from her position at the DNC?\nMR. EARNEST: No. The President believes that she's done a fine job stepping in in a very difficult situation to lead the Democratic Party. Those of us who have known Donna a long time know that she is a person of integrity and a person of high character. She's a true professional who is a tenacious and effective advocate for Democrats. And she uses that skill regularly on television. She has been using that skill regularly as a party official. And I, for one, am pretty excited about the fact that we've got her on our team.\nQ: Last question. I just want to make sure I drill down on your answer. If it turns out that she did tip the scales or put her hand on the scale for Secretary Clinton, and didn't handle it evenly as a member of the leadership of the DNC, that's okay with you?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't think she was a leader of the -- on the DNC leadership at the time of the debates. I think during the -- my understanding is -- and you should check with the DNC on this -- but that during the primary, she was not affiliated with the DNC. *[Brazile was serving as a Vice Chair of the DNC.]\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, has the President spoken with Attorney General Lynch about this issue and her apparent disagreement with the FBI Director?\nMR. EARNEST: He has not.\nQ: And when exactly did the White House find out about the FBI letter?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as my colleague, Eric, in answering this question last week told you all, the White House was not given advance knowledge of the decision by the FBI Director to submit this letter to Congress. So we learned about this letter the same time all of you did.\nQ: Through the media?\nMR. EARNEST: That's correct.\nQ: When you were speaking earlier, you used the language, saying the President did not believe that Comey intentionally is trying to influence the election. The former AG, Eric Holder, said that this is a serious error with potentially severe implications. Whether or not this was intentional, is there concern that this could have, indeed, potentially severe implications?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we certainly have already seen some of Secretary Clinton's harshest critics capitalize on this letter, distort its contents to provoke controversy. I made a reference earlier to the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee who committed the classic Washington gaffe of saying something in public that everyone secretly knows is true, which is that House Republicans are already plotting the impeachment of Hillary Clinton, even though she hasn't even been elected President yet. That was based on questions that he was receiving about the letter.\nIn the same interview, he referred to substantial information being included in those emails. At the time that he gave that statement, public reports indicated that the Director of the FBI hadn't even had an opportunity to review those emails. I think that's exhibit A of how partisans in Congress have sought political advantage through the disclosure of this information. That's why these kinds of guidelines are so important. And that's why adherence to these guidelines has served our country so well for a long time. The strength of our democracy depends on it.\nQ: But the President previously has said he thought Hillary Clinton displayed some carelessness here, but that her use of private email system and server didn't jeopardize national security. He has weighed in on this generally, as saying this is a little bit of a distraction. Does he still believe that?\nMR. EARNEST: The President's views of this situation have not changed. Again, I think the focus of so much of our discussion today has been on the decision made by officials at the Department of Justice and the FBI to talk about this investigation in public.\nQ: But the premise of the investigation itself he's somewhat been dismissive of by using that language, saying it didn't jeopardize national security to begin with -- it was careless, not criminal. So to be dismissing the premise of the investigation, but then -- I mean, is this all just procedural items that you think this hubbub is about at this time?\nMR. EARNEST: Even when making those comments, the President specified in the same interview, in response to the same question, that the Department of Justice had at the time and continues to have a responsibility to follow the facts where they lead. This is why we ask career prosecutors to set aside their own political views and their political interests to pursue these kinds of investigations.\nThis is what the nature of an independent investigation is, which is that even though -- so this is the best way I think to describe the situation -- it's no secret that President Obama is a strong and enthusiastic supporter of Secretary Clinton. But he also expects the Department of Justice, including some of the officials that he appointed, like the Attorney General and the FBI, to fulfill their basic responsibilities -- even if that means investigating a candidate for President that he's endorsed. That's the President's commitment to his institutional responsibilities as President of the United States -- to set aside his own political views from his institutional responsibilities. And his institutional responsibility is, don't interfere with a DOJ investigation. And that's something that we have scrupulously followed.\nQ: So does that mean that the President will avoid mentioning this issue in any and all campaign events for the next few weeks?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, fortunately, there's only another week or so to go. (Laughter.) I think I speak for everybody in here when I say that. But yes, I would anticipate that the President will speak publicly quite a bit over the course of this week. I would not expect a dramatic change to the President's speech that you all have heard him deliver, indicating his very strong support for Secretary Clinton in his view that the outcome of this election is critically important to the future of the country.\nQ: But will he make a pointed decision to avoid commenting on this because of all the concerns about --\nMR. EARNEST: Again, the President, prior to Friday's letter, was not spending a lot of time dwelling on this topic, and I wouldn't anticipate a significant change to his stump speech.\nQ: And lastly, I just want to come back to the Harry Reid question about what he was implying about Donald Trump and the Russian government. Since the DNI has said that there was a Russian effort from the top down to influence the election, when you said that you haven't been briefed on whether there is an actual connection to the Republican nominee. If there were information along these lines, is this the kind of thing that should be disclosed prior to the election?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think this sort of falls into the category of a decision that has to be made by officials at the Department of Justice and the FBI. They can speak to whether or not there's an investigation that's ongoing. If there is, they can speak to what that investigation has uncovered. And ultimately it will be up to them to decide, consistent with the guidelines that I've laid out, how much of that investigation to make public, if any.\nQ: But you don't think hear they're withholding information as is being implied here by Harry Reid?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, it's just hard for me to say that because I don't know whether there's actually an investigation even ongoing.\nKenneth.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. So just to confirm and clarify, everything the White House has learned to date about the latest probe by the FBI on Hillary Clinton's -- these newly discovered emails has been through media reports? There hasn't been a letter? There hasn't been any type of call? This has all been through media reports?\nMR. EARNEST: So, Kenneth, let me just be as precise as I possibly can here. The White House was not given advance notice of the fact that the Department of Justice was sending a letter to Capitol Hill. The White House became aware of that letter through media reports when individuals in Congress presumably made the decision to make that letter public. And since then, the Department of Justice has not provided any sort of briefing or consultation -- or sought any consultation with the White House about this matter moving forward.\nQ: Josh, you mentioned there are a lot of people on the sidelines -- former officials who have the luxury, you said, to comment about this. But some of these folks are not on the sidelines; they're active in government. You mentioned Harry Reid, who said that he deeply regrets fighting to confirm Comey. Obviously, you're saying that the White House is standing behind -- standing with Comey on this. So what's your response to people who are, even in your own party, top leaders, who say they regret fighting to confirm Comey to be FBI director?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, just to real precise about this, with regard to Director Comey's decision to send this letter to Congress, I'll neither defend nor criticize that decision. I recognize that there are a lot of other people who have, and they certainly are entitled to do that. But based on the institutional constraints that I have, standing here at this podium in front of the White House logo, I don't have that luxury.\nSo I'll let other people weigh in. The President's view is that Director Comey is a man of integrity, he's a man of character. He is not attempting to influence the election to benefit or advantage one political party or one candidate for office. He's got a tough job, and hopefully he'll draw on that character and integrity as he does it.\nQ: So there's a lot of talk about Comey after this. Obviously, his term continues well into the next President. So what is this administration's advice to Hillary Clinton if she wins on working with a man who has now investigated her, seemingly, at least twice in the public?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I'm not going to speculate about the outcome at this point. The President is focused on -- over the course of this week, he'll be focused on making a case for her because he feels strongly about her candidacy, and the stakes that are -- the stakes in this election for the future of the country. But I'm not going to speculate about what sort of advice the President would have for President-elect Clinton. We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.\nQ: And finally for me, does the President have a costume to wear today? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Well, you all will have an opportunity to see him when he's passing out candy on the South Lawn later today, so stay tuned. I'll just say in the past, the President has not worn a costume when he's passing out candy. (Laughter.) But I did not ask him today if he was going to change that practice, that longstanding guideline and norm. (Laughter.)\nMichelle.\nQ: I mean, we hear you defending both Comey and the Attorney General, which is interesting because they could not be more opposed on the release of this information and the timing of it. And so to hear the Attorney General -- I mean, sources within the Department saying that the release of this and the timing runs contrary to procedures, to hear Eric Holder saying that this is a \"stunning breach of protocol,\" \"violates longstanding policies.\" I know you don't want to take sides here, you're not going to do that, but doesn't that chasm between the views here of the FBI and the Justice Department at the very least raise a concern here?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, there has been a multitude of anonymous voices in the media over the last 48 to 72 hours sharing their own perspective and opinion about this situation. Some of those are anonymous voices who are identified as people who currently work in the United States government. The sharing of their anonymous opinion is not particularly helpful. And I think there was -- again, based on the letter that Director Comey sent to employees at the FBI, his letter was intended to clarify actions that the FBI was taking. But based on the fact that Director Comey felt like he had to send that letter to agency employees I think is an indication that the letter had the opposite of the intended effect. And the void has been filled by a lot of anonymous voices that haven't served the public interest either.\nSo again, it's still a free country. And particularly people who, based on their previous experience in government or based on their own legal expertise, have an opinion and a view, and it's clear in a modern media environment, they have a variety of ways to share it. But for somebody that's got institutional responsibilities like the President, or somebody who's got institutional responsibilities like me, who speaks for the President, I don't have the luxury of weighing in, in the same way.\nQ: Eric Holder obviously is not an anonymous voice, and someone who was so recently in that office, using such strong language about this -- not based on solely his political leanings and beliefs, but based on procedure and guidance that was in effect while he was there -- doesn't that worry the President?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President believes strongly in those kinds of guidelines too. I can't recite Mr. Holder's op-ed from memory, and I don't have it in front of me, but the kinds of guidelines and norms and traditions that he was giving voice to in his op-ed are the kinds of traditions and norms that the President has in mind when talking about the responsibility that everybody at the Department of Justice and the FBI has to live up to them.\nAnd those norms are important because they protect the rights of people who are being investigated. And that's important even in situations where somebody who is affected by an investigation is not famous, and even when there's not an election around the corner.\nSo at the end of the day, officials at the Department of Justice and the FBI have a responsibility to live up to those traditions and to follow them. And the President's expectation is that they will do that.\nQ: Okay, so given that you do see this stark difference -- even if you're not listening to anonymous voices, even if you're just listening to Eric Holder, who said that was a hard op-ed for him to write because he also respects Comey -- and you hear top Democrats calling for the release of more information, to put out the full facts, including the candidate calling for that -- isn't that something that the White House would welcome? There's so much controversy surrounding this, and it's not good for who the President wants to be elected. So would not the White House say, let's put more information out there then?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, Michelle, I think that -- as I mentioned earlier, I think that was the hope that Director Comey had. That was his stated hope of sending the letter in the first place.\nQ: But clearly it's not enough.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, clearly, it had the opposite of the intended effect. I think we can all agree on that. And again, I can't -- other than what he has -- other than what Director Comey has written in his letter to agency employees or employees of the Bureau, I can't speak to what factors he considered in making the decision to send that letter in the first place. And I just can't be in a position of speculating about what may have led him to make that decision.\nQ: Given what has happened, given the effect that you talked about that was likely the opposite of the intended effect, wouldn't you then welcome more information to throw some more clarity on that?\nMR. EARNEST: I think, as is evident from the last 72 hours of media coverage, Director Comey is getting advice from a variety of perspectives. I don't have any advice to share. I'm not even sure that he'd be that interested in it, even if I did.\nQ: Okay. And I have a lot of questions, sorry.\nMR. EARNEST: That's fine.\nQ: When we heard the President in a call talk to supporters of Hillary Clinton and tell them to avoid all the noise and distraction that's out there, doesn't he think that what's happening now with the FBI reopening an investigation, isn't that more than noise and distraction? And if he thinks it is noise and distraction, isn't he then weighing in essentially on what he thinks this is all about or what he thinks is at the core of this?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think the President's intent of using that admonition in the call that he did yesterday with Secretary Clinton's supporters is to remind people why they got involved in her election in the first place; to remind them of why he got involved in support of her election in the first place.\nHe cares deeply about the future of the country. He cares deeply about making sure that his successor is somebody who shares the values and the vision that he's been fighting for, for the last eight years. Somebody who is committed to growing our economy from the middle out, who is committed to making sure that America is a place that's fair and just for everyone. Making sure that we're being smart and judicious about what's necessary to advance our interests around the world; about confronting the reality of climate change; about making sure expanding access to health care for every American.\nThese are the kinds of principles and values that President Obama has championed. Those are the things that drew the President to public service in the first place. Those are the things that drew him to support Secretary Clinton in the first place. And presumably, those are the kinds of things that actually motivated people to sign up and get involved and volunteer for Secretary Clinton's campaign. And that's what the President is encouraging those people to focus on.\nQ: So is what's happening now with the FBI and everything that's being said out there, is it noise and distraction only?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I don't want to be perceived as dismissing this, primarily because I also don't want to be in a position of being perceived as either criticizing Director Comey for the decision to release this information, but I also don't want to be in a position of leading people to think that I'm defending his decision to release this information. This was a decision for him to make, and the President believes that those kinds of decisions should be made in consultation with other officials at the Department of Justice and with due consideration given to longstanding norms and principles and traditions that have served our country well.\nQ: Okay. And this is the last one, I promise. You talked about the President -- his pitch, his public pitch not changing as he goes out on the trail for the last week this week. But what we heard from him as recently as Friday is not the making the crowd laugh like it's a comedy routine, not making fun of Donald Trump. He sounded deadly serious, first of all, which sounded like a difference -- in my opinion, at least. And also, instead of him talking about -- like he did in the beginning of the campaign -- that America is not so divided as people say it is, he was talking about a polarized America. So isn't that a change in kind of how he's seeing things at this point in the race?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Michelle, I can assure you that the President's speech that he gave on Friday in Florida was not changed in light of the news that Director Comey's letter made earlier that afternoon.\nLook, I think all of the arguments that the President made in Friday's speech are at least consistent with the arguments that he's been making on the campaign trail for a couple of months now. Yes, on some occasions the President has spent more time dwelling on the reasons that he has not endorsed the Republican nominee. But in this case, he spent more time dwelling on the reasons that he's strongly supportive of the Democratic nominee and illustrating the stakes of this election, which are -- in his view -- as high as they've ever been.\nQ: Has this election made him rethink that America is not so divided as people say it is?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, earlier this year, the President gave a State of the Union address in which he acknowledged that our country has not made as much progress as he would have liked to have seen over the course of his presidency in bridging some of the political divides. I think when it comes to our values and our notion of what it means to be American, a commitment to a set of values that -- or the foundation of the forming of this country, I think there's a broad consensus about the importance of those values. And sometimes that consensus is overshadowed by more narrow political disagreements.\nThat's not to minimize the significance of those political disagreements, because the President believes that it's really important that the candidate that he's endorsed prevail in this election. And he'll be making that case accordingly. But this is not the first time the President has made the observation that the country is a little bit more divided and our debate is a little more polarized than he would prefer.\nApril.\nQ: Josh, a couple of questions. One, you talk about the integrity of Comey and others, but I want to ask you right now with this current election cycle and these current revelations over the last couple of days, is there still integrity in this election process?\nMR. EARNEST: April, there's no reason -- as we've discussed before in a variety of contexts -- there's no reason for anybody to call into question the ability of our democracy to count the vote of every eligible voter that exercises that right on Election Day or before. This is a -- our system of conducting elections and our democracy has persisted and prevailed through a Civil War, through two World Wars, through a Cold War. And we've got a vigorous election that's underway now and a vigorous political debate that, in some cases, has trended toward the divisive. But the President has confidence in the ability of our system of government to succeed in ensuring that the outcome of the election reflects the will of the people who show up to vote.\nQ: But what I'm specifically speaking about is the break in tradition -- 11 days out, or how many days it was -- to have this revelation, this letter to the Congress. And the FBI Director, who had already investigated and found that he was not going to charge her. Is there still integrity, do you believe, in this process? As people are early voting --\nMR. EARNEST: When you say \"this process,\" tell me what process you mean.\nQ: The early voting process. This election process.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, it's not been affected.\nQ: Okay. All right. Now, when it comes to the President, was there ever any conversation about the possibility of not allowing the President to go with the revelation of this letter going to Congress -- going out on the road for her the next couple of days?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm sorry, I don't think I understand your question. Can you --\nQ: Was there ever any consideration of not letting the President go out on the road to campaign for Hillary Clinton after this latest Comey letter came out?\nMR. EARNEST: No, not at all. There's no schedule change contemplated at all.\nQ: And now with him going out again -- as you said, no schedule change -- do you believe that the President feels that, because he is a constitutional attorney and understands the law from his (inaudible) -- do you believe that the President feels that, like in July, that Hillary Clinton will be found not to have I guess made a national security breach, or not charged or indicted? Does he believe that, as he's getting ready to embark on a road trip for her for her presidency?\nMR. EARNEST: The President continues to be completely confident. I'm not going to comment on an ongoing FBI or Department of Justice process. But what I will reiterate is the President's confidence in Secretary Clinton, in her values, in her leadership qualities. The President's assessment that she would be an excellent candidate, that she would be an excellent President and that she is the right person to succeed him in the Oval Office has not changed. And you've heard him talk about that quite extensively over the last couple of months, and you're going to hear him talk about it quite a bit over the course of the next week.\nRichard.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. So if the President's opinion hasn't changed, just a clarification again for me. Did the President feel that, as Director Comey said, that Secretary Clinton showed recklessness with her private emails? Did he use that term -- is carelessness a part of and include recklessness?\nMR. EARNEST: The President has had an occasion to talk about this previously. I don't have anything to add to what the President has previously said. I think the President, as I have on a number of occasions, has noted that Secretary Clinton has acknowledged that it was a mistake. She's acknowledged -- she's apologized for making that mistake, and she's acknowledged that if she had an opportunity to do it over again, she'd do it a lot differently.\nBut with regard to the President's opinion of Secretary Clinton and his firm belief that she will be an excellent President, that assessment has not changed.\nQ: This campaign -- the Clinton campaign has come out with a new ad where they depict the daisy girl image. You've been with the White House for eight years. You do think one man being the President can, by himself, start a nuclear war?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there is enormous authority that's invested in the commander-in-chief. And choosing a commander-in-chief with the right temperament has been the subject of presidential campaigns for -- let me say it this way -- this is not the first time that there has been an extensive debate on the campaign trail about whether or not one of the candidates has the right temperament to be commander-in-chief. So I'll let the Clinton campaign make whatever case they choose to make.\nYou've heard the President talk in his own words in these speeches about how important it is to have the right temperament when doing this job, and he says that based on his own personal experience of sitting in that office every day for the last eight years. So the President's views about how important the consideration of temperament is in choosing the next commander-in-chief is something that he's talked about extensively. And it sounds like the Clinton campaign wants to talk about that, too. But you should talk to them about that strategy.\nQ: You've seen the President discuss issues, going to war in Iraq or in Afghanistan, the surge and putting soldiers on the ground.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes. These are life and death decisions. They don't just --\nQ: Exactly. Can one man just, without even talking to anybody around -- can the President of the U.S. start, himself, a war -- a nuclear war?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't know that I can walk through the procedures that are involved for making that kind of decision --\nQ: My question is, is that exaggerated in trying to portray this?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't think it's exaggerated, because the person who is the commander-in-chief is somebody who's calling the shots. And there's a longstanding tradition in this country -- a different tradition, but a longstanding tradition -- of civilian leadership of the military. And for the person who is entrusted with that responsibility by the American people, that's the person that's making decisions that members of the military -- they're giving orders that members of the military vow to uphold and vow to carry out.\nSo, again, I can't speak to the procedures for the kind of operation that you're alluding to. But I think the point of this debate is helping the American people understand that it's enormously important who the next President of the United States is. And that is a -- lives are at stake in making that decision because the President frequently has to make life-and-death decisions. And typically, when those decisions are being weighed, they're not even one person's life and death. We're talking about the life and death of, for example, thousands of American servicemembers who signed up to serve this country in the military. Those servicemembers are entrusting their lives to the Commander-in-Chief. And the President feels that responsibility, and it's a weighty one.\nDave.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I wanted to go back on Toluse's question about the mood, the reaction to Comey's announcement on Friday. I mean, you're talking about, obviously, the candidate that the President wants very deeply to succeed him and carry out a lot of his agenda. A lot of -- some White House -- top White House people have gone to work for Hillary Clinton's campaign in the last year or so. And so obviously, a lot of people here at the White House, it's no surprise, are rooting for her to win. Then you got this major, negative news story out of the blue, as you said, 10 days before the election. What was the reaction here among senior-level people? Were you concerned? Were you shocked?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as I mentioned, the White House was not notified of the decision to send this letter to Congress before the letter was made public. So I guess it's fair to say that since we didn't know about it in advance, that we were surprised, particularly when you consider the kind of longstanding tradition that's been observed by investigators and prosecutors in our democracy for a long time.\nBut, look, I think the broader analysis of the impact of this story on the race I think is much more complicated than just describing it as a bad story. I think there are a variety of opinions about what potential impact this could have on the electorate -- who's motivated, who's discouraged.\nQ: But for example, there was a poll yesterday, I think it was ABC, that said up to one-third of voters are now, because of this story, considered less likely to vote for Hillary Clinton. Doesn't that concern you guys?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think there's a lot of analysis and a lot of data out there to sift through, and I'm sure there are people in the Trump campaign headquarters and in the Clinton campaign headquarters sifting through that data right now to search for a political advantage. That's what they're supposed to do. But I'll leave the analysis to them and to others who are talking to journalists. I'll let others carry that analysis.\nQ: One other matter, about the VA. The good folks at USA Today had a story today about bonuses that were awarded to VA employees in fiscal 2015 -- some $177 million to VA employees, about 189,000 employees, which was an increase from the year before by about 24 percent. Given the year that the VA has had, does the President feel like they were due for an increase in bonuses that were handed out?\nMR. EARNEST: Dave, I haven't seen the story. Let me look into the story and we'll follow up with you with a response.\nScott.\nQ: Josh, the President is going to make two separate trips to North Carolina this week. He's going to Florida for the third time in three weeks. Can you talk a little of the calculation that the White House and the Clinton campaign put into where they allocate the President's time?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this is a question that you should direct to the Clinton campaign. They're making -- the President's directive to his team here is to figure out what he can do to be most helpful to Secretary Clinton. And so those decisions about where the President will travel are being driven by the strategists at the Clinton campaign.\nThe observation that I will make is that it is not uncommon in a national election for the outcome to be -- for a couple of states, for a handful of states to be viewed as likely to decide the outcome. And typically that means that the two competing candidates will often find themselves in the same city as their opponent in the last few days, which is a remarkable thing when you consider how big the country is.\nSo I haven't seen, or at least not taken a detailed look at the schedule that's being kept by Mr. Trump and Secretary Clinton. But, again, I think it is common in national elections for a handful of states at the end to ultimately swing the outcome. And so it makes sense that the candidates and their strongest surrogates would be spending most of their time in the days before an election in those states and in those communities.\nFrancesca.\nQ: Thank you. On this same topic, without giving too much away, is it possible that the President will have additional events beyond the ones that have been advised through Friday before the election?\nMR. EARNEST: It is possible, yes.\nQ: Okay, it is possible. No idea where they're at? Won't tell us?\nMR. EARNEST: Stay tuned.\nQ: Okay. I do have a few questions on this topic, because it sounds like it's possible that this might be our last briefing then before the election, if that's the case.\nMR. EARNEST: We're still working on the schedule. We'll keep you posted on that, too.\nQ: You've talked about this in a different context before, but heading into the election, the President said that he'll take it as a personal insult if black voters don't come out and support Hillary Clinton in this election. Will he take it as a personal insult generally if Donald Trump is elected, given the things that Donald Trump has said about him, some of them so very personal?\nMR. EARNEST: You know, Francesca, I'm asked a lot about sort of how personally the President takes his criticism. And when you've served in the national spotlight for as long as he has, you develop a pretty thick skin. And to the degree that the President takes this election personally, it's rooted in the personal investment he has made in the progress and success of this country.\nHe has poured his own blood, sweat and tears into an economic strategy that prevented the United States from tipping over into a second Great Depression and has led to the longest streak of consecutive job growth in American history. He has poured his heart into the idea that we should coordinate with other countries around the world to fight climate change, to strengthen the economy, to fight terrorism, and to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. You surely, those of you who covered it, know that he spent a lot of hours that he would probably have rather spent doing something else talking to members of Congress about how to get health care reform done.\nSo the outcome of this election is significant because you have one candidate who is promising to tear all those accomplishments down. The President is personally invested in those accomplishments. He's personally invested in the progress that our country has made. And to the extent that the President feels personally affected by this election, that's what it is.\nHe's not offended by the outrageous things that his critics say about him. He just wants to make sure that all the work that he's done over the last eight years to strengthen our economy and strengthen our national security, and make our country more fair, to fight climate change and to advance our interests around the world -- that that progress is something that is not torn down but actually something that we build on.\nAnd that's how the President has made a decision about who to support in this election, and it's why the President has been so vocal in support of the candidate that has endorsed.\nQ: For that reason, all the things that you just said, though -- if Donald Trump were elected, again, based on what you just said, that would be a rejection of some of those things that President Obama has done over the last eight years. Would he find that personally insulting to the work that he did and to his legacy?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the President would be deeply disappointed if his successor were to try to roll back and tear down the progress we've spent so much of the last eight years working to achieve. And that's why he's so invested in this election. And that's why you see him making such a forceful case on the stump in support of Secretary Clinton.\nQ: And finally, does he still think that Donald Trump won't win?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm sorry?\nQ: Does he still think that Donald Trump is not going to win?\nMR. EARNEST: The President continues to be optimistic about the trajectory of the race. The President also is going to be forceful in warning people against complacency. The election is, of course, far from over and Election Day is still seven or eight days away.\nJohn, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. Two brief questions. Does the President believe that the FBI should release a report on the email before the election, just get the matter out of the politics thicket?\nMR. EARNEST: As I mentioned earlier to Michelle, I'll neither defend, nor criticize Director Comey's decision to communicate to the public about the facts of this investigation. I'll do that because of the institutional role of the White House not to interfere with an ongoing FBI or DOJ investigation. I'll also do that because I don't have any independent knowledge of what led Director Comey to decide to release that information.\nSo he'll ultimately have to make that decision himself. There appear to be plenty of people who are willing to offer him advice about how to, or whether to do that, so he doesn't need any advice from me, and I don't think he's looking for it.\nQ: And just to follow up -- the President is campaigning very hard, and I've noticed of late he has been campaigning for House candidates. He issued a strong endorsement of Christina Bennett Hartman in Pennsylvania's 16th District, which has been in Republican hands for more than a century, since Thaddeus Stevens had it, and he campaigned for Colonel Applegate in California, with some strong words about the incumbent -- Mr. Issa. Does he really believe that the Democrats have a chance to win the House of Representatives given this stepped-up area? And does he have a list of Republicans he'd like to take out?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the President is enthusiastic about the chances that Democrats have in the upcoming election, and he is eager to use his widespread popularity across the country to benefit them. And that's why you've seen the President traveling all over the country. That's why you've seen the President taping television and radio advertisements. That's why you've seen the President taping robo-calls or sending emails, encouraging people to actively support Democratic candidates for the House of Representatives. And he's bullish about Democratic prospects in the upcoming election, including for the House of Representatives.\nThanks, everybody.\nQ: Josh, no word on your costume? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: You're looking at it. (Laughter.)\nEND 2:22 P.M. EDT", "timestamp": "2016-10-31", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}

{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "note": "Remarks as delivered.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119701", "text": "Hello, Kent State! And Happy Halloween everybody! It's great to be back in Ohio – even if, even if the World Series is making life very stressful for Cubs fans everywhere.\nI want to thank Bruce Blair for that introduction, and for his service to our nation. I think every American should hear your story over the next 8 days before they vote. I also want to thank everyone who was part of the pre-program. In particular, let me thank Senator Sherrod Brown, such a great senator, my dear friend and great congressman Tim Ryan, State Representative John Boccieri, State Representative Kathleen Clyde, and let me thank the Kent Clarks, the acapella group that sang during the pre-program!\nMy friends, we are about to enter the final week of this election, so I wanted to come back to Ohio, one of the most competitive and consequential battlegrounds in the country, to talk about what's at stake in this election. But let me start with this. I'm sure a lot of you may be asking what this new email story is about and why in the world the FBI would decide to jump into an election with no evidence of any wrongdoing with just days to go. That's a good question!\nAnd first of all, for those of you who are concerned about my using personal email, I understand and as I've said, I'm not making excuses. I said it was a mistake and I regret it and now they apparently want to look at emails of one of my staffers and by all means, they should look at them. And I am sure they will reach the same conclusion they did when they looked at my emails for the last year. There is no case here. And they said it wasn't even a close call and I think most people have decided a long time ago what they think about all of this.\nNow what people are focused on is choosing the next President and Commander-in-Chief of the United States of America. And did any of you see the debates? Well, I think it was important because I had a chance to talk about my 30 years of public service and my plans for our country. And then people could weigh that against what my opponent has done and said. I am running against a man who says he doesn't understand why we can't use nuclear weapons. He actually said, 'Then why are we making them?' And he wants more countries to have nuclear weapons. Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia. Imagine nuclear weapons smack in the middle of the Middle East.\nAnd if you're telling yourself he'll surround himself with smart people who'll stop these crazy ideas, remember this: When he asked who he consults on foreign policy, Donald Trump said he didn't need to consult because he said and I quote, 'I have a very good brain.' He said he knows more about ISIS than our generals do. No, he does not. And of course, the people Donald Trump has had around him include two men whose activities are reportedly being investigated for their ties to Russia -- Vladimir Putin and Putin's allies.\nSo, in these last days, let's not get distracted from the real choice in this election and the consequences for your future. I started saying last June, I believe, that Donald Trump has proven himself temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be President and Commander-in-Chief. And I've got to tell you, I did not take any pleasure in saying that. I have known, I have known for years now people who ran for President, Republicans and Democrats. And I had my differences with Republicans and even with Democrats, but I never doubted their fitness to serve. Donald Trump is different. That's as serious as it gets.\nSo today, I want to talk about our national security. Because when the election is over and people wake up on November 9th, we will have picked the person who will carry the responsibility for all these weighty decisions. And that should really convince anyone how high the stakes really are in this election. And I just want to focus on three of the most crucial questions facing the next President: Can you be trusted to command our nuclear arsenal and make literally life and death decisions about war and peace? How do you handle a crisis? And do you know the difference between our allies and our adversaries?\nWe'll start with nuclear weapons. Now, I know there are some who will say that any discussion of this topic could be fear-mongering, but I don't think so and in part of what you just heard from Bruce Blair. When dozens of retired nuclear launch officers publicly state that Donald Trump should, and I quote, 'not have his finger on the button,' then this is a topic that can't be avoided. And as I've said, Donald has repeatedly suggested that more countries should have nuclear weapons. He must not realize or care that the more nuclear material there is in the world, the more likely terrorists are to get their hands on it -- or that someone will miscalculate and start a war that can't be stopped. And when a few more countries go nuclear, their neighbors will feel pressure to do so as well.\nOne of the reasons I worked so hard to impose sanctions on Iran so that we could get them to the negotiating table was so we would not have a nuclear arms race in the Middle East and I am proud that we put a lid on Iran's nuclear weapons program. But even the prospect of an actual nuclear war doesn't seem to bother Donald Trump. 'Good luck, enjoy yourselves, folks,' was what he had to say about a potential nuclear conflict in Asia.\nI wonder if he knows that a single nuclear warhead can kill millions of people. These are weapons today far more powerful than the bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II.\nTo talk so casually, so cavalierly about mass annihilation is truly appalling. President Ronald Reagan once said -- and he worked hard for arms control and I admired what he did working with the Soviet Union -- and he once said he feared, and this is a quote from President Reagan, 'some fool or some maniac or some accident triggering the kind of war that is the end of the line for all of us.' That has been the fear and the commitment of Democratic and Republican presidents since the dawn of the Atomic Age.\nSo what would he think about Donald Trump, who says he wants to be, and I quote, 'unpredictable' about using the most powerful weapons ever produced? And here's the thing with nuclear weapons – as Bruce told you, when the President gives the order, that's it. There's no veto for Congress, no veto by the Joint Chiefs. The officers in the silos have no choice but to fire. And that can take as little as four minutes. That's why all those retired launch officers stepped forward and said Donald Trump should never be put in charge of our nuclear arsenal.\nEarlier you heard from one of them, Bruce Blair, and his story is worth remembering. In 1973, Bruce was a young military officer working in an underground bunker in Montana. His job was to launch as many as 50 nuclear weapons if the President ever gave the order. Then one night in October, as the United States and the Soviet Union squared off over an escalating conflict in the Middle East, the emergency message he had trained for arrived: prepare for nuclear war. Like other American officers in bunkers and submarines and bombers around the world, Bruce and his colleagues started the process because that was their duty. They unlocked the safe, took out the launch codes and the keys, and then strapped into their chairs to brace for the shockwaves that would come if a Russian warhead detonated above them. Then they waited for the final order from the President. Thankfully, it never came. But when Bruce looks at Donald Trump, and sees his hair-trigger temper, and he thinks about what it felt like inside that bunker that night. As I've said many times, a man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.\nAnd that brings me to the second question I think voters should pose to both candidates: How do you handle a crisis? We've seen in this campaign that Donald Trump loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When he's gotten a tough question from a reporter. When he's challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. When he's confronted with his own words. So imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. Imagine his advisors afraid to tell him what he doesn't want to hear, racing against his legendarily short attention span to lay out life-and-death choices too complex to be reduced to a single tweet. And then imagine him plunging us into a war because somebody got under his very thin skin.\nNow thankfully, he's never been in a position where he had to help make life-and-death decisions for our country. But there was one national crisis where we did get a good look at how Donald Trump handles himself. Donald is a New Yorker, and his finest moment in this campaign was when he defended New York against Ted Cruz's attacks in a debate. And then he invoked the days after 9/11, when New Yorkers really came together and took care of each other. And I couldn't agree more. That's why it was so upsetting to learn what Donald was actually doing on 9/11. After the world watched with horror as the Twin Towers fell, he called in to a New York TV station. And even on that horrible day, when thousands of people lost their lives, he couldn't stop himself from pointing out that now, because the towers had fallen, a building he owned was now the tallest in Lower Manhattan. What kind of a person brags at a moment like that? I'll tell you: someone who should never set foot in the Oval Office and serve as Commander in Chief.\nFor me, I take this very personally, my friends. Because I was one of New York's senators along with Chuck Schumer on 9/11. He and I were on the ground the very next day, meeting with the Governor, the Mayor, emergency officials. And I will never forget the sight of Ground Zero. The thick smoke made it hard to breathe or see. Some of the firefighters and other first responders we met had been on duty nonstop since the planes hit the towers. They had all lost friends. In a makeshift command center, we were briefed on the damage, and it was clear we were going to need a lot of help to recover New York, and we were going to have to really make it our absolute mission to not only rebuild New York but to keep America safe.\nThat's what I did for eight years as a senator. I never stopped fighting to keep our country safer and to ensure that first responders got the medical care they needed. And I think it's important to reflect on what each of us has done in moments like that. Because a lot of the crises that come at a president are not predicted. They happen. I'll tell you a quick story. It was after President-elect Obama asked me to be secretary of state but before the inauguration. And I got a call to come to an emergency meeting in the White House in the Situation Room. And the new Obama national security team was on one side of table, and the outgoing Bush national security team was on the other side. And the Bush Administration had gotten credible intelligence that there was going to be an attack at our inauguration.\nSo even before we were sworn in to do our jobs, we were faced with helping to make such a consequential decision. It really matters what your experience has, what your values are, whether you can be counted on to make that decision. You learn a lot about people in moments like that. And as I sat there with the pressure on, having to think through in my own head, how we evaluated this intelligence, how we did everything we could to preserve our inauguration of our first African American president on the Mall in Washington.\nWe made the decision to go forward, obviously. Some of you might have been there. But we also did everything we could to double our efforts to find out about the intelligence and to secure the hundreds of thousands of people who would be there. So you have to ask yourself: in a crisis, who would you trust? Who will listen to good advice, keep a level head and make the right call? Because that's the person you want as our president and Commander in Chief.\nNow let's get to the third question for all of the voters to consider about each of us. Do you know the difference between our allies and our adversaries? Now this may seem like an easy question. If you got it on an exam, I think you'd be able to answer it. But apparently it's hard for Donald. He has picked fights with our friends. I mean the President of Mexico, the British prime minister, the German chancellor, pretty much the entire nation of Japan… and he even picked a fight with the Pope. And at the same time he is praising tyrants and dictators like Saddam Hussein and Kim Jong Un in North Korea and Bashar al-Assad for their supposed strong leadership. He even praised the Chinese government for massacring protesters in Tiananmen Square. Trump has repeatedly suggested he would abandon our allies in Europe and Asia.\nHe has called NATO, quote, 'obsolete.' Obsolete? NATO is the greatest military alliance in the history of the world. And it's based on something called Article V, which says, 'An attack on one is an attack on all.' And Article V has only been invoked one time: when our allies came to our defense after 9/11. We still have NATO allies fighting side by side, working side by side with American troops in Afghanistan. They joined us in going after Al Qaeda and Bin Laden. Now we're supposed to tell them we won't have their back?\nAnd by the way—right now, our NATO allies are helping identify and track terrorists who threaten America and Europe. They're hosting radar and missile defense installations that protect us against potential threats from Iran and elsewhere. And as our NATO forces in Afghanistan stand shoulder-to-shoulder with American troops, they share the risks and burdens. Now they're moving into the Baltic States to deter Russian aggression.\nTreating our allies like the small businesses and contractors that Trump exploited and stiffed in Atlantic City – hanging them out to dry -- would make our country and our world less safe. And it would play right into the hands of Russia and China, which are envious of our alliances and eager to see them weaken or fail. But maybe that's the point. Because what's most striking about all of this -- and I would argue most important for voters to consider – is the relationship between Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nAs former Secretary Madeleine Albright put it, and I quote her, 'We have never seen a mind meld of the kind between the Russian leadership and a candidate for the presidency of the United States.' Michael Morell, who ran the CIA and grew up just a few miles from here, has said that Putin is manipulating Donald. Putin is a trained intelligence officer from the old KGB. He knows he can use flattery to get into Donald's head -- to make Donald the Kremlin's puppet. And It seems to be working.\nDonald has signaled to Putin that he will let Russia do whatever it wants, from Ukraine to Syria and beyond. He's even said Putin is a stronger leader than President Obama. And it gets worse. The U.S. intelligence community has now confirmed that the Russian government, which means Putin, is directing cyber-attacks against targets in the United States to influence the outcome of our election.\nSo ask yourself, why would Putin be trying to get Donald Trump elected President? Could it be because of all of the nice things Donald has said about him, or the fact that he's promised to adopt pro-Kremlin policies, or maybe because of his extensive business dealings with Russian oligarchs with ties to Putin? Since Donald still won't release his tax returns, and don't hold your breath, we don't know the full extent of his business relationships --but what we do know is disturbing.\nAnd we know this: We are dealing with something unprecedented in the history of our country. A foreign adversary trying to influence our presidential election. That should scare everyone, Democrat, Republican, and Independent. With the election just eight days away, this can't wait any longer. Donald Trump should immediately disclose all of his ties and connections to the Kremlin and its associates. The American people deserve to know the full extent of these links and how they relate to what the Russians are doing in our election.\nWhen you step back and take it all in, it's no surprise that 50 Republican national security experts wrote an open letter saying that they will not vote for Donald Trump, because he would be – in their words – 'the most reckless President in American history.' It's no surprise that not a single former President, Secretary of State or Defense, or National Security Advisor from either party has endorsed him. It's no surprise that Bob Gates, who served eight presidents over 50 years, Democrats and Republicans alike, has said Trump is, and I quote, 'beyond repair… stubbornly uninformed about the world and how to lead our country and government… temperamentally unsuited to lead our men and women in uniform… unqualified and unfit to be commander-in-chief.'\nI hope you and voters across Ohio and America will think about all of these national security issues when you cast your vote in this election. Think about what it takes to lead -- and how we want to secure the safety of our country, our children and our grandchildren. And who is best to do that. So make no mistake, that really is what is on the ballot this year. It's not just my name and Donald Trump's name. It's our future. Our security. Our values. It's who we are as a country.\nDonald Trump has a dark and divisive vision for America that could tear our country apart. But the good news is: There's another vision for America. Instead of dark and divisive, it's hopeful and inclusive and optimistic and unified. And it is big-hearted, not small-minded. It's about lifting people up, not tearing each other down. It's a vision that says, as I believe in my heart that we are stronger together.\nMillions of people across our country are standing up and saying: We believe in an America that is great because it is good. That is Democrats, Republicans and Independents. Because we believe in an America where women are respected. An America where veterans are honored, parents are supported, and workers are paid fairly … an America where marriage is a right and discrimination is wrong…. an America that leads in the world and lives up to our values… where everyone counts and everyone has a place. Where the American dream is big enough for everyone.\nThis goes way beyond policies and partisanship. We're talking about what it really means to be an American in the 21st century. About the basic lessons we want to teach boys and girls, kids and grandkids. It turns out, if you dig deep enough, through all the mud of politics, eventually you hit something hard and true. A foundation of fundamental values that unite us as Americans – basic beliefs about equality and opportunity and freedom and common decency.\nThat's something to defend – and to build on. And, in the end, that's what this election is all about. Here in Ohio, you can make the difference. Early voting has already begun. So now is the time. Every phone call you make, every door you knock, moves us forward. You can go to hillaryclinton.com, and sign up to volunteer. Or text J-O-I-N to 4-7-2-4-6 to do the same.\nSometimes -- if you have studied history -- you know the fate of the greatest nations comes down to single moments in time. This is one of those make-or-break moments for the United States. And it truly is in your hands, as it should be. When your kids and grandkids ask you what you did in 2016, when everything was on the line, I hope you will be able to say: I voted for a better, stronger, fairer America. A place where our future will be created and charted by people will have confidence that that the best days of America are still ahead of us. Particularly young people who I believe absolutely should help make that future!\nSo let's come together, let us make clear that we are going to stand up for an America that we believe in because that America believes in us. And we are going to prove once and for all that love trumps hate. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2016-10-31", "title": "Remarks at the Kent State Student Recreation Center in Kent, Ohio"}

When we win on November 8th, I am going to bring back your jobs. The long nightmare of jobs leaving Michigan will be coming to an end. We will make Michigan the economic envy of the world once again.\nThe political class in Washington has betrayed you. They've uprooted your jobs, and your communities, and shipped your wealth all over the world. They put new skyscrapers up in Beijing while your factories in Michigan crumbled.\nI will end the theft of American prosperity. I will fight for every last Michigan job.\nBecause, when we win, it's going to be America First.\nSo you have to make sure you get in your absentee ballots, and to get to the polls on November 8th. You have to vote. Vote with all of your heart and soul. Show the whole world how much you love Michigan, and how much you love America, by voting to take back the jobs that have been stolen from you. I'm asking for the vote of Republicans, Democrats, Independents and First-Time voters who want great jobs, safe neighborhoods, and a government that works for the people.\nI'm asking you to believe in America once again.\nBut to bring back your jobs, we must also immediately repeal and replace Obamacare.\nIt's just been announced that Michigan residents are going to experience crushing double-digit premium hikes.\nIn Minnesota, where the premium increase will be close to 60 percent, the Democratic Governor has said \"the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable.\"\nHillary Clinton wants to double-down on Obamacare, making it even more expensive – in fact, much more expensive. I'm asking for your vote so we can replace Obamacare and save healthcare for every family in Michigan.\nReal change also means restoring honesty to our government.\nAs you know, the FBI has reopened its investigation into Hillary Clinton and has discovered another 650,000 emails. Hillary lied under oath when she said she turned over all of her work-related emails – just one more lie out of so many.\nThis is the biggest scandal since Watergate. Hillary wants to blame everyone else for her mounting legal troubles, but she has brought this all onto herself. Hillary is the one who set-up an illegal private email server in a closet to shield her criminal activity.\nHillary is the one who engaged in a corrupt Pay-For-Play scheme at the State Department – and now there are 5 FBI probes into the Clinton Foundation and their pay-for-play activities. Hillary is the one who sent and received classified information on an insecure server, putting the safety of the American people under threat.\nHillary is the one who lied to Congress under oath. Hillary is the one who lied to the FBI. Hillary is the one who made 13 phones disappear. Hillary is the one who destroyed 33,000 emails. Hillary is the one who broke the law over and over and over again. We can be sure that what is in those emails is absolutely devastating.\nHillary is not the victim – the American people are the victims of this corrupt system in every way, and this is your one chance to change it.\nHillary is likely to be under investigation for a very long time. One of her longtime supporters, a top Democratic Pollster, Doug Schoen, is now totally withdrawing his support. He wrote an article entitled \"I'm a Democrat, I worked for Bill Clinton, but I can't vote for Hillary.\"\nSchoen writes: \"I am now convinced that we will be facing the very real possibility of a constitutional crisis with many dimensions and deleterious consequences should Secretary Clinton win the election.\"\nSchoen warns that if Hillary is elected, she would be under protracted criminal investigation – and probably a trial of a sitting President.\nThe investigation will last for years, a trial will probably start, nothing will get done, and our country will continue to suffer.\nShe is unfit and unqualified to be President, and her election would mire our government and our country in a constitutional crisis we cannot afford. We need to be going to work for the American people – we can't do that with Hillary in the White House trying to avoid prosecution.\nHillary Clinton's corruption is a threat to Democracy, and the only way to save our Democracy is get out and vote by the millions.\nThe Clinton crime spree ends on November 8th. And when we close the chapter on the Clintons, we open a bright new chapter focused on the American People.\nMy Contract with The American Voter begins with a plan to restore honesty and accountability to our government.\nI want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words we are all about to say. When we win on November 8th, We Are Going To Washington, D.C. And We Are Going to drain the swamp.\nAt the core of my contract is my plan to bring back your jobs.\nMichigan has lost more than 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA, a deal strongly supported by Hillary Clinton.\nBefore NAFTA went into effect, there were 280,000 auto workers in Michigan. Today, that number is only 160,000. Our country has lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization – another Bill and Hillary-backed deal.\nWe have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit with the world. We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. Our trade deficit with China grew almost 40 percent during Hillary's tenure as Secretary of State. Her trade deal with South Korea killed another 100,000 America jobs.\nSo when you look around Michigan, and you see the rusted-out factories, the empty buildings, and the long unemployment lines, remember: Hillary Clinton did much of this to you.\nHillary got rich selling your jobs – the same special interests who pushed the jobs out of America are the people who've given countless millions to the Clintons. Hillary gets rich making America poor.\nJust look at the devastation. Delphi laid off 3,627 workers here in Michigan. Most of those jobs went to Mexico. We are going to fight for the workers at Delphi. They got a raw deal, and they deserve better.\nGM laid off 314 workers at the Lake Orion Assembly Plant in 2013 because of imports from the South Korean trade deal pushed through by Hillary Clinton.\nLear Corporation laid off another 50 people in Rochester Hills and moved their jobs to South Korea.\nFTE Automotive laid off 166 people in Auburn Hills. Their jobs went to Mexico.\nChrysler laid off over 5,300 workers. Those jobs went to Mexico, China, India and other countries.\nFord laid off 2,155 workers. Those jobs went to other countries.\nNow, Ford is moving all if its small car production to Mexico.\nA Trump Administration will stop the flight of American jobs.\nIf Ford, or another company, announces they want to move their jobs to Mexico or another country, then I will pick up the phone – I will call the executives – and I will tell them that if they want do that, we will charge a 35% tax when they try to ship their products back across the border.\nIt used to be the cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Now, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint.\nWe are going to turn it all around. We are going to rebuild Flint. We are going to rebuild Detroit. And we are going to rebuild Michigan.\nI'd like to share a special message today with the African-American community in Michigan which has been so terribly harmed by the policies of the Clintons.\nLook at the City of Detroit. It used to be the manufacturing hub of the world – now, nearly half of Detroit residents do not work, it has the second-highest violent crime rate in the country, and the children are trapped in failing government schools.\nYet, as the people of Detroit suffer, Hillary wants to spend trillions of dollars on government benefits for illegal immigrants and refugees.\nI've outlined a plan for urban renewal, it's called A New Deal For Black America. That deal includes a plan to use the money we will save by securing our border, and curbing refugee admissions, to invest in communities like Flint and Detroit.\nIt includes a pledge of school choice for African-American children.\nMy plan also includes a promise to cancel billions in climate change spending for the United Nations – a number Hillary wants to increase – and instead use that money to provide for American infrastructure, including clean water in cities like Flint.\nMy plan also includes a pledge to reduce violent crime – every child in this nation has a right to grow up in safety and peace. And my plan includes a pledge to restore manufacturing in the United States.\nHillary and the Democratic Party have run the inner cities for years, and only produced more poverty. The time has come for real change – I'm asking you for the honor of your vote so that together we can turn decades of political failure into generations of lasting success.\nHillary, on the other hand, wants to destroy what's left of manufacturing in Michigan with the Trans-Pacific Partnership. A Trump Administration will stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nWe will renegotiate NAFTA and, if we don't get the deal we want, we will terminate NAFTA and get a much better deal. We are going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent. We are going to massively cut taxes for the Middle Class.\nWe will unleash American energy – including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal. The Obama-Clinton war on coal is going to cost this state 50,000 jobs.\nWe will also work to restore and protect the Great Lakes. We are going to become a rich country again. But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.\nHillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian Refugees. Hillary's immigration plans mean generations of terrorism, extremism and radicalism spreading into your schools and communities here in Michigan.\nWhen we win, we will suspend the Syrian Refugee Program – and we will keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.\nA Trump Administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. And yes, we will build a wall.\nWe've received the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers. They tell us the border crisis is the worst it's ever been – it's a national emergency. They also warn America that Hillary's plan is the \"the most radical proposal in U.S. history.\"\nWhen I become President, we will end illegal immigration, deport all criminal aliens, and put American Workers First.\nWe will also repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military.\nWe also need a new foreign policy that puts America First.\nHillary led us to disaster in Iraq, Syria and Libya. Then, after Benghazi, she looked the families of the fallen in the eye and lied – she blamed it all on a video.\nHillary and our failed Washington Establishment have spent $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East, and now it's in worse shape than ever before. Imagine if some of that money had been spent building new schools, roads and bridges right here in Michigan.\nNow, Hillary – trapped in her Washington bubble that is blind to the lessons of the past – wants to start a shooting war in Syria in conflict with a nuclear-armed Russia, that could drag us into World War III.\nThe arrogant political class never learns. They keep repeating the same mistakes, they keep telling the same lies, they keep producing the same failed results.\nHow can Hillary manage this country when she can't even manage her email server? It's just one disaster after another, one scandal after another, one betrayal after another.\nTo all Americans I say: it is time for new leadership.\nJust think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days –\nWe are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; cancel every illegal Obama executive order; rebuild our military and take care of our Vets; support the men and women of law enforcement; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\nHillary wants us to think small, wants us to believe things can't change, and wants our lives to revolve around Washington, D.C. I am asking you to dream big, to push for bold change, and to believe in a movement powered by the people and by their love for this country.\nI'm tired of politicians telling Americans to defer their dreams to another day – when they really mean another decade.\nAmerica is tired of waiting. The moment is now.\nAll we have to do is stop believing in our failed politicians and start believing in each other and in our country.\nThere is no challenge too great, no dream outside of our reach. Don't let anyone tell you it can't be done — the future lies with the dreamers, not the cynics and the critics.\nHillary has been there for 30 years, and she has accomplished nothing – she's just made things worse. She is the candidate of yesterday. We are the movement of the future.\nOur movement represents all Americans, from all backgrounds, and all walks of life. We are asking for the votes of Republicans, Democrats, Independents, and first-time voters.\nWe are asking for the vote of every American who believes truth and justice – not money and power – should rule the day.\nWe are fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people – not the donors and special interests.\nWe are fighting to unlock the potential of every American community, and every American family, who hope and pray and yearn for a better future.\nWith your vote, we are just 8 days away from the change you've been waiting for your entire life.\nTogether, We Will Make America Wealthy Again.\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.", "timestamp": "2016-10-31", "title": "Remarks at Macomb Community College South Campus in Warren, Michigan"}

Federal leaders have responded to input from governors, mayors, county officials, Tribal leaders, and other stakeholders to advance climate resilience. In addition, the Administration has taken action to integrate climate-risk considerations into Federal operations, improve access to climate data, information, and tools, and invest in building more climate-resilient communities.\nClimate variability and change impact key economic sectors and the livelihoods of citizens. In the last decade, the Federal Government incurred direct costs of over $357 billion due to extreme weather and wildfires and the financial risks of climate change will continue to grow significantly in the coming decades. Instead of waiting to respond, the Federal Government is committed to working with communities to anticipate and reduce the future damages of climate change.\nToday's \"Resilience Opportunities\" report builds on lessons learned and outlines three major areas where opportunities exist for innovation, economic growth, and collaboration: through application of science-based data and tools, support for community resilience initiatives, and integration of climate resilience into Federal agency missions, operations, and culture. The full report, \"Opportunities to Enhance the Nation's Resilience to Climate Change,\" can be found  here.\nOne of the opportunities identified in the report is working with stakeholders to enhance the usability of climate information. Today, the White House Office of Science & Technology Policy is  announcing the launch of a public-private collaboration designed to address this need. A diverse set of private, governmental, academic, and nonprofit collaborators today are launching the beta version of the Resilience Dialogues, an online, consultative service to support communities in their resilience planning. The Resilience Dialogues collaboration enables community leaders to engage in facilitated, expedited, and tailored discussion with scientists, practitioners, and other subject-matter experts. The Resilience Dialogues service will also help communities identify their climate risks and navigate information that will empower them to better prepare and adapt. This public-private collaboration will be coordinated by the U.S. Global Change Research Program and the American Geophysical Union's Thriving Earth Exchange with support from the Kresge Foundation. A full list of organizations participating in this collaboration can be found  here.\nToday's report also identifies the opportunity to encourage comprehensive preparedness, including by increasing resilient design and construction. In support of this goal, today the Administration is announcing a coalition of 97  colleges, universities, associations, and academic centers around the country that are committing to ensure that the next generation of design professionals are prepared to design and build for extreme weather events and the impacts of climate change. This commitment builds on the leadership of many educators around the country who have already begun incorporating resilience and climate preparedness into their respective programs. In addition to these commitments, Federal departments and agencies are announcing new actions to support educational efforts on resilient design, including new research on interdisciplinary approaches to educating on resilient design and new resources to increase awareness of how resilience can be applied in design and construction.", "timestamp": "2016-10-31", "title": "Fact Sheet: Obama Administration Highlights Opportunities for Building Community Climate Resilience across the Nation"}

The assets, networks, and systems that enable us to innovate and prosper are necessary for sustaining and supporting the well-being of our Nation, and our increasing dependence on them makes securing and protecting them a top priority. This month, we recognize the importance of our critical infrastructure and resolve to safeguard these vital systems so they remain strong and resilient.\nOur critical infrastructure spans a wide array of structures and systems we rely on to meet our day-to-day needs. It includes government facilities, the electric grid, transportation and water systems, information technology, and financial systems—all which play an equally important role in maintaining our way of life. These complex systems work together to keep us safe and healthy, and although they are among the most advanced and secure in the world, we must remain vigilant and ensure their resilience by mitigating the threats and stresses that can weaken them.\nSecuring our complex critical infrastructure systems requires cooperation and sustained commitment from everyone, which is why my Administration is working with businesses, infrastructure owners, and officials at all levels of government to protect them. We must take necessary steps to modernize our roads, bridges, pipes, and ports to ensure they remain resilient and strong—especially as climate change becomes an increasing risk, causing more extreme weather events that threaten our infrastructure. In addition to physical threats and hazards, cybersecurity risks pose another significant challenge to our Nation. We must ensure that addressing threats to the security of our data and our digital networks remains a priority. By partnering with the private sector, and with the help of the American people, we can prepare our critical infrastructure to withstand and respond to cyber threats, terrorist attacks, acts of nature including space weather events, and other threats and hazards.\nThree years ago, I issued a Presidential Policy Directive to strengthen and maintain secure and resilient critical infrastructure. Today, we are continuing to carry out this vision for how Government and the private sector can work together to reduce risks and increase the stability and security of our infrastructure. And because our world has never been more interconnected, we know that keeping our critical infrastructure functioning will require collaboration with international partners. That is why we are working to promote global critical infrastructure security and resilience through information sharing with partners around the world.\nAs our population grows and our technology advances, the demands of our critical infrastructure become increasingly significant. During Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month, we recommit to reducing risks to these important systems and preparing to adapt and respond to any incident that may occur. To ensure more Americans can thrive in a future of greater safety, stability, and prosperity, we must protect and enhance these essential elements of our cyber and physical infrastructure for generations to come.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2016 as Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month. I call upon the people of the United States to recognize the importance of protecting our Nation's infrastructure and to observe this month with appropriate events and training to enhance our national security and resilience.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-10-31", "title": "Proclamation 9533—Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month, 2016"}

Too often, those suffering from Alzheimer's cannot recognize their loved ones or remember how to perform daily tasks, struggling physically and mentally with things that once came naturally. Although we have long known Alzheimer's to be irreversible and fatal, we maintain hope that by advancing research and treatment options we can work to change these outcomes and ensure brighter prospects for all those who face this disease. During National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month, we resolve to continue working toward this brighter future as we stand with every person battling, Alzheimer's and their loved ones.\nAlzheimer's disease is more likely to affect Americans as they grow older—although genetics can also play a role, age is the most significant risk factor. But Alzheimer's touches many more individuals than simply those who are diagnosed. Dedicated caregivers—whether professionals, family members, or friends—are also emotionally, physically, and financially affected by Alzheimer's disease, giving of themselves to ensure those who face it are not alone. And because these individuals need access to information and resources in order to provide this essential care, we launched www.Alzheimers.gov to give them a place to find help.\nThrough the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, my Administration has been working to meet a goal of being able to prevent and effectively treat this illness by 2025. Over the past year we have taken a number of actions to reach this vision, including developing a training curriculum that gives health care workers the necessary skills to care for dementia patients and better detect and diagnose dementia. We have also helped family caregivers look after their own health, in addition to addressing the needs of people with dementia, and launched a campaign to increase awareness of changes in the brain as people age so that older adults feel more comfortable having open conversations with family members and health care providers.\nIn addition to ensuring anyone with Alzheimer's can access proper care, we must harness the innovative ideas of the scientific community and work to prevent this disease. To ramp up research and development aimed at uncovering the answers to diseases like Alzheimer's, I have increased funding for research dedicated to understanding, preventing, and curing Alzheimer's and related dementias. I also introduced the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies Initiative, which will enhance our understanding of brain function and give scientists the tools they need to better understand and discover new ways to treat, cure, and prevent brain disorders. And through a bold new research effort that seeks to deliver personalized care through patient-centered research and collaboration, my Precision Medicine Initiative is working to revolutionize our understanding of diseases like Alzheimer's.\nFrom researchers and advocates who are bringing us closer to preventing this disease to family members who devotedly look after their loved ones, people across our country are doing their part to support those touched by Alzheimer's. This month, let us honor those we have lost too soon and renew our efforts to ensure more Americans can live their lives with health and happiness.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2016 as National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month. I call upon the people of the United States to learn more about Alzheimer's disease and support the individuals living with this disease and their caregivers.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-10-31", "title": "Proclamation 9534—National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month, 2016"}

During National Entrepreneurship Month, we celebrate the entrepreneurs who serve their communities and bolster our economy, and we pledge our support for them in their pursuit of the ideas and innovations of tomorrow.\nThrough their intrepid sense of possibility and resilience, and their unwillingness to give in or give up, entrepreneurs from every walk of life make invaluable contributions to the American experience—turning bold ideas into real progress. My Administration has made it a priority from day one to support those who take a risk and put in the hard work required to get a new venture off the ground. In 2010, I signed the Affordable Care Act, which gives Americans greater opportunities to start businesses by offering portable and affordable health insurance plans through the Health Insurance Marketplace. I signed 18 tax breaks for small businesses in my first term, including tax credits for those who hire unemployed workers and veterans, and I launched the Nation of Makers initiative to advance innovation and encourage making, including homegrown technologies and startups. In 2013, I signed an Executive Order to make Government data more accessible to the public, and my Administration has opened up nearly 200,000 datasets on www.Data.gov to fuel economic growth, innovation, and entrepreneurship. And earlier this year, I announced the Computer Science for All Initiative—a plan to give all students in America the chance to learn computer science in school, which will equip our future entrepreneurs, including those from underrepresented backgrounds, with the computational thinking skills they need to succeed.\nIn the 21st-century economy—where business does not stop at a country's border and where technological advancements have changed the ways we engage in commerce and with one another—it is more important than ever that we give our Nation's entrepreneurs the tools and resources they need to compete on the international stage. This past summer, I signed an Executive Order that encourages entrepreneurship in the United States and around the world, including through the Presidential Ambassadors for Global Entrepreneurship Program, to promote the sharing of knowledge and experience with the entrepreneurs of tomorrow. Additionally, as I attended the Global Entrepreneurship Summit in California in June, companies across America came together to sign the Tech Inclusion Pledge: a commitment to making their technology workforces more representative of the American people. My Administration also used this Summit as an opportunity to announce an expansion of the National Science Foundation's Innovation Corps training program for entrepreneurial scientists and engineers, as well as the Small Business Administration's Startup in a Day initiative, with nearly 100 cities and communities across our Nation committed to streamlining licensing, permitting, and other requirements necessary for anyone to start a business. At the end of last year, I signed a bipartisan budget deal that made permanent critical tax incentives to help bolster investment in small businesses and research and experimentation, including by startups and other innovative companies. And thanks to another bipartisan bill I signed, entrepreneurs can raise small-dollar investments from community members, customers, and other individuals through new and regulated online crowdfunding platforms—because access to capital should be available to every aspiring entrepreneur no matter who they are or where they are from.\nMy Administration has also striven to expand opportunity to those seeking to utilize their entrepreneurial talents abroad. Following the beginning of our process to normalize relations with our neighbors 90 miles to the south in Cuba, we made it easier for Cuban entrepreneurs to import and export. Entrepreneurs flourish when they are surrounded by an environment that encourages their success—that is true here at home and around the world. My Administration remains committed to implementing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement that will have a profound effect on our efforts to support online entrepreneurs and enable American entrepreneurs to sell \"Made in America\" products all over the world. And through our proposed International Entrepreneur Rule, we are working to ensure the world's best and brightest entrepreneurs can launch companies and create jobs in the United States.\nAs we celebrate National Entrepreneurship Month and Global Entrepreneurship Week, let us resolve to support those budding entrepreneurs looking to use their ideas and expertise to build a better life for themselves and their families—and let us tap into the diverse skills and talents across our country so that entrepreneurs from all backgrounds can continue creating the businesses of the 21st century. Entrepreneurship is about the opportunity to forge one's own future, and an investment in that future can start as something small and turn into something great. That is the legacy shaped by generations of American entrepreneurs who, through ingenuity, passion, and self-determination, have always striven to achieve the next big, unknown thing.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2016 as National Entrepreneurship Month. I call upon all Americans to commemorate this month with appropriate programs and activities, and to celebrate November 15, 2016, as National Entrepreneurs' Day.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-10-31", "title": "Proclamation 9535—National Entrepreneurship Month, 2016"}

During National Family Caregivers Month, we reaffirm our support for those who give of themselves to be there for their family, friends, and neighbors in challenging times, and we pledge to carry forward the progress we have made in our health care system and workplaces to give caregivers the resources and flexibility they need.\nEach of us may find ourselves in need of or providing care at some point in our lives. That is why it is imperative that we maintain and expand the Affordable Care Act (ACA). At the time Medicare was created, only a little more than half of all seniors had some form of health insurance. Today, the ACA has given older Americans better care and more access to discounted prescriptions and certain preventive services at no cost. The ACA has also expanded options for home- and community-based services, so that, with the help of devoted, loving caregivers, more Americans are now able to live independently and with dignity. And because looking after an aging family member or a friend with a disability can be challenging, States and local agencies connect individuals with caregiver support groups and respite care. The women and men who put their loved ones before themselves show incredible generosity every day, and we must continue to support them in every task they selflessly carry out.\nMany devoted caregivers across our country also attend to members of our Armed Forces when they return home, and my Administration is committed to improving the care and support our veterans and their families receive. For over 5 years, First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden's Joining Forces initiative has worked to ensure those who look after our service members who come home with the wounds of war—whether they are visible or not—have the community and Government support they need to help their siblings and spouses, parents and children, neighbors and friends through one of the greatest battles they may face: the fight to recover and heal.\nThis month, and every month, let us lift up all those who work to tirelessly advance the health and wellness of those they love. Let us encourage those who choose to be caregivers and look toward a future where our politics and our policies reflect the selflessness and open-hearted empathy they show their loved ones every day.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 2016 as National Family Caregivers Month. I encourage all Americans to pay tribute to those who provide for the health and well-being of their family members, friends, and neighbors.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

Today, young American Indians and Alaska Natives embrace open-ended possibility and are determining their own destinies. During National Native American Heritage Month, we pledge to maintain the meaningful partnerships we have with tribal nations, and we renew our commitment to our nation-to-nation relationships as we seek to give all our children the future they deserve.\nOver our long shared history, there have been too many unfortunate chapters of pain and tragedy, discrimination and injustice. We must acknowledge that history while recognizing that the future is still ours to write. That is why my Administration remains dedicated to strengthening our government-to-government relationships with tribal nations and working to improve the lives of all our people. Three years ago, I issued an Executive Order establishing the White House Council on Native American Affairs to help ensure the Federal Government engages in true and lasting relationships with tribes and promotes the development of prosperous and resilient tribal communities. Last month, I hosted the eighth Tribal Nations Conference and brought tribal leaders together to identify key issues we still face. We have worked to better protect sacred lands and restored many acres of tribal homelands, as well as supported greater representation of indigenous peoples before the United Nations and called for further implementation of the Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. And we have taken steps to strengthen tribal sovereignty in criminal justice matters, including through the Tribal Law and Order Act.\nThrough the Affordable Care Act and permanent reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, we empowered more Native Americans to access the quality health care they need to live full, healthy lives. Throughout their lives, 84 percent of American Indian and Alaska Native women and girls will experience some form of violence, and in 2013, I signed the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which allows tribes to prosecute non-Native individuals who commit acts of domestic violence in Indian Country. And through the North American Working Group on Violence Against Indigenous Women and Girls, we are strengthening regional coordination on the rights of women and girls from indigenous communities across the continent.\nIn recognition of the immeasurable contributions that Native Americans have made to our Nation, we continue to advocate for expanding opportunity across Indian Country. We have supported tribal colleges and universities and worked to return control of education to tribal nations—not only to prepare Native youth for the demands of future employment, but also to promote their own tribal languages and cultures. We are investing in job training and clean-energy projects, infrastructure, and high-speed internet that connects Native American communities to the broader economy. We are connecting more young people and fostering a national dialogue to empower the next generation of Native leaders through the Generation Indigenous initiative. Through www.NativeOneStop.gov, we have also worked to improve coordination and access to Federal services throughout Indian Country. Indian Country still faces many challenges, but we have made significant progress together since I took office, and we must never give up on our pursuit of the ever brighter future that lies ahead.\nThis month, let us celebrate the traditions, languages, and stories of Native Americans and ensure their rich histories and contributions can thrive with each passing generation. Let us continue to build on the advancements we have made, because enduring progress will depend on our dedication to honoring our trust and treaty responsibilities.

On April 26, 2006, in Executive Order 13400, the President determined that the conflict in Sudan's Darfur region posed an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, expanded the scope of the national emergency to deal with that threat, and ordered the blocking of property of certain persons connected to the conflict. On October 13, 2006, the President issued Executive Order 13412 to take additional steps with respect to the national emergency and to implement the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-344).\nThe actions and policies of the Government of Sudan continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13067 of November 3, 1997, expanded on April 26, 2006, and with respect to which additional steps were taken on October 13, 2006, must continue in effect beyond November 3, 2016. Therefore, consistent with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency with respect to Sudan declared in Executive Order 13067.\nThis notice shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the Congress.\nBARACK OBAMA\nThe White House,\nOctober 31, 2016.", "timestamp": "2016-10-31", "title": "Notice—Continuation of the National Emergency With Respect to Sudan"}
