Trump's campaign claims the reporting is not true, yet they refuse to produce the only evidence that could prove the Times wrong: Trump's tax returns.\nIn response to the new report, Hillary for America deputy communications director Christina Reynolds issued the following statement:\n\"In the wake of a blockbuster report showing that even Trump's own lawyers thought the IRS would likely find the \"legally dubious\" scheme he used to avoid taxes was against the law, the Trump campaign still refuses to release his tax returns. While breaking a precedent running for 40 years, Trump has clung to the excuse that he is under audit, despite no proof that he is and no prohibition for releasing returns under audit. Given that Trump was required to file his 2015 taxes recently, he has no reason to withhold it since it is too soon for him to possibly be under audit for those year. There's no excuse left for Trump—if he's not still using these \"dubious\" schemes to avoid paying taxes, he needs to prove it with his most recent tax returns.\"\nTrump and his campaign continue to dodge disclosure of these critical documents that could shed light on important issues including his wealth, his questionable charitable giving, his foreign and domestic business entanglements, his personal tax rate and more. The Times' reporting raising important new questions that underscore the urgency in releasing the tax returns before Election Day.\nKey Point: \"As he scrambled to stave off financial ruin, Mr. Trump avoided reporting hundreds of millions of dollars in taxable income by using a tax avoidance maneuver so legally dubious his own lawyers advised him that the Internal Revenue Service would likely declare it improper if he were audited.\"\n* \"Tax experts who reviewed the newly obtained documents for The New York Times said Mr. Trump's tax avoidance maneuver, conjured from ambiguous provisions of highly technical tax court rulings, clearly pushed the edge of the envelope of what tax laws permitted at the time.'Whatever loophole existed was not 'exploited' here, but stretched beyond any recognition,' said Steven M. Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center who helped draft tax legislation in the early 1990s.\"\n* \"One letter, 25 pages long, analyzed seven distinct components of Mr. Trump's proposed tax maneuver.

Trump proudly acknowledges he did not pay a dime in federal income taxes for years on end. He insists he merely exploited tax loopholes legally available to any billionaire — loopholes he says Hillary Clinton failed to close during her years in the United States Senate. \"Why didn't she ever try to change those laws so I couldn't use them?\" Mr. Trump asked during a campaign rally last month.\nBut newly obtained documents show that in the early 1990s, as he scrambled to stave off financial ruin, Mr. Trump avoided reporting hundreds of millions of dollars in taxable income by using a tax avoidance maneuver so legally dubious his own lawyers advised him that the Internal Revenue Service would likely declare it improper if he were audited.\nThanks to this one maneuver — which was later outlawed by Congress — Mr. Trump potentially escaped paying tens of millions of dollars in federal personal income taxes. It is impossible to know for sure because Mr. Trump has declined to release his tax returns, or even a summary of his returns, breaking a practice followed by every Republican and Democratic presidential candidate for more than four decades.\nTax experts who reviewed the newly obtained documents for The New York Times said Mr. Trump's tax avoidance maneuver, conjured from ambiguous provisions of highly technical tax court rulings, clearly pushed the edge of the envelope of what tax laws permitted at the time. \"Whatever loophole existed was not 'exploited' here, but stretched beyond any recognition,\" said Steven M. Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center who helped draft tax legislation in the early 1990s.\nMoreover, the tax experts said the maneuver trampled a core tenet of American tax policy by conferring enormous tax benefits to Mr. Trump for losing vast amounts of other people's money — in this case, money investors and banks had entrusted to him to build a casino empire in Atlantic City.\nAs that empire floundered in the early 1990s, Mr. Trump pressured his financial backers to forgive hundreds of millions of dollars in debt he could not repay. While the cancellation of so much debt gave new life to Mr. Trump's casinos, it created a potentially crippling problem with the Internal Revenue Service. In the eyes of the I.R.S., a dollar of canceled debt is the same as a dollar of taxable income. This meant Mr. Trump faced the painful prospect of having to report the hundreds of millions of dollars of canceled debt as if it were hundreds of millions of dollars of taxable income.\nBut Mr. Trump's audacious tax-avoidance maneuver gave him a way to simply avoid reporting any of that canceled debt to the I.R.S. \"He's getting something for absolutely nothing,\" John L. Buckley, who served as the chief of staff for Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation in 1993 and 1994, said in an interview\nThe new documents, which include correspondence from Mr. Trump's tax lawyers and bond offering disclosure statements, might also help explain how Mr. Trump reported a staggering loss of $916 million in his 1995 tax returns — portions of which were first published by The Times last month.\nUnited States tax laws allowed Mr. Trump to use that $916 million loss to cancel out an equivalent amount of taxable income. But tax experts have been debating how Mr. Trump could have legally declared a deduction of that magnitude at all. Among other things, they have noted that Mr. Trump's huge casino losses should have been offset by the hundreds of millions of dollars in taxable income he surely must have reported to the I.R.S. in the form of canceled casino debt.\nBy avoiding reporting his canceled casino debt in the first place, however, Mr. Trump's $916 million deduction would not have been reduced by hundreds of millions of dollars. He could have preserved the deduction and used it instead to avoid paying income taxes he might otherwise have owed on books, TV shows or branding deals. Under the rules in effect in 1995, the $916 million loss could have been used to wipe out more than $50 million a year in taxable income for 18 years.\nMr. Trump declined to comment for this article.\n\"Your e-mail suggests either a fundamental misunderstanding or an intentional misreading of the law,\" Hope Hicks, Mr. Trump's spokeswoman, said in a statement. \"Your thesis is a criticism, not just of Mr. Trump, but of all taxpayers who take the time and spend the money to try to comply with the dizzyingly complex and ambiguous tax laws without paying more tax than they owe. Mr. Trump does not think that taxpayers should file returns that resolve all doubt in favor of the I.R.S. And any tax experts that you have consulted are engaged in pure speculation. There is no news here.\"\nMr. Trump financed his three Atlantic City gambling resorts with $1.3 billion in debt, most of it in the form of high interest junk bonds. By late 1990, after months of escalating operating losses, New Jersey casino regulators were warning that \"a complete financial collapse of the Trump Organization was not out of the question.\" By 1992, all three casinos had filed for bankruptcy and bondholders were ultimately forced to forgive hundreds of millions of dollars in debt to salvage at least part of their investment.\nThe story of how Mr. Trump sidestepped a potentially ruinous tax bill from that forgiven debt emerged from documents recently discovered by The Times during a search of the casino bankruptcy filings. The documents offer only a partial description of events, and none of Mr. Trump's tax lawyers agreed to be interviewed for this article.\nAt the time, Mr. Trump would have been hard-pressed to pay tens of millions of dollars in taxes. According to assessments of his financial stability by New Jersey casino regulators, there were times in the early 1990s when Mr. Trump had no more than a few million dollars in his various bank accounts. He was so strapped for cash that his creditors were apoplectic when they learned that Mr. Trump had bought Marla Maples an engagement ring estimated to be worth $250,000.\nIt is unclear who first glimpsed a way for Mr. Trump to dodge a huge tax bill. But the basic maneuver he used was essentially a new twist on a contentious strategy corporations had been using for years to avoid taxes created by canceled debt.\nThe strategy — known among tax practitioners as a \"stock-for-debt swap\" — relies on mathematical sleight of hand. Say a company can repay only $60 million of a $100 million bank loan. If the bank forgives the remaining $40 million, the company faces a large tax bill because it will have to report that canceled $40 million debt as taxable income.\nClever tax lawyers found a way around this inconvenience. The company would simply swap stock for the $40 million in debt it could not repay. This way, it would look as if the entire $100 million loan had been repaid, and presto: There would be no tax bill due for $40 million in canceled debt.\nBest of all, it did not matter if the actual market value of the stock was considerably less than the $40 million in canceled debt. (Stock in an effectively insolvent company could easily be next to worthless.) Even in the opaque, rarefied world of gaming impenetrable tax regulations, this particular maneuver was about as close as a company could get to waving a magic wand and making taxes disappear.\nAlarmed by the obvious potential for abuse, Congress and the I.R.S. made repeated efforts during the 1980s to curb this brand of tax wizardry before banning its use by corporations altogether in 1993. But while policy makers were busy trying to stop corporations from using this particular ploy, the endlessly creative club of elite tax advisers was inventing a new way to circumvent the ban, this time through the use of partnerships.\nThis was the twist that was especially beneficial to Mr. Trump. Wealthy families like the Trumps often own real estate and other assets through partnerships rather than corporations. Mr. Trump, for example, owned all three of his Atlantic City casinos through partnerships, an arrangement that allowed casino profits to flow directly to his personal tax returns when times were good.\nBut what if times were bad? What if Mr. Trump's casino partnerships could not repay hundreds of millions of dollars they owed to bondholders? And what if the bondholders were persuaded to forgive this debt? Wouldn't that force the partnerships — i.e., Mr. Trump — to report hundreds of millions of dollars of taxable income in the form of canceled debt?\nEnter the tax advisers with their audacious plan: Why not eliminate all that taxable income from canceled debt by swapping \"partnership equity\" for debt in exactly the same way corporations had been swapping company stock for debt.\nTrue enough, the I.R.S. and Congress had clearly signaled their disapproval of the basic concept. Fred T. Goldberg, who was the I.R.S. commissioner under George Bush, recalled in an interview that the I.R.S. frowned on partnership equity-for-debt swaps for the same reason it objected to corporate stock-for-debt swaps. \"The fiction is that the partnership interest has the same value as the debt,\" he said. Lee A. Sheppard, a contributing editor to Tax Notes, wrote in 1991 that trying to find a legal justification for this tactic was akin to proving \"the existence of the Loch Ness monster.\"\nOn the campaign trail, Mr. Trump boasts of his mastery of tax loopholes and claims no other candidate for the White House has ever known more about the tax code. This background, he argues with evident disgust, gives him special insight into the way wealthy elites buy off politicians and hire high-priced lawyers and accountants to rig the tax system — just as, he claims, they rig elections.\nThat insight was on display in 1991 and 1992 when he was laying the groundwork to make a multimillion-dollar tax bill disappear.\nBefore proceeding with his plan, Mr. Trump did what most prudent taxpayers do — he sought a formal tax opinion letter. Such letters, typically written by highly-paid lawyers who spend entire careers mastering the roughly 10,000 pages of ever-changing statutes that make up the United States tax code, can provide important protection to taxpayers. As long as a tax adviser blesses a particular tax strategy in a formal opinion letter, the taxpayer most likely will not face penalties even if the I.R.S. ultimately rules the strategy was improper.\nThe language used in tax opinion letters has a specialized meaning understood by all tax professionals. So, for example, when a tax lawyer writes that a shelter is \"more likely than not\" going to be approved by the I.R.S., this means there is at least a 51 percent chance the shelter will withstand scrutiny. (This is known as an \"M.L.T.N.\" letter in the vernacular of tax lawyers.) A \"should\" letter means there is about a 75 percent chance the I.R.S. will not object. The gold standard, a \"will\" letter, means the I.R.S. is all but certain to bless the tax avoidance strategy.\nBut the opinion letters Mr. Trump received from his tax lawyers at Willkie Farr & Gallagher were far from the gold standard. The letters bluntly warned that there was no statute, regulation or judicial opinion that explicitly permitted Mr. Trump's tax gambit. \"Due to the lack of definitive judicial or administrative authority,\" his lawyers wrote, \"substantial uncertainties exist with respect to many of the tax consequences of the plan.\"\nOne letter, 25 pages long, analyzed seven distinct components of Mr. Trump's proposed tax maneuver. It found only \"substantial authority\" for six of the components. In the stilted language of tax opinion letters, the phrase \"substantial authority\" is a red flag that the lawyers believe the I.R.S. can be expected to rule against the taxpayer roughly two-thirds of the time. In other words, Mr. Trump's tax lawyers were telling him there were at least six different reasons the I.R.S. would likely cry foul if he were audited. In anticipation of that possibility, the lawyers even laid out a fallback plan that would have allowed Mr. Trump to spread the pain of a large tax hit over many years if the I.R.S. ultimately balked.\nIt is unclear whether the I.R.S. ever challenged Mr. Trump's use of this specific tax maneuver. According to a financial disclosure statement prepared by Mr. Trump's accountants, he was under audit by tax authorities as of 1993, only a year after he avoided reporting hundreds of millions of dollars in taxable income because of this legally suspect tactic. But the results of that audit are unknown and the agency declined to comment on Monday.\nRegardless of whether the I.R.S. objected, Mr. Trump's tax avoidance in this case violated a central principle of American tax law, said Mr. Buckley, the former chief of staff for Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation who later served as chief tax counsel for Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee.\n\"He deducted somebody else's losses,\" Mr. Buckley said. By that Mr. Buckley means that only the bondholders who forgave Mr. Trump's unpaid casino debts should have been allowed to use those losses to offset future income and reduce their taxes. That Mr. Trump used the same losses to reduce his taxes ultimately increases the tax burden on everyone else, Mr. Buckley explained. \"He is double dipping big time.\"\nIn any event, Mr. Trump can no longer benefit from the same maneuver. Just as Congress acted in 1993 to ban stock-for-debt swaps by corporations, it acted in 2004 to ban equity-for-debt swaps by partnerships.\nAmong the members of Congress who voted to finally close the loophole: Senator Hillary Clinton of New York.", "timestamp": "2016-11-01", "title": "Statement on Trump's \"Legally Dubious\" Tax Avoidance Scheme"}

EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome aboard Air Force One. We're on our way to Columbus, Ohio. This is a state that President Obama won twice when he was running for President, so he's got a solid track record in this state. The President has already visited Ohio to advocate for the election of not just Secretary Clinton to the presidency, but also former Governor Ted Strickland to the United States Senate.\nThere also will be a number of state legislative candidates that President Obama has endorsed. And this is was as good example as any of a state where the President is making a case on behalf of Democrats up and down the ballot. The audience will be largely young people, and it's an indication of the particular emphasis that the President is placing on trying to encourage young Americans to be active in our democracy and to ensure that they participate in this election.\nSo other than that, we can go straight to your questions.\nQ: The New York Times reported on an FBI investigation into Donald Trump's connections to Russia and some of his associates' connections to Russian associates. So I'm wondering if the White House, how involved you were in that, if you kept tabs on that investigation at all, if you were briefed along the way.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kathleen, several weeks ago the intelligence community released an assessment indicating their conclusion that Russia was engaging in malicious activity in cyberspace in an effort to undermine confidence in the U.S. political system. That represents the consensus view of the intel community. They also concluded that some of the information that they obtained through that malicious activity was released consistent with the tactics that we've seen the Russian government use in other countries to try to destabilize their political systems. Given the significance of this kind of activity, the intelligence community concluded that this kind of activity could only be authorized at the most senior levels of the Russian government.\nThe President is concerned about the consequences of that kind of an assessment, and he and his national security team have been monitoring this situation closely. You've heard the Secretary of Homeland Security talk about the kind of resources and expertise that are maintained at the Department of Homeland Security to assist election administrators across the country as they fortify their systems against potential Russian intrusions.\nThe President has given voice to his own confidence in our election system to make sure that as people are reading these news reports, that it doesn't cause them to call into question the likelihood that their vote -- that any vote that they cast on Election Day will be counted, and that the outcome of the election will reflect the will of the people who show up to vote on Election Day.\nThe President has got complete confidence that our system of democracy and our system of administering elections is durable and strong. But he's mindful of the national security threat that this kind of malicious behavior shows, and he's going to monitor it closely.\nWhat's also true, however, is that any sort of investigation -- criminal investigation that arises from that assessment is something that will be conducted by investigators at the Department of Justice and at the FBI. And, as we discussed at some length yesterday, those sorts of investigations are conducted independent of any sort of political interference. That is a longstanding norm and tradition that is maintained by the Department of Justice, and the Obama White House has been scrupulous about adhering to guidelines that urge against even the appearance of political interference.\nIf there's a decision that is made to discuss any investigations publicly, those are decisions that are made by officials at the Department of Justice and at the FBI. And they certainly are not made at the behest of anybody who works at the White House.\nQ: So you're saying you were not briefed on this investigation into Donald Trump's and the Trump Organization's dealings with Russian banks and other groups in Russia?\nMR. EARNEST: As I mentioned yesterday, the White House is not briefed on criminal investigations that are conducted by career prosecutors at the Department of Justice and the FBI. That principle applies whether the targets of that investigation are famous or not. That principle applies whether there's an election around the corner or not.\nSo the President is certainly mindful of and monitoring threats to our political system that could be emanating from Russia. But any sort of criminal investigation that is conducted is one that is led by career prosecutors with the assistance of the FBI. They are going to follow the facts where they lead. They will carefully examine the evidence, and they will make the prosecutorial investigative decisions that are required to reach a conclusion. And that's something that they will do without any guidance or influence from the White House.\nQ: Josh, the FBI also released some documents about the Clinton Foundation and an investigation into the pardon of Marc Rich by President Clinton in the 1990s. Is the White House aware of this? The Clinton campaign is apparently unhappy that the FBI released this information just days before the election.\nMR. EARNEST: I did see the tweet from the FBI records vault. That's the first time I've ever noticed a tweet from the FBI records vault. I'm not aware that the White House was consulted before that material was disseminated. That only happened shortly before we left. But based on the information I've been able to collect in just the last 45 minutes, I have not spoken to anybody who has any awareness of being consulted about that material before it was released.\nQ: Any concern that this information that could impact the election is being released just five days -- or just a week before the election?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I would refer those questions to the person that's responsible for operating the @FBIRecordsVault Twitter handle, whoever that person is.\nQ: Josh, you talked yesterday about the President's view of Director Comey's decision that you didn't defend, you didn't criticize. Does he feel the need to speak to this specifically himself? Will he do that today?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware that the President will make any specific reference to this situation in his prepared remarks today. The President is doing a couple of radio interviews after the event today. We'll get you some more information on that. There certainly is the potential that he could get asked about this situation. But based on the number of conversations that I had with him in advance of yesterday's briefing, I would be surprised if he says anything materially different than what I conveyed to you yesterday.\nQ: And does the President still stand by Director Comey? Would he advise Secretary Clinton, if she were to be President, that -- or Donald Trump, if he were to succeed President Obama -- that he could have confidence in that FBI Director?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as I noted yesterday, the President believes that Director Comey is a man of integrity, that he's a man of principle. There's a reason that he serves -- that he was nominated by President Obama to serve as the Director of the FBI. There's also a reason that he was appointed to serve in a high-ranking position at the Department of Justice when President Bush was in office. There's also a reason that a majority of Democrats and a majority of Republicans in the United States Senate both voted to confirm him to the position of the Director of the FBI. And the President, as I noted yesterday, continues to have confidence in his ability to do that job.\nWhat advice he'll eventually offer to the President-elect is something that I may be in a position to discuss at greater length once there is a President-elect.\nQ: Josh, can you just talk a little about how the President has been experiencing being on the campaign trail this much, particularly given this coming week? He's obviously doing more campaign stops consecutively than probably since 2012 -- what that's been like, how he's felt about it, and where his mind is right now.\nMR. EARNEST: Those of you who have been covering many of these public appearances have recognized the President is having a heck of a good time being on the campaign trail. The President enjoys the interaction that he has in the rope lines, he enjoys the opportunity to address a large and spirited audience that he encounters most places where he campaigns. And the President is not just having a good time, he looks like he's having a good time. And I think he's mindful of the fact that over the course of this week, this will essentially be the last big campaign swing of his political career. So I think he's looking forward to making a spirited case in support of Secretary Clinton and of Democrats up and down the ballot.\nPart of this is an indication of just how significant he thinks the stakes are in this election. And he's made that case pretty directly. Making the decision between the Republican and Democratic candidates is not something that the American people should take lightly. There are significant consequences for the outcome of this race. And I think that's part of the President's motivation.\nPart of the President's motivation is that he believes strongly that Secretary Clinton would be an excellent President. And that's based on his knowledge of her three-decade career in public service. It's also based on his experience in running against her for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2007 and 2008. It's also based on his experience watching her serve as his Secretary of State. She did a remarkable job of advancing our interests around the globe. He's also seen first-hand as she thinks about complicated issues, as she thinks about how best to protect the American people. And he believes she would do an excellent job sitting in the Oval Office.\nAnd finally, I'll say that this is a reflection of the deep reservoir of political support that the President has all across the country. There's a reason that Secretary Clinton's team has asked President Obama to maintain such an aggressive travel schedule. They believe that he is a particularly effective messenger in making the case for Secretary Clinton to the American people. And given his own passion for Secretary Clinton's candidacy, he has eagerly accepted Secretary Clinton's team's invitation to be a visible presence on the campaign trail in the last week before the election.\nQ: Josh, does the White House have any -- or has it been given any intelligence from the intelligence agencies about a possible launch of a missile by North Korea in the coming days?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't been briefed on any intelligence assessment. But we can certainly look into that to see if there's more that we have to share.\nQ: And in the same region of the world, has the President been paying attention to the erupting political crisis in South Korea with regard to President Park and her advisor there?\nMR. EARNEST: I've read some of the news accounts that some of your news outlets have written. I have not spoken to the President about those stories. I think what I would just reiterate as a general matter is that the alliance between the United States and the Republic of Korea is strong and durable. And the President has had the opportunity to work closely with President Park. He met with her earlier this fall in Laos to talk about the shared security concerns that we have in that region of the world. And the two leaders had an opportunity to talk in some detail about our efforts to cooperate to provide for the security of the South Korean people. And that alliance remains strong, and our commitment to that alliance remains strong.\nAs it relates to the domestic political situation in South Korea, that's an issue for the South Korean people to discuss and debate -- something I wouldn't weigh in on from here. And I think that's -- my reluctance to weigh in on that I think is an indication of the overriding priority that the Obama administration places on our alliance with the Republic of Korea.\nQ: Anything more about Ohio, about what we'll be doing there, why it's important to him?\nMR. EARNEST: I'll have some additional details once we land about other interviews that the President is doing after the event. But other than that, I think I covered it at the top.\nQ: There are some folks that are looking at early vote data and Democrats worrying that the African American vote doesn't seem to be coming out in the same numbers as it did with the President. Is the President worried about that? Or are political advisors concerned about African American turnout?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think each state -- in some ways, each community -- is unique. But I think what I could just say in general, without speaking to the numbers in any one community, is that I think the President has made a pretty direct pitch to his supporters in the African American community about the fact that his legacy is at stake in this election. Frankly, that's a pitch that he's made to all of his supporters. But it's a pitch that he would expect would resonate most deeply among the African American community.\nThe African American community across the country has supported President Obama in overwhelming fashion. And he's deeply grateful for the loyalty and energy that his African American supporters have shown to him, not just as a candidate for President, but also while he's been in office. And the President's pitch has essentially been: You need to go out there and be active and be engaged, and just as energetic about Secretary Clinton if you're interested in seeing our country maintain the progress that we've made over the last eight years, because you've got a clear choice between a candidate that's looking to build on that progress and a candidate who is vowing to tear it down.\nSo you'll hear a strain of that argument in the President's remarks today. And I think it will be a hallmark of the argument that he'll make over the course of this week leading up to Election Day.\nQ: Josh, Donald Trump has called for supporters to turn out as unofficial election observers in some of the states -- Ohio, Pennsylvania. Some Democrats are worried about voter intimidation at the polls. Is that something that has hit the President's radar? Is he concerned about that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, it's the responsibility of local jurisdictions to administer their elections. And many of those jurisdictions have very specific rules about who's allowed to be in a polling place on Election Day. In some cases, there are registration procedures, and in some cases there are rules about being a registered voter in that precinct in order to be in that polling place. The President has got a lot of confidence that all of those rules will be effectively and fairly enforced. And the President continues to be confident. And you've seen similar expressions of confidence from the Department of Justice that we expect that in the vast majority of polling places, Election Day procedures will be smoothly implemented and properly adhered to.\nQ: There continues to be ongoing protests over the Dakota Access Pipeline. I'm wondering, does the White House believe that the federal government has done a good-enough job of consulting with Native communities there? And are there going to be continued consultations to sort of deal with the reason that so many people are protesting?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Toluse, the Dakota Access Pipeline project itself is the subject of some ongoing litigation that you guys have closely covered. So there's not much that I can say about that particular project. What I can say more generally is that the White House has been in touch with the Department of Interior and a couple of other agencies that are taking a fresh look at the procedures that they follow to incorporate input from Native American communities that could potentially be affected by infrastructure projects. The President believes that that's a worthwhile thing for the Department of Interior to do. And so he's supportive of that process to consider reforming some of those procedures.\nBut with respect to the individual project, that's just something I can't quite comment on because of the fact that it's under -- in litigation right now.\nEND 4:07 P.M.

[applause]\nWe have a lot of very enthused and excited people in this campaign. So I really do thank all of you. [applause]\nI would like to thank my incredible running mate, Mike Pence, on the tremendous job he's done. And he's a fantastic leader and a leader on health care...[applause]\nI'd also like to thank Dr. Ben Carson. [applause]\nNot only a great man, and I don't say that about a lot of people, but one of the toughest competitors I've ever faced. People don't know how well he did during those primaries. And I just kept looking back. And I just kept seeing him. And boy, I'll tell you.\nBut even more importantly, he's a brilliant physician and I hope he will be very much involved with my administration in the coming years. [applause]\nThank you.\nI'd also like to recognize the distinguished members of Congress in attendance who have all been at the forefront of health care, and have been so helpful to me: Congresswoman Ellmers, Lummis; Congressmen Price, Harris, Burgess and DesJarlais. [applause]\nAnd let me give a special thanks to Senator Barrasso, a terrific doctor, a Senate leader, who did incredible work chairing our platform committee, just unbelievable work. So I want to thank you very much, Senator. Fantastic job. [applause]\nAnd been very, very loyal to what we're doing and what we represent. So thank you, Senator. When we win on November 8th...[applause]...and elect a Republican Congress, we will be able to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare. Have to do it. [applause]\nI will ask Congress to convene a special session so we can repeal and replace and it will be such an honor for me, for you and for everybody in this country because Obamacare has to be replaced. And we will do it and we will do it very, very quickly. It is a catastrophe. The president said if you like your plan, you can keep your plan. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.\nWhich may go down as one of the great political lies of the century. Even the skeptical Democrats believed him and approved the legislation. There were Democrats that were very much against it, but they believed him and they approved it. No one ever read, or certainly very few people, the 2,700 page bill. To this day, nobody understands it.\nThe Obama administration has just announced massive double digit and triple digit Obamacare premium hikes everywhere, all throughout the country. Here in Pennsylvania, premiums are going to increase more than 60 percent and that's nothing compared to what will happen in the future. Of course, in the future, I'm president, there won't be Obamacare, so you won't have to worry about it. [applause]\nThat means parents won't have enough money to pay their bills or get medicine for their kids. In the great state of Arizona, a wonderful place I just left, premiums will go up even higher than 116 percent. Other states are going up more than 60, 70, 80, 90 percent. Deductibles can go to $12,000, $13,000, $14,000, even $15,000. In other words, your health care won't even be usable. You're paying all this money, you won't even get to use it.\nPeople all across the country are devastated. In many instances, their health care costs are more than their mortgage costs or their rent which, by the way, is a first in American history. This is particularly unfair to millennials and younger Americans generally who will be totally crushed by these massive health care costs before they even get started on their journey through life.\nOne-third of the counties -- think of this, one-third of the counties in Pennsylvania will have only a single insurance company left if you have that. That includes Philadelphia, where I went to school. The Associated Press found that some of the 440,000 Pennsylvania consumers who buy insurance through healthcare.gov will face some of the highest premium increases in the nation. The people of Philadelphia. Insurers are leaving, premiums are soaring, doctors are quitting, companies are fleeing and deductibles go through the roof. Workers' hours are being cut, hiring is frozen -- totally frozen -- and wages are being slashed. Obamacare means higher prices, fewer choices and lower quality. Yet Hillary Clinton wants to expand Obamacare and make it even more expensive. She wants to put the government totally in charge of health care in America. If we don't repeal and replace Obamacare, we will destroy American health care forever.\nIt's one of the single most important reasons why we must win on November 8th, we must win. [applause]\nThank you. [applause]\nThank you.\nThank you very much, everybody. Thank you.\nOur replacement plan includes health savings accounts, a nationwide insurance market where you can purchase across state lines and letting states manage Medicaid dollars so much better. We will create quality, reliable, affordable health care in a free market where parents can make the health care decisions that they really wanna make for their families. It will be a much better health care at a much less expensive cost.\nWe've also outlined detailed solutions on so many other issues to make life better for every American family. And while this is really -- thank you. [applause]\nWhile this is really a meeting and that's what it is, it's a meeting of very, very special people and I appreciate you all being here. But it's a meeting talking about health care and Obamacare. Our plan for other things also include the bringing back of manufacturing jobs. We have to do it. [applause] We're gonna bring back your manufacturing, we're gonna bring back our jobs that formed the backbone of the American middle class and our country as a whole\nOur jobs are being stolen. Pennsylvania has lost almost 40 percent of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton. The city of Philadelphia has lost more than one-third of its manufacturing jobs since China joined the Word Trade Organization, another Bill and Hillary-backed disaster.\nA Trump administration will renegotiate NAFTA, believe me. And we have the greatest negotiators in the world. We will use our great negotiators. [applause]\nWe'll have a fair deal, but we'll have a deal that goes in two directions, not one direction, right into Mexico and these other places. [applause]\nAnd stand up to foreign product dumping, currency manipulation and unfair subsidy behavior. [applause]\nWe are going to bring manufacturing jobs, lots of jobs, back to Pennsylvania. We're gonna do it. And it won't even be difficult. [applause]\nWe're going to open modern mines and take care of our great miners. Our miners have been mistreated horribly. [applause]\nWe will be producing clean coal, oil, natural gas and shale energy. [applause]\nWe're also bringing back our steel workers who have been so badly hurt, so badly hurt. [applause]\nWhose jobs have been stolen by the dumping of steel all over the state, and frankly, all over this country, by China and other countries. Nobody has been treated worse than these workers, but that will change on January 20th of next year, believe me. It will change. [applause]\nWe're also going to provide the children of the state with school choice. So important. [applause]\nThat means parents can spend and take care of their children, but they can send their kids to public school, to private, to chartered, to magnet, to religious or to home school. It's going to be their right and it's going to be something that's so, so good for your children and for the education of your children. [applause]\nWe will also totally eliminate Common Core and bring education local. We're gonna bring it local. [applause]\nPeople do not like Common Core in this country, that I can tell you. [laughter]\nAnd our system is failing, so it's obviously not working. We're gonna eliminate Common Core, we're gonna bring it local.\nOur tax plan will provide a 35 percent tax cut to middle class families with two kids. As an example, you have two kids, a 35 percent cut so desperately needed. Our middle class has not been properly respected, that I can tell you. [applause]\nWe will let parents deduct childcare expenses from their taxes and create tax-free childcare and elder care savings accounts with matching contributions for low income families. [applause]\nWe will eliminate the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military. When did we ever need it more? Greatest people on Earth in our military, but it's badly depleted. [applause]\nThank you. People love this country, don't they? Isn't it beautiful, right? Beautiful. [applause]\nIt's a beautiful thing to watch and see. And I see it all over the country, no matter where we go. And every time I say we are going to rebuild our depleted military, it's always the same response. It's an incredible response. [applause]\nOur Navy is the smallest it's been since World War I, think of that. Smallest since World War I. And rebuilding it will require a national effort. That's why I will ask my Secretary of the Navy to review facilities like the Philadelphia Navy Yard, I know it well. [applause]\nWith a long history of service to our Navy, proximity to vibrant private industry and room for expansion to enlist them in the rebuilding of what will be a great fleet again. [applause]\nTo recruit master craftsmen this buildup requires and we will establish centers of excellence at locations like the Philadelphia Navy Yard.\nVocational training is a great thing. We don't do it anymore. We don't do it anymore. [applause]\nAnd I must tell you, so often in going to college right down the road and going to college, we have people that were brilliant and we had other people that weren't as brilliant in that way but were brilliant, incredible when it came to fixing a motor, when it came to fixing something that I had no idea what was happening and other great geniuses had no idea what was happening and they could take it apart blindfolded. And we don't do that anymore. Vocational training for our country is so, so, so important. [applause]\nAnd just in closing -- and they loved it. They loved it. They didn't want to be doing what I was doing. They loved it. They were so good at it and they loved it. So vocational training, we're going to start it up big league. [applause]\nWe will rebuild our military and we will rebuild our country. I'm not a politician. My only special interest is you, the American people. That's why I've done this. [applause]\nThank you very much. [applause]\nThe guiding rule of the political class in Washington, D.C. is that they are looking out only for themselves, only for themselves with the exception of these few people. [laughter]\nI feel guilty as I'm looking, they're staring me in the eyes. So I have to say with these exceptions. They will say anything and do anything and cling to their power and prestige at your expense. I'm running to change and reverse decades of failure and to work with the American people to create generations of success. I'm running... [applause]\nI'm running to restore honesty to our government and safety to our communities. We need safety. And by the way, our law enforcement officials, these are great, great people. [applause]\nThank you. And we are going to give great prosperity to our economy. I want to go into our poorest communities and work on a national plan of revitalization, the inner cities. [applause]\nAnd I've been working with so many African-American groups. These are such incredible people. We've been talking about it, working on it. We're going to bring jobs into the inner cities. We're going to bring safety. We're going to bring education, good, good schools into the inner cities. [applause]\nThe spirit of the people in the inner cities is beyond the spirit of anybody. And it's gonna work. It's gonna work. You watch. Americans are tired of being told to defer their dreams to another day. But politicians for the most part really mean another decade, because that's what they're talking about. Enough waiting. Time is now.\nBut to accomplish our goals, we must cut our ties with the small, bitter, petty politics of the past. We must declare our independence from a failed establishment that has squandered $6 trillion on foreign wars in the Middle East that never end, that we never win and that have made us far less safe. Think of it. [applause]\nThink of all the money that's spent, all the lives that have been lost.\nAnd we're far less safe today than we were before we started. They've left our borders wide open at home and shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries.\nIt's time for new leadership. [applause]\nI've led a great life and I truly love our country. So now I want to give back to the country that's been so good to me, that's why I'm doing this. [applause]\nAll I see everywhere I travel in this nation, and I've been everywhere, is untapped potential waiting to be realized. The people are amazing, the people are amazing. If we unlock the potential of this country and its incredible people, no dream is outside of our reach. [applause]\nIf we stopped believing in our failed politicians and start believing in ourselves, then anything, anything is possible. [applause]\nI'm asking you to dream big, to push for bold change and to believe in a movement powered by our love for each other and our love for our country. [applause]\nThat is how we will truly make America great again. [applause]\nThank you very much, thank you everybody. God bless you, thank you.

Klein, in his capacity as a candidate for county prosecutor in Franklin County, OH.

Hello, Columbus! O-H!\nAudience members. I-O!\nThe President. O-H!\nAudience members. I-O!\nThe President. Oh, it is good to be back!\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nThe President. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nNow, let me just, first of all—let me ask you a question here. What did everybody have to drink before you came in here? [Laughter] You guys had something caffeinated, because you seem pretty fired up! You seem like you're ready to go! You seem fired up, Ohio!\nLet me begin by, first of all, thanking your outstanding Congresswoman, Joyce Beatty, for that introduction. You've got Mayors Ben Kessler and Andrew Ginther here. Your next United States Senator, Ted Strickland.\nLet me ask a sensitive question for a Chicagoan: How many Cleveland Indian fans in the house? [Laughter] I just want you to know that you don't have to worry, because we will get you out of this auditorium before the first pitch. So you're all good. And because I've been watching the World Series, I am aware that, because Francisco Lindor stole second base in game 1, everyone in America gets a free taco at Taco Bell tomorrow. Yes! [Laughter] I mean, this guy was so fired up about the free taco, look at him. I have never seen anybody so excited about a free taco, this guy right here. [Laughter]\nNow, there is a reason—the reason I'm bringing this up: If you can find the time to get a free taco, then you can find the time to go vote. If you can find the time to go to Taco Bell—[laughter]—you can find the time to go to iwillvote.com, find your nearest early voting location, and cast your ballot. And although election day may be 1 week away, here in Ohio, you can vote right now. [Applause] You can vote right now. You can vote and then go get your taco. It's like a combo meal. [Laughter] It's like you get something good for your soul and then you get something good for your appetite.\nSo I am working as hard as I can—and I'm asking you to spend the rest of this week working as hard as you can—to make sure that the next President of the United States is Hillary Rodham Clinton. Work as hard for her as you worked for me. And——\nAudience members. Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!\nThe President. Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!\nNow, I know you're already working hard. First of all, here at—folks at Capital University, they—I know that they are a purposeful group of young people, that young people at this university understand the stakes and they're going to make sure to vote. And all across the State, we've got this incredible organizing program. More than 63,000 volunteers have registered tens of thousands of voters. More than 6 million phone calls have been made. Yes! And thanks in part to your hard work, more than a million Ohioans have already cast their ballot.\nSo I know you're working. I know some of you are tired. I know some of you are thinking, maybe I need a break. [Laughter] But this is one week that you can't get a break, because this week will decide the future of this country that we love.\nAnd look, I don't have to tell you, Ohio is always a battleground State. I was here so many days during my final days of both my campaigns that I would have, like, pockets full of buckeyes at the end of the day. I mean, I just—I was just parked here. And you delivered for me.\nAnd I told you—but remember, remember what I told you at the time. I said, look, my slogan is not, \"Yes, I can,\" my slogan is \"Yes, we can.\" I told you back then that I wasn't—I told you I wasn't a perfect man and I wouldn't be a perfect President, but I told you I would work as hard as I could every single day to make sure that your lives were a little bit better. And I've kept that promise.\nI've kept that promise because I remember the conversations we had: with autoworkers who had been laid off, with folks who didn't have health care, with young people who were trying to figure out how to afford college. And over the course of these 8 years, we have battled back from what was almost a Great Depression so that now incomes are rising again and poverty is falling again. And businesses have turned job losses into 15 million new jobs. And 20 million people have health care that didn't have it before. And autoworkers are back on the job producing the best cars in the world. The uninsured rate has gone down. We're covering more than 90 percent of Americans for the first time in history.\nWe've kicked our addiction to foreign oil, sparked a clean energy revolution. America is a leader in fighting against climate change. We've doubled our production of clean energy. We've brought back our outstanding men and women in uniform from Afghanistan and Iraq. And we pursued Usama bin Laden until he met justice.\nWe've seen a country that reinvigorated the cause of civil rights. We have become a country where a freedom that was limited to just a few is now a right guaranteed to everybody: the freedom to marry who you love.\nAnd all of this happened because of you. I mean, I was your front man—[laughter]—but you were the band. And all across the country, I've seen what has always made America great is its people: people working hard, people starting their own businesses, teachers reaching into their own pockets to make sure their kids had school supplies. I've seen doctors serve the poor. I've seen our men and women in uniform, our brave police officers, and first responders running towards danger to keep us safe. I've seen the patriotism of young activists speaking out for what's right, even when it's uncomfortable, part of a young generation calling us to live up to our highest ideals.\nI have seen Americans of every faith and every party who know that we're stronger together—young and old, men and women, Black, White, Latino, Asian, Native American, people with disabilities—all pledging allegiance to the red, white, and blue. That's the America I know. And there's only one candidate in this race who has devoted her life to a better America, and that's the next President of the United States, Hillary Clinton.\nBut make no mistake: This is not something you can take for granted. All the progress we've made goes out the window if we don't do our jobs in these next 7 days. Our future depends on what you do these next 7 days. And at the end of the campaign, I know there are all sorts of negative ads and there's noise and there's distractions. But I want you to tune all that out. I want you to focus on the choice that you face in this election.\nDonald Trump——\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. Don't boo!\nAudience members. Vote!\nThe President. Vote! Don't boo, vote! Booing doesn't help. Voting helps.\nDonald Trump is uniquely unqualified to be President. He is temperamentally unfit to be Commander in Chief. Don't take my word for it. Take the word of a lot of the Republicans who were saying this before they decided, politically, that it was convenient to support him. And then, some of them decided, politically, it was inconvenient to support him again. And they keep on doing backflips.\nBut think about what they said at the outset: that he was a \"con man,\" that he didn't have the temperament to do the job, that he didn't have the knowledge to do the job, didn't have the experience to do the job. Somebody who claims to be a great businessman, but who repeatedly stiffs small businesses and their—and workers out of what he owes them.\nAnd let me say this, because I was talking to you—some folks here on the way over, and I said to them, if you're a working person, if you are out there every day working hard, punching a clock, the notion that this guy is your champion——\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. The notion that this guy is going to fight for working people, when his entire life he did not have time for anybody who wasn't rich or a celebrity, who wouldn't let you into one of his hotels unless you were cleaning the room, wouldn't let you onto one of his golf courses unless you were mowing the fairway—come on! This guy is going to be your champion?\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. Come on! No, I—because there are a lot of working folks in Ohio, proud people who make an honest living. And I hear them saying, well, I don't know, Trump, maybe he's not so bad. Come on! [Laughter] This guy?\nI mean, it would be one thing if you were thinking about voting for somebody who had been in the trenches, who knew what it was like maybe to not have enough money at the end of the month, who's—maybe had seen their parents working in a coal mine or on an assembly line and knew what it was like to not be able to afford college and had done his best—maybe you'd think about some of the stuff he's saying. But this guy? Don't be bamboozled. Don't let a—don't run for that okey-doke. Come on! Come on! That guy didn't have a—had never worn a baseball hat or a seed hat until he started selling them to make some money. [Laughter] Come on. Come on, take that off. [Laughter] No, no, no, wait, wait, wait! Don't boo. Don't boo.\nAudience members. Vote!\nThe President. Vote! Although, I would also check to see where that was made, because I'll bet it's made in China.\nAnd then, this is the only candidate in decades—the only one—who refuses to release any tax returns whatsoever.\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. Now, maybe this is because he's not as rich as he says he is. But maybe it's because—he admits—he hasn't paid his Federal income taxes in years, which he says makes him smart. But actually what it means is, after this country has given everything to you, you're not going to give a single dime back to our troops or our veterans or building roads or building bridges or to our universities so that young people can get an education. Come on!\nSays he'll be his own foreign policy adviser, because he says he's got a \"good brain.\" [Laughter] Who talks like that? [Laughter] We can't afford a President whose brain has suggested that we should torture people again or ban entire religions from our country, who insults POWs or attacks Gold Star mothers or talks down to our troops and our veterans. Even a Republican Senator said we can't afford to give the nuclear codes to somebody so erratic.\nI mean, I think Hillary made a pretty good point: You—a man you can bait with a tweet is not somebody you want to trust with nuclear weapons.\nSo I want to, in particular, talk to working people out there who are thinking about—even thinking about working—voting for this guy. Somebody who spent 70 years on this Earth showing no regard for working people, open disdain not just for immigrants or Muslims, but Americans with disabilities. And we know what he said about women. This is the guy that you want to be representing the entire country all around the world?\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. And by the way, by the way, this is not just one tape where he's bragging about how being famous allows him to get away with actions that qualify as sexual assault. This is a lifetime of calling women pigs and dogs and slobs and grading women on a 10-point scale.\nAnd—but part of what I'm concerned about is, we start acting like this is normal. And I hear people saying, well, this is just locker-room talk. I've been in a locker—I've been in lot of locker rooms. And I—look, I'll admit you wouldn't want to publish everything said in a locker room, but that wasn't said. This is habitual. And it is a part of who he is.\nAnd when I hear people justifying it or making excuses or saying, well, I don't like that part of his—what he says, but I support his policies, and when I hear Republican officials saying, as long as he's willing to pass our budget and our tax cuts, then we're supporting him—let me tell you something about this office. Who you are, what you are does not change once you occupy the Oval Office. It doesn't. It all—the only thing this office does is, it amplifies who you are. It magnifies who you are. It shows who you are.\nIf you disrespected women before you were elected, you will disrespect women once you're President. If you tolerate supporters who are Klan sympathizers before you're elected, then you'll receive their support once you're in office. If you disrespect the Constitution by threatening to shut down the press when it doesn't say things you like or threatening to throw your opponent in jail or discriminating against people of different faiths—if you do that before you are elected, then what are you going to do when you have actual power to do those things?\nSo don't act like this is normal. This is not your typical election. Look, we all have Republican friends. This guy with the hat actually looks like a nice guy. [Laughter] He's got a nice smile on his face. I—look, we all know Republican friends, family members who don't act or think the way Trump does. But the problem is, is that things have become so polarized that people start talking themselves into saying, well, maybe it's not so bad. But it is. It really is. It really is.\nThis is not somebody you want your kids saying is the President of the United States. Because our kids will learn from it. And you don't want somebody who really doesn't know what they're doing or show any curiosity about knowing what they're doing to hold this job.\nSo—but the good news is, Ohio, all of you are uniquely qualified to make sure he doesn't get that chance. All you've got to do is vote.\nAnd these are not equal candidates. There's only one who is actually worthy of your vote, who is smart, who is steady, who is tested, whose heart is in the right place, who is probably the most qualified person ever to run for this office. And that is Hillary Clinton.\nAudience members. Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!\nThe President. This—Hillary is somebody who we know has dedicated her life to making this country a stronger, better place. Works hard every single day.\nAudience member. I love you, Obama!\nThe President. She—I love you back. But I want to talk about Hillary for a second. [Laughter]\nI saw her as my Secretary of State. I saw her in the Situation Room, making arguments to go after bin Laden even though it was risky, tirelessly circling the globe as Secretary of State, respected around the world. Her efforts are not always flashy, and they're not always appreciated here at home, but she made me a better President, and she didn't ask for credit. And when she was challenged, she doesn't make things up on the spot. She doesn't double down on lies that obviously are lies, because there's video. [Laughter]\nShe actually understands the world. She understands the challenges we face. And when things don't go her way, she doesn't whine or complain or blame others or say everything is rigged. [Laughter] She doesn't say the polls are great when the polls are in her favor, and then when they don't go in her favor, the polls stink and nobody knows what they're talking about. She just works harder, and she comes back better.\nAnd she knows that the decisions that a President makes mean whether or not somebody gets a job out there. It means whether a veteran is getting the right care or not; means whether a soldier is going to be put in harm's way or not. Knows what it means to parents trying to make ends meet; or a worker at the plant, whether that plant stays open; or a student who's trying to go to a college for the first time; or a young person who's brought to this country as a baby and now just wants to contribute to the only home she's ever known. Hillary knows they need a champion. And she has concrete plans to do what she promises. She's thought it through. And she values hard work, and she respects working Americans. And she'll be a Commander in Chief who finishes the job of defeating ISIL. And she will be a smart and steady President of the United States.\nBut look, I just want to be honest with you, because she's been out there for so long, sometimes in this culture, we always want to see the new, shiny object. And if you get beat up enough in this political environment that's so toxic, after a while people, start believing stuff. Hillary Clinton is consistently treated differently than just about any other candidate I see out there. And as I said, some of it is, she's just been around a long time and so people kind of—they just believe whatever is said by the other side in their systematic attacks. And it wears on people's attitudes. And over time, they go, well, maybe—no, no, no, do not believe that stuff.\nHas she made mistakes? Of course. So have I. There's nobody in the public arena over the course of 30 years that doesn't make some. But she is a fundamentally good and decent person who knows what she's doing and will be an outstanding President.\nAnd by the way, I just want to say it, to the guys out there—I want to be honest—you know, there's a reason why we haven't had a woman President before. And I think that sometimes we're kind of trying to get over the hump. And we have to ask ourselves as men—because I hope my daughters are going to be able to achieve anything they want to achieve, and I know that my wife is not just my equal, but my superior. That I want us—I want every man out there who's voting to kind of look inside yourself and ask yourself, well, how—if you're having problems with this stuff, how much of it is that we're just not used to it. So that, like, when a guy is ambitious and out in the public arena and working hard, well, that's okay; but when a woman suddenly does it, suddenly, you're all, like, well, why is she doing that?\nI'm just being honest. I want you to think about it, because she is so much better qualified than the other guy. She has conducted herself so much better in public life than the other guy, that this notion that the—somehow, oh, you know, this is hard to choose—it shouldn't be.\nAnd by the way, not only do we need to elect Hillary Clinton, but she's going to need allies, allies like Ted Strickland in the United States Senate. Because here's a guy who we know believes in protecting overtime pay so people get paid what they've earned, believes that workers should have the right to bargain for better pay and benefits. He's running against a guy who helped strip overtime from 6 million workers, backed a bill that would make it harder for workers to organize.\nTed has always stood for working people. In 2016, he believes that women should get equal pay for equal work. His opponent has voted against it five times. Ted supports, yes, commonsense gun safety measures like background checks and keeping assault weapons out of the hands of terrorists. His opponent blocked background checks and opposed a bill to just stop people on the terror watch list from buying a gun.\nAnd by the way, if you see these ads out there saying Hillary is trying to take your guns away, it is not true. It is a lie. Let's just call it what it is: It's a lie. It's a lie. It's—I'm not saying it's mischaracterization. It is a lie.\nAnd by the way, there's one more big difference between Ted Strickland and Rob Portman, and that is, Ted never supported Donald Trump. Ted's opponent was for him. Then, he kind of looked at the polls and said he was against him. [Laughter] You don't know what he's going to do this week. But you know what, you don't get credit for that. Being a leader is about doing the right thing when it's hard, not when it's easy. It's about doing what's right even when it costs you votes.\nThat's one of the reasons I'm so proud of Michelle right now. She doesn't love politics. It wasn't her first choice for our family. But she's been working her heart out for Hillary. And it's because not only does she believe in Hillary, but she also knows our kids are watching this election. And when she sees the way Trump behaves, she knows that should not be an example we set for our kids. She knows there's something fundamental at stake that goes beyond plans or policies, and that's the character of our country.\nWill we teach our kids to treat women as objects or as full and equal citizens capable of doing anything a man does and then some? Will we teach our kids to vilify immigrants or people with disabilities or Americans who practice different faiths, or will we say that out of many we are one, that we're stronger together than we could ever be apart? Will we teach our kids that politics is just a way to pitch a new hotel or a golf course or a TV contract or show them that public service in this democracy is a noble calling, that it gives us a chance to promote opportunity and justice and the common good?\nThat's what Hillary believes in. Her Methodist creed taught her, \"Do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, as long as ever you can.\" She believes that we can summon what's best in each of us and make the country a little bit better for all of us.\nAnd that's what this election is about. We—when I think back about these 8 years of service, I can tell you honestly that as hard as this job is sometimes, as frustrating as it sometimes is, you do this job for a while and your love for this country just grows and grows. And it becomes so profound, because you—this is a place like no other. It is founded on an idea that all of us are created equal; that you don't have to be born into wealth or privilege; that you don't have to look a certain way or have a certain last name to have a chance to make a difference.\nThat's what drove patriots to choose revolution over tyranny. That's what led GIs like my grandfather to help liberate a continent. That's what allowed women to reach for the ballot and marchers to cross a bridge in Selma and organizers here in Ohio to organize for better wages and better working conditions. That's what makes it—America exceptional.\nWe've always had the opportunity to make this country great by working hard, each and every one of us. And it's not about what somebody else will do for us, it's about what we can achieve together. And sometimes, it's slow, and sometimes, it's frustrating, but this idea of self-government, that's what makes us different. But it means we've got responsibilities. It means we don't treat elections like a reality show. It means that we pay attention. It means that we try to lift up folks who actually know what they're talking about and have shown throughout their careers that they care.\nAnd that's who Hillary is. She knows that in this democracy, in a big, diverse country like this, we don't demonize each other constantly. She knows that progress sometimes requires compromise, even when you're right, even when you're a hundred-percent right. She knows that none of us are perfect, not even Presidents, but we should try to conduct ourselves with the same honesty and decency and generosity that we try to do with our friends and our neighbors and our coworkers and our family. She knows that. And she will continue the progress that we've made these last 8 years.\nBut she needs our help. And she needs you not just to vote for her, but she's got to have a Republican Congress that behaves a little bit better than the Congress we've got right now. I mean, these folks don't just block my stuff. They don't just block a raise in the minimum wage. They don't just block an infrastructure bill that would put people back to work. They don't just block immigration reform. They don't just vote 60 times to take health insurance away from 60 million Americans. They can't even pass their own stuff.\nAll they offer is gridlock and obstruction and \"no.\" That's all we see out of them. They threaten to shut down the Government when they don't get their way. They threaten to wreck the economy when they don't get their way. They've given up on their own nominee, but they start promising even more unprecedented gridlock in Washington before we've even had the election.\nThey didn't work with me even though we were in the midst of a possible Great Depression when I came into office. They're sure as heck not going to work with Hillary now. Some are already talking about years of investigations, years of hearings, more shutdowns, more obstruction, more repeal votes. Some are already saying they won't appoint a ninth Supreme Court justice, boasting of their refusal to compromise, as if that's an accomplishment.\nHow does that help you? If you're a working man or woman out there, how does that help you? If you're a single mom out there trying to figure out how to pay the bills, how does that help you? If you're a student trying to finance your college education, how does that help you?\nAll this does is prevent what most Americans would consider actual accomplishments: fixing roads, putting people back to work, cleaning our environment, reforming immigration, educating our kids, keeping them safe. It would prevent us from getting that stuff done. That's all they're standing for right now.\nSo if you think a vote for gridlock is a good vote, then you should vote Republican. But if you think America can do better, if you care about creating jobs that families can live on, childcare they can afford, equal pay for equal work, you've got to vote Democrat up and down the ticket. You've got to vote for Hillary. Vote for Ted Strickland. Because they're ready to move this country forward.\nIf you've been marching for criminal justice reform, that's great. But you've got to vote for a President and a Congress who actually cares about disrupting the pipeline from underfunded schools to overcrowded jails. And by the way, you need to vote for a prosecutor right here in this county that makes sure we're doing the right thing. Up and down the ballot.\nIf you've been marching about the environment and climate change, well, you've got to vote for a President and a Congress who actually believe in science and will continue the progress we've made to lead the world.\nYou've been working to raise wages, well, that's great. You've got to vote for a President and a Congress that believes in a higher minimum wage, believes in giving families help to finance a college education, believes in immigration reform. You've got to vote for a President and a Congress who sees immigrants as more than criminals and rapists, but as people who love this country just like we do.\nMost of all—I'm wrapping up right now—if you believe in this country, then you cannot be cynical about it. You can't—as frustrating as these campaigns can sometimes feel, and I know they're long, they're too long—but you can't be cynical. You can—you have a chance to reject divisiveness. You have a chance to reject mean-spiritedness in our politics. You have a chance to reject those who would take us backwards and instead choose the progress that we can keep on making over the next 4 years, the next 8 years, the next 12 years. You can elect a leader who has spent her entire life trying to move this country forward. You can elect America's first female President to be an example for our daughters and our sons.\nSo don't let this chance slip away. You have the chance to make history. Don't let it slip away. Don't give away your power. I have said this before: The most important office in a democracy is not the office of President; it's not the office of Senator or mayor or Congressman or county commissioner. It is the office of citizen. You—you've got the most important office. And how you treat that precious responsibility, how you treat that duty to this country, that's the measure of your patriotism.\nSo I'm asking you today, don't be cynical. I'm asking you just what I asked you 8 years ago. I'm not asking you to believe in my ability to bring about change, not just in Hillary's ability to bring about change or Ted Strickland's. I'm asking you to believe in you: your ability to bring about change.\nAnd if these last 8 years have taught you anything, it's that change is possible. It's because of you, autoworkers right here in Ohio went from dark factories to double shifts; that thousands of our families have health care today that didn't have it before. It's the reason that a marine can proudly serve his country and he doesn't have to hide the husband he loves.\nIt's the reason that the young people have gotten Pell grants who didn't get them before. It's the reason that young immigrants have been able to come out of the shadows and serve in our Armed Forces or go back to school and contribute to this country they love.\nThe—I'm not on the ballot this time, Ohio. But progress is on the ballot. But fairness is on the ballot. But decency is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot. Our democracy is on the ballot. America is on the ballot. Hillary Clinton is on the ballot!\nYou've got to do everything you can this week not just to vote, but to get your friends, family, cousins, uncles, neighbors, coworkers—you've got to tell them this is the moment where we decide who America is, what we stand for. You have to stand up, reject cynicism, reject fear, reject meanness. Choose hope! Choose hope! Choose hope! Vote! Vote! Vote!\nIf you do, we will elect Hillary Clinton President. We'll elect Ted Strickland Senator. And we will continue this amazing journey, and we will finish what we started and show the rest of the world why this is the greatest country on the Earth.\nGod bless you, Ohio. I love you! God bless the United States of America! Let's get to work!", "timestamp": "2016-11-01", "title": "Remarks at a Campaign Rally for Democratic Presidential Nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton in Columbus, Ohio"}
{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119478", "text": "In response to new reporting from the Wall Street Journal on Donald Trump's dangerous and unprecedented foreign business entanglements, Hillary for America deputy communications director Christina Reynolds issued the following statement:\"Donald Trump has business all around the world, and while he has failed to disclose full details of his business record, what we know is truly disturbing. The idea of a President Trump trying to negotiate with foreign leaders while having his business at stake is simply unacceptable and raises real questions about how he would handle matters of national security. This is just one more reason why he cannot be president.\"\nIN CASE YOU MISSED IT\nKEY POINT: \"Those whom Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump have worked with abroad include: the family of a developer in India who is a ruling-party politician, an Azerbaijani government minister's son and a media company that became the Turkish president's outlet of choice during the July 15 coup attempt.\nNo recent president has had a portfolio of international business interests as extensive as Mr. Trump's—or as great a level of business engagement on his behalf by offspring, who have also played a role in his campaign.\"\nTrump's Foreign Business Entanglements Would Create Unparalleled Conflicts\nWall Street Journal\nBy Alexandra Berzon\nNovember 1, 2016\nHis adult children, who would run operations if their father becomes president, have long dealt with politically connected firms and individuals, an overlap of business and politics unseen in the modern White House\nDonald Trump's adult children have spent a decade doing business with politically connected foreign firms—a role that will present potential conflicts of interest whether he wins on Nov. 8 or continues to pursue politics if he loses.\nThose whom Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump have worked with abroad include: the family of a developer in India who is a ruling-party politician, an Azerbaijani government minister's son and a media company that became the Turkish president's outlet of choice during the July 15 coup attempt.\nNo recent president has had a portfolio of international business interests as extensive as Mr. Trump's—or as great a level of business engagement on his behalf by offspring, who have also played a role in his campaign.\nU.S. law exempts the president and vice president from conflict-of-interest rules that require many federal employees to recuse themselves from decisions involving their financial interests. Presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan voluntarily put most assets in blind trusts. Presidential candidate Mitt Romney said that, if elected, he would have created a federally qualifying blind trust.\nA President Trump \"would not be involved in the business,\" said Trump Organization general counsel Alan Garten. \"His focus obviously would be on the office of the presidency, and Don, Ivanka and Eric would run the company.\" Mr. Trump's campaign referred questions to Mr. Garten. The three Trump children didn't respond to requests for comment sent through the campaign and the company.\nTrump Organization is the umbrella company operating the family's businesses, including real-estate assets and units that manage hotels and condo towers around the world. Much of that is domestic, but its new business in recent years has been heavily overseas—the last 10 new real-estate or real-estate branding deals it has announced are all abroad.\nThat business largely consists of licensing deals, and in some cases management deals, with foreign developers building condo and hotel towers. Clients include wealthy business people and politicians who buy Trump-branded condos. Mr. Trump's adult children have in recent years taken over day-to-day management of much of the business.\nThe filial arrangement would raise questions about potential conflicts of interest in a Trump presidency, especially in dealings abroad, said Aaron Friedberg, a national-security adviser to Dick Cheney when he was vice president.\n\"The fact is that his family is involved in business with a list of players—I don't assume we know them all—in all kinds of places, in many of which the distinction between politics and business is blurry,\" said Mr. Friedberg. \"Anybody you're dealing with in those places that has a lot of money is involved in politics in some way. How can you insulate it?\"\nThis would also likely come up as an issue for Mr. Trump if he stays involved in politics, Mr. Friedberg said. \"It seems to me that a number of questions have been raised that have not been answered,\" he said. \"It's not going to go away.\"\nMr. Friedberg is among former Republican national-security officials who signed a letter stating they wouldn't vote for Mr. Trump because they didn't believe he was qualified from a foreign-policy perspective. Mr. Trump called the signatories \"the failed Washington elite\" and released a list of military leaders who support him.\nThe letter Mr. Friedberg signed didn't mention Mr. Trump's foreign business ties, but he and several other signatories said those ties contributed to their reservations. The Trump children would be doing business with companies that might assume they have unique access to the president, Mr. Friedberg said, and with companies whose interests might differ from the national interests their father would be representing.\nThose potential conflicts are similar to those that have arisen from the Clinton Foundation's foreign donors, said Eric Edelman, who directed Defense Department policy under President George W. Bush and signed the letter opposing Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump and others have called those Clinton Foundation donations a \"pay-for-play\" arrangement, suggesting foreign contributors to the Clinton family charity may have expected to gain access to Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state.\n\"They are slightly different cases,\" said Mr. Edelman, \"but both raise very serious concerns about influence peddling and conflicts of interest.\"\nThe Clinton Foundation, whose donations go into charity work, said it has stopped accepting most foreign donations and would stop taking all such donations if Mrs. Clinton became president. It said her daughter Chelsea Clinton would remain involved with the foundation.\nTrump Organization's Mr. Garten acknowledged that the extent of Mr. Trump's international business connections is unique for a presidential nominee. \"I respect that this is different,\" he said. \"It is a new situation. I don't believe it presents a conflict.\"\nMr. Garten and the Trump campaign didn't respond to subsequent inquiries as to Mr. Trump's plans beyond the presidential race.\nAmong potential conflicts is the Trump company's relationship with Turkey's Dogan Holding, said Mr. Edelman, the former Bush-administration official and onetime ambassador to Turkey. Dogan operates oil companies, a real-estate empire and media properties in Turkey.\nMr. Trump's May 2016 federal disclosure reports income to one of his companies in the range of $1 million to $5 million since the beginning of 2015 from Dogan related to Istanbul towers bearing Mr. Trump's name—a deal involving Ivanka Trump early on, according to a 2012 Trump press release. She and her father visited the tower a day after Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan attended the official opening of its associated mall.\nThe night of the failed coup, Dogan's flagship television network became the venue through which Mr. Erdogan appealed to citizens to oppose the putsch. That was a turnabout for Dogan, whose chairman and other executives this year were charged in Turkey with criminal tax evasion, widely seen as retaliation for a perceived antigovernment slant by Dogan media outlets. A person close to the Dogan family said there has been no wrongdoing.\nSince the failed coup, Dogan's media group has taken on a more pro-government line, including broadcasts supporting Mr. Erdogan's claim that Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen was responsible for the putsch.\nTurkey has asked the U.S. to extradite Mr. Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania and has denied the allegation. The U.S. Justice Department has said it is reviewing that request; privately, many senior U.S. officials have said they are skeptical of Turkey's claims against Mr. Gulen.\nThe next American president will likely inherit that thorny bilateral dispute.\nMr. Garten said the Dogan relationship wouldn't be a problem because the Trump Organization would be separate from Mr. Trump. The person close to Dogan said the company would prefer to remove the Trump name from its buildings based on the candidate's \"anti-Muslim rhetoric.\"\nWhen Donald Trump Jr. sought a few years ago to expand his father's real-estate empire in Latin America, he turned to businessman Camilo Benedetti, brother of a Colombian senator.\nMr. Benedetti took the younger Mr. Trump around Mexico in 2010 and Colombia in 2011, where Mr. Benedetti had relationships with top government officials, Mr. Benedetti said. One meeting was with Colombia's leader at the presidential palace, Casa de Nariсo. \"I asked him as a favor,\" Mr. Benedetti said of the president. The meeting didn't result in any active business developments, said Mr. Benedetti and Mr. Garten.\n\"There's no question that whenever the Trump Organization looks into a project or enters a new market, there is often excitement both from the business sector and maybe even, in some countries, the government,\" Mr. Garten said of the meeting and others like it that the Trump children have had with foreign leaders.\nOne of the newest Trump partners, Indonesian media magnate Hary Tanoesoedibjo, had business ties with family members of Suharto, the country's late dictator. He ran unsuccessfully for vice president in the most-recent national election and formed a political party critical of the current government.\nLast year, Trump Organization announced a deal to manage a Bali resort owned by Mr. Tanoesoedibjo's company, PT Global Mediacom Tbk, and to develop a golf resort in West Java with him. Mr. Trump reported a range of $2 million to $10 million income to his companies from the projects since the beginning of 2015 in his May 2016 federal disclosures. Donald Trump Jr. was involved in the deals, according to news releases announcing them. Mr. Garten declined to comment on the Indonesian project. Mr. Tanoesoedibjo's assistant didn't respond to requests for comment.\nIn Mumbai, India, the Trump Organization has a brand-licensing deal for a condo tower with Lodha Group, whose founder, Mangal Prabhat Lodha, is among India's wealthiest property owners and a member of his state's legislature from India's ruling party.\nMr. Trump's May 2016 federal disclosure shows income to a Trump Organization company of $1 million to $5 million since the beginning of 2015 from the licensing deal. A Lodha spokeswoman said both companies \"work with the highest standards of professionalism and integrity.\" Mr. Garten said that Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr. worked on the project and that he isn't concerned that Mr. Lodha is a politician.\n\"There's a great relationship between Mr. Trump's children and the principals of that project,\" he said. \"I don't see the potential issue.\"\nIn Azerbaijan, Mr. Trump's July 2015 federal disclosure reports that a company owned by Mr. Trump had received $2.5 million in income since the beginning of 2014 in a deal that includes management services for a hotel and condo tower being developed by Anar Mammadov, whose father is the country's transportation minister. Ivanka Trump's website says she oversaw the project \"since its inception.\" Mr. Garten said the project is on hold.\nThe Azerbaijan America Alliance, in a press release, listed Mr. Mammadov as its founder. The group spent $12.6 million between 2011 and 2015 on federal lobbyists to promote Azerbaijan interests in Washington, according to federal filings compiled by Center For Responsive Politics. Calls to the number given on Mr. Mammadov's company website weren't answered. Calls to the Azerbaijan America Alliance's number were answered by a lobbying firm that said it didn't represent the alliance anymore.\n\"It's not unusual for people around the world successful in a business to play some role in government,\" Mr. Garten said of Trump Organization's dealings with politically connected foreign businesses. \"That doesn't mean there's anything wrong or inappropriate.\"", "timestamp": "2016-11-02", "title": "Statement on Trump's Foreign Business Entanglements"}

EDT\nMR. SCHULTZ: Good afternoon. Welcome aboard Air Force One en route to North Carolina. I have one -- I have two scheduling announcements to lead us off, and then I'm happy to take your questions.\nOn Sunday, this Sunday, November 6th, the President will travel to Orlando, Florida to participate in Hillary for America event, and then he'll return to Washington that evening. And on Monday, November 7th, the President will travel to Durham, New Hampshire for a Hillary for America rally. Further details about the President's travel on Monday will be forthcoming in the next couple of days.\nQ: Durham, New Hampshire?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Durham, New Hampshire -- yes.\nAnd with that, I'm happy to take your questions.\nQ: Can we talk about the President's comments about the FBI Director? And can you explain what changed from earlier this week when your immediate supervisor, Josh Earnest, said on a number of occasions that he would neither defend nor criticize Director Comey? And then in this interview, it sounded as though the President was criticizing Director Comey.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Darlene, the short answer to your question is, nothing changed. If you read the full transcript of the President's remarks, you will see that the President went out of his way that he wasn't going to comment on any specific investigation. The President said that a couple of times. He also talked about the importance, though, of adhering to norms and practices that have been in place for a long time. Those norms and practices historically limit public discussion and speculation and, yes, innuendo about facts and materials that are collected in the course of a law enforcement investigation. That's exactly what Josh said on Monday, as well. Josh did say that we would -- we're not going to be in a position to defend or criticize the FBI Director. That is our view.\nBut what is also true, and what Josh said on Monday and what the President reiterated yesterday, is that we do take seriously these longstanding norms and customs that historically limit the sort of public speculation and public discussion of facts and materials that are collected in the context of a law enforcement investigation.\nQ: Is he implicitly criticizing the FBI Director, or is he really cautioning the public not to jump to conclusions on the basis of a fairly cryptic letter that the FBI Director sent to Congress?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Scott, what we have said is we're not going to be in a position to criticize or defend the letter you reference, and I'll explain why. We do know that there's been ample analysis done, including in many of your outlets. But given the constraints we're under, since we're aboard Air Force One, as an official in the White House I can't engage in that speculation.\nWhat I think the President was talking about was the importance of adhering to those norms and practices that have governed the rule of law for a long time now. I'll also say that the President believes these customs shouldn't only apply to someone who's famous or if an election is around the corner, but these are principles worth upholding no matter the circumstances surrounding any particular investigation.\nQ: Eric, walk me through why the President says that -- or when asked if he was upset about the investigation, bring that up. I mean, it's hard to read anything other than an implicit criticism in it, in the same way that if somebody asks, are you upset that Eric was evasive in answering our questions, and I said, well, I certainly would like him to uphold traditions and norms where the Press Secretary answered questions -- it would be a criticism.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Justin, maybe that would be a fair read if the President didn't explicitly say several times that he wasn't going to comment on a specific investigation. So I'd urge you to read the full context, read the full transcript. Maybe that wasn't available to you earlier. But what the President said yesterday is entirely consistent with what Josh said on Monday, which is we're not going to be in a position, given the constraints of where we work, to engage in a lot of the public speculation and discussion that resulted from the letter that Scott referenced that was sent late last week.\nThere has been a lot of analysis in the public space. That's not something that we at the White House have the luxury of engaging in. That's specifically why we said we're not going to criticize or defend the FBI Director's decision to send that letter. And it's precisely why the President believes that we should adhere to those longstanding customs and norms, because they help protect the integrity of investigations.\nQ: So when he said we don't operate on innuendo, who was the \"we\" he was referring to? Who doesn't operate on innuendo? Was he referring to the FBI, the White House, voters shouldn't operate on innuendo? Who was he referring to?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I think he was referring to the idea that in the course of a law enforcement investigation, if facts and materials are released before that investigation comes to a conclusion, or in the middle of it, that that could lead to public speculation and innuendo. And the President believes that, generally speaking, that that doesn't serve our interests.\nQ: Eric, has the President had any contact with anyone in Iowa about the police shootings?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Scott, I appreciate the question. The President is aware of last night's tragic shooting. The President sends thoughts and prayers to the families of the police officers in Iowa. I can tell you the White House has been in touch with local officials on the ground in Des Moines and that the Department of Justice is actively monitoring and has offered any assistance possible as appropriate. I believe the Attorney General made a statement on this before we left.\nI will say the President has said in the past that there's absolutely no justification for committing violence against law enforcement; that these are people who -- that people who attack law enforcement officers are cowards, that they're attacking the brave men and women who risk their lives every day to keep us safe, and that, even broader than this, these are attacks on our rule of law, our civil society, and they have to stop.\nQ: On that, Eric, the President signed a bill last year, the Blue Alert Act, to prevent ambush assaults on police officers. The Justice Department hasn't yet implemented that law a year and a half later. Is the White House concerned about that?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Gregory, I'll have to admit I wasn't tracking if that is a law that's applicable to this particular case. I can tell you that it's my understanding local law enforcement are still gathering facts. Given that this happened last night, I imagine they're going to still be in that mode for a while until they draw some conclusions. But you should check with the Department of Justice on if that law would apply in this case.\nQ: Eric, in the Tom Joyner interview yesterday, the President spelled out pretty stark consequences for his agenda if Donald Trump is elected. Are we going to hear something similar to that today, this afternoon in Chapel Hill?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Scott, I do think you can expect to hear the President make the case today on the importance of this election and voting, either on Tuesday or before. It won't do too much good to vote after. But North Carolina is a state with early vote, and I think he will be urging voters to get to the polls. I think he'll absolutely be making the case for Secretary Clinton, why he believes she is the most qualified nominee to ever run for the presidency; that she has the judgment, character to be the next Commander-in-Chief and to make the complicated decisions that the next person who sits in the *oath of office Oval Office will be confronted with.\nI also think you can expect to hear the President make a contrast with what to expect if Republicans prevail in November. You've got a sitting Republican senator in North Carolina up for election who has suggested an indefinite blockade of any Supreme Court nominee. That would leave the Court with eight justices. Back in 2005, this same Republican senator, Senator Burr, said that would render the Court insignificant. I'll leave it to you, or to him, I guess, to explain what changed between 2005 and 2016.\nOtherwise, the only difference I see is that there's a Democratic President in office. I believe that Senator Burr's comments expose the nonsense of the preexisting Republican argument that Presidents in an election year don't have the right to confirm a Supreme Court justice. You also, by the way, have the number-two Republican in the United States Senate, the Majority Leader Whip, Senator Cornyn, the senior senator from Texas, also suggesting and entertaining an indefinite blockade of any Supreme Court nominees to the bench.\nIf Republicans really think that that's what the American people are yearning for -- more dysfunction, more obstruction, more paralysis -- then they're doing themselves a disservice if they think that spreading the paralysis that has debilitated their own ability to get anything done in Congress -- if they want to spread that paralysis to the third branch of government, we think that's misguided. We think it's a mistake. And we think it's evidence they haven't learned any lessons of the past eight years.\nQ: Eric, can I ask -- sorry. Can I ask about another part of the NowThis interview when the President was talking about the pipeline? He seemed to indicate that the Army Corps was reviewing if the pipeline could be rerouted. I'm wondering if that was an accurate statement or if he misspoke. And if he didn't misspeak, I'm wondering if that's part of the normal sort of easement review process or if that's something special that's happening in this case.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Justin, you spent a lot of time on that interview.\nQ: I read the whole transcript.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Good. I appreciate that. But as you all know, since this was a public announcement, the Army Corps of Engineers issued a pause on the Dakota Access Pipeline construction surrounding the particular area that you're referencing. They are, indeed, reviewing options and redoubling their consultations with the tribe. As they review options, they wanted to go back and reassess their prior consultations with the tribe and communications. I think they're going to process that feedback and then determine the best path forward.\nQ: Do you have any timeline on that -- when that review might be done?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I don't have a new timeline for you. As the President said in the NowThis interview, he is monitoring this closely. He continues to get briefed. But you should check in with the Army Corps of Engineers if they've put a time horizon on this.\nQ: But do you think that it'll be wrapped up before he leaves office?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Ayesha, I don't want to speculate on that. I think you'll get the best guidance if you check in with the Army Corps.\nQ: Also in the Tom Joyner interview, the President talked a little bit about the black vote and how it doesn't appear to be as strong for Hillary Clinton. Why does he think that is? I mean, could some of that be because four years ago, eight years ago he was on the ballot and black voters were excited about that, and he's not on the ballot now? Or is there some larger commentary on Hillary Clinton?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Darlene, I do think the President will address this, too, in his remarks this afternoon in a little bit. But it won't be the first time he's addressed this. As you know, he's often joked that the best way the American people can send off the President and First Lady will be working hard to elect Secretary Clinton. That might be a lighthearted way to talk about the stakes of this election, but he continues to warn against complacency and discuss what's at stake on the ballot on Tuesday. That includes all the progress we've made over the past eight years, which includes the longest stretch of private sector job growth in our nation's history. It means slowing health care costs dramatically. It means the highest graduation rates that we've ever seen. More college enrollment. Rolling back the effects of climate change. An international accord reached to shut off Iran's path to a nuclear weapon. Rejuvenating the auto manufacturing sector. Getting our nation through the housing crisis.\nI'm not listing these things as President Obama's accomplishments. I'm listing these as all items that Republicans are vowing to repeal and to walk back. So yes, I do expect the President to make a very specific pitch to the African American community to turn out, but he's making that pitch universally that there's a lot at stake on Tuesday.\nQ: Eric, can you talk a little bit about why we're spending so much time in Florida and North Carolina? Obviously, the polls are very close there. And if you could also mention why New Hampshire the day before the election.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Ellie, I'm happy to do that. I want to first state, though, that these decisions about where to send the President are calculations made by the Clinton campaign. The President has been clear that he wants to do whatever he can to elect Secretary -- to make sure Secretary Clinton is elected on Tuesday. And so they help develop where would be most valuable to send the President.\nOn North Carolina, as you know, the President was the first Democrat to win that state in a long time, in 2008. In 2012, it was a battleground state. Obviously they had a very successful convention in Charlotte in 2012 for the re-elect. And from what I've read, based on a lot of your accounts, this is a state that is in play for Secretary Clinton in 2016. The President is proud to be there to make the case.\nFlorida -- obviously, the President won that state twice in 2008 and in 2012. And I think that all indications are it's a close race down there. And to go back to Darlene's question, a lot of this is going to be dependent on turnout. And the President wants to make sure that we've left no stone unturned; that all voters know what's at stake, feel energized, and head to the polls.\nNew Hampshire, with their four electoral votes, has also proven consequential in many presidential campaigns. It was a critical state for President Obama's electoral victory in 2008. And I know that it's important to the Clinton campaign. So the President looks forward to making the case up in Durham on Monday.\nQ: They did mean Durham, New Hampshire? They didn't type in Durham and --\nMR. SCHULTZ: Yes, Durham, New Hampshire.\nQ: Eric, the State Department canceled the sale of 26,000 M4 rifles to the Philippines, prompting President Duterte affectionately, I'm sure, to call you guys \"foolish\" and \"monkeys.\" I'm wondering if the halting of that sale was intended as a rebuke of some of his rhetoric lately, or if you could walk us through what the decision-making process was.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Justin, I don't have a tick-tock to share on that decision. You should check in with my colleagues at the State Department. What we've said generally about President Duterte is that he's been using some colorful words lately, but that rhetoric does not reflect the longstanding and historic close relationship we have with the Filipino people. And while some of that rhetoric has been colorful and inflammatory, we haven't received any official requests to change our security, defense, or cooperation with the Philippines.\nQ: And NBC reported that the Russian government is seeking to remove Microsoft products from all of their both government- and state-controlled computers. Without going into sources and methods, do you envision this sort of back-and-forth cyberwar or cyber escalation with Russia having an impact on American businesses? And if so, is the government doing anything to sort of prepare them for the potential loss of business within Russia?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Justin, I haven't seen those reports, so I can't comment on them. I would say, generally speaking, what we have said and what our intelligence community concluded I think two or three weeks ago now is that Russia has been engaged in nefarious cyber activity in order to *influence interfere with the American elections. That is activity that's not unprecedented for them, unfortunately. We've seen that type of attempted interference around the globe on behalf of the Russians.\nWe've also said that the United States, when it comes to cyber activity, has the greatest defensive and offensive capabilities of any country out there. So I don't have any specific comment on that report because I can't even confirm it. But if we have anything to add, I'll get it to you.\nQ: There were reports that Turkey's Erdogan has said that Turkey would create a large safe zone in Syria. I was wondering, does the White House have any response to that?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Ayesha, I did not see President Erdogan's comments before we took off. But our views on this haven't changed. And let me just walk you through our rationale, which is, where we stand right now is that our counter-ISIL campaign has expelled ISIL from an area across north Syria that's about the size of New Jersey. It's about 25 percent of the territory that they previously occupied in Syria. In Iraq, we've expelled them from even more territory -- about 50 percent. But since we don't have a national government we can work with in Syria, the territory from which we've expelled them has been less.\nOur strategy involves working with local partners to secure these areas and prevent ISIL from returning again. So the U.S. military has not recommended deploying U.S. ground forces to defend an area like that, nor do we believe that that's necessary. But instead, we're pursuing a diplomatic approach to try and deescalate the violence. And quite frankly, what we're also calling for is for Russia and the Assad regime to stop their barbaric bombardment inside Syria as soon as possible.\nQ: Is the President going to watch the World Series tonight?\nMR. SCHULTZ: We'll let you know, Ellie. I can tell you that if you happen to be with the President somewhere in Miami, we'll do our best to make sure you can.\nQ: Who is he rooting for?\nMR. SCHULTZ: The Cubs.\nQ: He's a South Sider.\nMR. SCHULTZ: The President has said that his first loyalty is with the White Sox. But given they are not in this series, he's a Chicago fan, and he's rooting for the Cubs.\nQ: Is he concerned about the electoral consequences in Ohio?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Greg, I think what he said yesterday is that if you can take the time to watch the World Series or get a taco from Taco Bell, you can take the time to participate in our elections.\nQ: Thanks, Eric.\nEND 2:18 P.M.

They knew the risks, but they walked out the door because that's who they were. Like law enforcement officers across the country, they were defined by duty, courage, and honor.

[applause]\nThese crowds are terrific. Thank you very much. In six days, we are going to win the great state of Florida. And we are going to win back the White House. That will happen. But you have to get out, you have to vote, we have to get out there. We don't want to blow it.\nThat I can tell you because we have worked very hard, all of us, you, me, everybody. And it's very historic what's happening. I'd like to begin today by thanking all of you for joining me. This has been an incredible journey and we've all done it together. We're almost at the end. [applause]\nBut we're really at the end of the beginning if you think about it. Aren't we? The end of the beginning. Our magnificent history movement has surprised the world and defied expectations at every single turn.\nAnd now, next Tuesday, we will have one last glorious surprise for the pundits, the politicians and the special interests and return the power back to the people. It's going to happen. [applause]\nIt's going to happen. It's been the honor of my life share this journey with you, it has absolutely been. [applause]\nThere are two people, however, who I did not really get to share this with but who are in my thoughts often. And that's my mother and my father, great people. [applause]\nI had great parents. Great parents. I know they're up there watching, I just felt that nice breeze. It's hot, but I just felt that nice breeze [applause]\nSo they're helping us out. And I just want to say thank you to both of them. Special, special people. I've had a great life and now I want to give back to the country that I love. It's time, we have to we have to give back, folks [applause]\nI've seen how the career of politicians, the big donors and the special interests have bled this country dry and stripped our middle class and stripped our companies of its jobs and its wealth. But we're just six days away from delivering justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this country[applause]\nJustice for every child trapped in poverty in the inner cities, for every family that's born—and you know that, they've been born into a situation in some case; they can't get out of it. We're going to get them out of it. We're going to get them out of it.\nWe have endless wars. Every community's hopes and dreams have been shattered and we're not going to let that happen. Our inner cities are going to come back and they're going to come back strong and your going to see what I mean. [applause]\nAnd the African-American community and the Hispanic community are really understanding what's going on and you see that right now. You see that right now in what's happening at the polls.\nWe're winning in Florida, we're winning in Ohio, we're winning in Iowa, in North Carolina. We're doing great in Pennsylvania. A lot of people are saying Pennsylvania's looking very good. So many different places.\nWe just got a poll with three up in Virginia. [applause]\nBut we are seriously up in Florida. That's very important [applause]\nAnd I will never, ever let you down. Real change begins immediately with repealing and replacing Obamacare, a disaster. [applause]\nA disaster. [applause]\nIt is a disaster. It's just been announced that the residents of Florida are going to experience a massive double digit premium hike. [booing]\nI will not tell you what the number is. I know the number very well, but I want you to leave happy. You don't want to hear the number, go home, relax, wake up good and strong tomorrow morning. You'll learn, you're not going to like it.\nIn the great state of Arizona, where we just left, the premiums are going up more than 116 percent. [booing]\nOver 90 percent of the counties in Florida and by the way, in the primaries, I won 66 out of 67 primaries. That's good. [applause]\nI was going to try and exaggerate and say I won them all, but I can't do that. Over 90 percent of the counties in Florida are losing Obamacare insurers next year, they're leaving. They're all leaving.\nIn Minnesota where the premium increase will be close to 60 percent, the Democratic governor has said the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable. Obamacare is a total catastrophe.\nYet Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare, making it even more expensive. [booing]\nI'm asking for your vote so we can replace Obamacare and save healthcare for every family in Florida, so important. [applause]\nReal change also means restoring honesty to our government. [applause]\nAs you know, the FBI has reopened its investigation into crooked Hillary Clinton. [applause]\nHillary wants to blame everyone else for amounting legal troubles and I don't see if you've watched her last few speeches over the last few days. She has become totally unhinged, unbelievable.\nWhat she's saying and what she's doing is actually, it's unbelievable. But she has no one to blame but herself. Hillary is the one who set up the illegal private e-mail server to shield her criminal activity.\nHillary is the one who engaged in a corrupt pay for play scheme at the State Department. Hillary is the one who lied so many times to Congress and to the FBI. Hilary is the one who made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer and who destroyed 33,000 e-mails after, after, after, after receiving a congressional subpoena, think of that. [booing]\nUnbelievable. [booing]\nAnd as you know, they just found—listen to this and I guess you know it, 650,000 e-mails. [booing]\nAnd I would say that classified, confidential, I think they're probably all over the place. I think they're—I think they're gonna find a treasure trough. I can't even imagine.\nIn fact, they said well, this is OK they're duplicates. How could there be duplicates when its many more times what we thought was stolen in the first place, right?\nYou know, when they deleted 33,000 I thought that was a lot. They have 650,000? Hillary is the one who accepted debate questions given to her in advance and used them to cheat. [booing]\nInstead of reporting the breach. That's a big deal. You know, to me that's a big deal. Some people say oh, that's fine, that's a big deal. That's really—that's a real cheater, OK? That's a cheater.\nAnd she was given the questions by a woman that frankly should resigned from the DNC or be fired. [applause]\nBut that's a really big deal. And you notice, they never—the dishonest prospect, the most dishonest. [booing]\nIf you notice, they never go after Hillary. They always talk about Donna Brazile, Donna Brazile didn't do it. But can you imagine if I got—can you imagine, they gave the questions to Donald Trump before a debate. [applause]\nYou know it would be the electric chair. They'd reinstitute the electric chair. No.\nIt'd be headlines all over the world. This isn't headlines.\nI bring it up; it's brought up a little bit. But this isn't like a big deal. She got the debate questions and answers.\nBut she got the debate questions prior to a debate. Now, Bernie Sanders should be angry right? Shouldn't he be angry?\nNow, I'll tell you what. The system is rigged. The system is rigged.\nI've been saying it for a—it's rigged, and we're gonna straighten it out. But the system is rigged. Hillary is not the victim; the American people are the victims of this system. [applause]\nSo corrupt in so many ways. And this is your one chance to change it because you know what?\nIn four years, not gonna happen. There's no way. The numbers won't work.\nIn four years, there's no way. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency. And if she were to be elected, it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis.\nI mean before you go into phase two—let's call what happened on Friday phase two. Phase one, she's so guilty. She shouldn't be allowed to run for the presidency.\nThat's why I say the system is rigged. She shouldn't be allowed to run. But I have a feeling in the 650,000 e-mails, they're gonna find things that you will not even believe.\nWho knows. 650,000 e-mails. No wonder she can't do anything.\nNo, no. How do you work? How do you do it?\n650,000. They'll have to explain that to us some day.\nBut they'll have some things in there that I can just imagine are going to be unbelievable. Hillary's likely to be under investigation for many years. Probably concluding in a criminal trial.\nOut today, WikiLeaks just came out with a new one. Just a little while ago. It's just been shown that a rigged system with more collusion, possibly illegal between the Department of Justice, the Clinton campaign, and the State Department.\nYou saw that. The e-mails show that the Assistant Attorney General who's involved in the investigation has been feeding information directly to John Podesta and the Clinton campaign. Can you believe this? [booing]\nShe shouldn't be allowed to run.\nBy the way, behind me, the great Johnny Damon. The curse of the Yankees, but ultimately he helped the Yankees. Johnny Damon.\nStand up Johnny. [applause]\nNow, I'll tell ya. George Steinbrenner was a good friend of mine. Oh, he didn't like Johnny too much.\nThen he ultimately signed him and then he was fine. He did great.\nBut Johnny Damon was a champ. He was a winner. And he loves this area, you know that. My contract with the American voter begins with a tough ethics reform, and it ends—I'll tell you what. We are going to end—we have no choice.\nWe really have no choice—government corruption. It's going to end. [applause]\nI want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words we all will say right now when we win on November 8. We are going to Washington, D.C. and we are going to drain the swamp. [applause]\nAt the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs. Florida has lost one in four of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton with the support of crooked Hillary. [booing]\nAmerica has lost—this is so hard to believe—70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization.\nAnother Bill and Hillary backed disaster. We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. A Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America, and we will stop the jobs from leaving Florida. They're leaving. We're going to stop it\nAnd you have an excellent governor, by the way. He's fighting hard for you folks. I don't know—I don't know. All I can tell you is he is a worker, he is a worker, and he's fighting very hard. The theft of American prosperity will end and it'll end, I'll tell you. We are—it is being stolen from us folks.\nIt is—we have a one-way highway right into Mexico, right into other countries. And we're going to stop it. From now on, it's going to be America first. [applause]\nAmerica first. [applause]\nIt's going to be America first. [applause]\nA Trump administration will renegotiate NAFTA and we will stand up to foreign product dumping, currency manipulation, and all of the unfair subsidy behaviors. It's horrible what's happening to us. Our politicians don't have a clue, they don't know what they're doing—or other things, OK. We will also immediately stop the job killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. As part of our plan to bring back jobs, we're going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent. We're the highest taxed nation in the world. Killing our jobs. Our companies are leaving. Killing our jobs.\nWe will become a rich nation once again. But to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation. In Orlando, the murder rate doubled, you know that? Doubled last year. Can you believe it? We will support our police, and I met you police of Orlando, they are unbelievable people and they've been through a lot.\nI met the police and these are unbelievable people. We will bring this crime wave to an end. We will also keep our community safe from terrorism. Just a short time ago, Orlando was the victim of the worst mass shooting in American history during the Islamic terror attack on The Pulse nightclub.\nIt was also the worst attack on the LGBTQ community in our country's history. Can't let it happen, can't let it happen. Hillary wants to increase by 550 percent Syrian refugees pouring into our country. [booing]\nHer plan would mean generations of terrorism, radicalism, and extremism spreading in your schools and throughout your communities.\nWhen I'm elected president, we will suspend the Syrian refuge program. [applause]\nAnd we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of your community. [applause]\nGot to keep them out. And we'll build safe zones in Syria. We have to help the people. We're going to build safe zones, but the Gulf States haven't been doing their thing.\nAnd believe me, they have plenty of money. They'll help us, they'll fund it, I'm sure they'll be thrilled. They're going to be funding it, and that will be OK. We want to help people. But we have enough problems in this country. We don't need Orlando and problems. We don't need what happened in San Bernadino.\nWe don't need what's happening in Paris, in Nice and in Germany—which is a disaster. We don't need it. We have enough problems right now, do we agree? We have enough problems. We don't need it. A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. [applause]\nAnd yes, we will build a great wall. [applause]\nWe received the first ever endorsement from our ICE and border patrol officers, great people. The officers that warned that Hillary's plan is the most quote, radical immigration proposal in United States history, and that it will lead to the loss of thousands and thousands of lives, quote.\nAs Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of the most dangerous and violent criminal aliens to go free because their home countries were intelligent, they wouldn't take them back.\nWe bring them to their countries—murderers, drug dealers, gang members, we'd bring them to their countries and their countries would say: get them out, we're not taking them back. They call up the State Department, and the State Department under Hillary Clinton would say: oh, bring them back, we don't want to make waves.\nI guarantee you, whether it's four years or eight years, that will not happen once under a Trump administration. [applause]\nHillary wants totally open borders and strongly supports sanctuary cities. Like San Francisco, where Kate Steinle—incredible young woman—was murdered by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times.\nA Trump administration will cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities immediately. We will end illegal immigration, deport all criminal aliens—the ones we just spoke about—and we will save American lives. We will also repeal Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our very badly depleted military. [applause]\nThat includes major new investments in resources from Pensacola Naval Air Station at MacDill Air Force Base. Have you ever heard of those places? Pretty good places. A lot of people here, lot of people. I'm honored to have the endorsement of 200—more than that now, much more than that—top Admirals and Generals and 22 Medal of Honor recipients.\nGreat people, I've met so many of them, they're incredible. Incredible people. Our new foreign policy will put America first. Hillary and our failed Washington establishment have spend $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East that we never won and that never end. And it's now in worse shape than ever before.\nThe Middle East is a catastrophe, it's far worse off than had we spent nothing.\nThey've dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe. They've left our borders wide open at home. And they've shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries. And it's—it's disappearing. Our country, in a certain sense, is disappearing. Prosperity—real prosperity is disappearing. We owe $20 trillion. Our trade deals, we lose $800 billion a year on trade. We have trade deficits. Think of that. Who negotiates these deals?\nYou know who does? Stupid people. Stupid people. [applause]\nWith very stupid leadership. Who, by the way, they campaign all the time. He's campaigning right now for crooked Hillary. [booing]\nWhy is he campaigning? She's under federal investigation, and we've got a president campaigning for her. And that's all he does is campaign. He ought to be working on your jobs that are leaving and going to Mexico. And your military. [applause]\nI'll tell you what, first of all, she's got bigger problems. But four more years of Obama, we can't take it, folks. Four more years of ISIS, that's what it is. Four more years of no jobs.\nNow, she wants to start a shooting war in Syria and conflict with a nuclear-armed Russia that could very well lead to World War III. Russia is heavily armed, doesn't like her. Putin does not respect her, doesn't like her. What are we doing, folks? She's a mess.\nTo all Americans, I say it's time for new leadership. [applause]\nJust think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of a Trump administration. [applause]\nThank you. It's so beautiful over there. I just noticed the water. Let's go in for a swim. It's about 200 degrees out there.\nAnybody want to go swimming? Let's go. [applause]\nWe are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan. And Hillary wants to increase your taxes by a tremendous amount. You know, we're already the highest-taxed nation in the world. She wants to increase your taxes, if you can believe that one.\nWe're going to eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation. Killing your companies. Killing them. One of the reasons they're leaving. Cancel every illegal Obama executive order. [applause]\nWe're going to rebuild our military and take care of our great, great veterans. They're not being taken care of. You know that. A lot of veterans here. We're going to take care of our veterans finally. They have been mistreated for many, many years.\nWe're going to support the men and women of law enforcement. [applause]\nWe will save the Second Amendment which is, as you know, under tremendous siege. [applause]\nWe will appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. [applause]\nWe will show the world that there is no challenge too great, no dream outside of our reach. There's no dream—no dream outside of our reach. We have all these people telling us what to do. Politicians—they know nothing. I've dealt with them all my life, folks. All talk, no action.\nI have some friends that are politicians. So let me just say there's some good ones. OK? There are some good.\nI'll tell you what, you take a look at the media. These are the most dishonest people anywhere. [booing]\nThese are the most—they—the media—the media is a part and one of the vital cogs in the rigged system under which we live. They're a big fat cog in the—and they never show the crowds. They never show what's happening.\nBut you know what? You hear—when you hear 20,000, sometimes 30,000, when you hear people, sounds like you're at an Ohio State football game. [applause]\nBut they never show it. They never show it. [applause]\nThey never show it.\nPeople of Florida, we love you. All we have to do is cut our ties with these failed politicians of the past. Hillary is a candidate of yesterday. We are the movement of the future. We are. [applause]\nWe're asking for the votes of Republicans, Democrats, independents and first-time voters, of which we're finding out there are many. You probably heard over the last couple of weeks \"Texas is in play\"; \"Texas—that Georgia is in play.\" And I'm saying, \"Gee, that's too bad.\"\nLet me tell you, they're setting records in Texas, and they're voting for Trump, just so you understand that. [applause]\nAnd they know it. [applause]\nBut when they see those numbers coming, they don't want to announce them. But we are winning almost everywhere. I think—give us two more days, I think we're going to be winning everywhere. [applause]\nAnd I'm almost starting to think that the least important problem that Hillary has is the fact that we're winning. I think she's got perhaps bigger problems than even that. [applause]\nWe're fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and nor Hillary's special interests. [applause]\nWe are fighting to unlock the potential of every American community and every American family who hope and pray and yearn for a much better future. [applause]\nI am asking you to dream big—I got to dream big. Because with your vote, we are just—can you believe this?—six days away. Think of that. [applause]\nFrom the change you've been waiting for your entire life. [applause]\nWe're going to work together. We're going to vote. You're going to vote now or you're going to vote by the 8th. But you're going to vote.\nThank you. I love that guy. He's a tough guy, but he just screamed out, \"You're going to win.\" We're going to win. Thank you, man. Thank you. [applause]\nWe have great, great love.\nYou know, we're in a divided nation. We are a divided nation. We're not going to be divided. We're going to have such love in this country. We're going to have such love and such respect.\nTogether, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. [applause]\nWe will make America safe again. [applause]\nAnd we will make America great again. [applause]\nThank you very much. Thank you, folks. God bless you, everybody. God bless you. [applause]\nThank you. Get out and vote. Get out and vote. Thank you. [applause]", "timestamp": "2016-11-02", "title": "Remarks at the Central Florida Fairgrounds in Orlando, Florida"}

[applause]\nI love that sign, \"Blacks for Trump.\" I love that sign, thank you. [applause]\nThere are a lot of those signs.

In six days, we are going to win the great state of Florida and we are going to win back the White House 100 percent. [applause]\nWe're on the cusp of an incredible historic change that transfers power from a failed political establishment and returns that power to our families, communities and citizens, to you.\nThe system is rigged, remember that. The system is rigged. Right now it's rigged. We're going to change it.\nThere's some breaking news about that subject that we're going to discuss right now. As I mentioned yesterday, on of the—and you probably saw this and maybe some of you have just read it.one of the top Department of Justice officials involved in the e-mail investigation, Assistant Attorney General Peter Kassig [booing]\nis a close associate of John Podesta. The two met for dinner after Clinton testified about Benghazi and Podesta, who by the way said Hillary Clinton has terrible instincts on WikiLeaks, described him as the man who kept him, Podesta, out of jail.\nKadzik is also the one who helped lead the effort to confirm Attorney General Loretta Lynch. Now, today, in a newly released e- mail—through WikiLeaks again—we learned that Kadzik was feeding information about the investigation into the Clinton campaign and that [booing]\nright? And that Kadzik said quote \"It will be a while before the State Department posts the e-mails.\" Remember they were waiting for the e-mails. [booing]\nPodesta forwarded the e-mails to Clinton's top staff and said, additional chances for mischief. These are the people that want to run our country, folks. [booing]\nThe spread of political agendas into the Justice Department—there's never been a thing like this that has happened in our country's history—is one of the saddest things that has happened to our country. But with your vote you can beat the system, the rigged system, and deliver justice. So, show up early and vote. Show up early. You know, the lines are incredible. The polls are all saying we're going to win Florida. Don't believe it. Don't believe it. Get out there and vote. Pretend we're slightly behind. You got to get—we don't want to blow this.\nThis is the one chance we have, it'll never happen again. It's not going to happen. In four years, it's not going to happen—it can't happen again. This is a movement like we have never seen in this country before. These crowds, the enthusiasm, the love. [applause]\nGot to get out and vote. Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare. [applause]\nAnd Hillary is not going to be the answer because she wants to make it more expensive. She's doubling down. It's just been announced that the residents of Florida—sorry to tell you this, folks—are going to experience a massive, massive double digit premium hike. [booing]\nNow, I know what that hike is, but I want you to leave here happy, I want you to be happy people. I want you to think about the future after we take back the White House so I'm not going to tell you what your hike is, but let me just say it's going to be very substantial. And Obamacare doesn't work on top of everything else. As an example, in the great state of Arizona—which I just left—premiums are going up more than 116 percent. It's out of control.\nOver 90 percent of the counties in Florida are losing Obamacare insurance next year. Lots of luck in your negotiation. In Minnesota where the premium increase will be close to 60 percent, the Democratic governor said, the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable. Premiums are surging, companies are leaving, insurers are fleeing, doctors are quitting and deductibles are absolutely through the roof. Wasn't supposed to be like this, but I said it was going to be like this before it was passed because I understand how business works.\nObamacare never had a chance. It's a catastrophe. Yet Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare making it even more expensive. It's going to go up a lot. People aren't going to be able to afford it so I'm not sure that it matters, they're just not going to be able to pay. I'm asking for your vote so we can replace Obamacare and save health care for every family in Florida and the United States. [applause]\nReal change also means restoring honesty to our government. As you know, the FBI has—did you hear about this little event? The FBI re-opening the investigation. [applause]\nThey're re-opening the investigation into Crooked Hillary Clinton. [booing]\nCrooked Hillary, she's crooked. [booing]\nLock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!\nShe is a crooked one, there's no question. Crooked Hillary Clinton, you know that term has really stuck, everyone's calling her—has anyone seen Crooked Hillary Clinton today? [applause]\nThat's going to be a great term for a president, right? Boy, oh boy, what a mess. This is the biggest scandal since Watergate. And now it's been reported that there are FBI inquiries probing virtually all of Hillary Clinton's inner circle and many of the things she's done over the years. It's about time. Remember, it's a rigged system, remember it's about time.\nShe wants to blame everyone else for her mounting legal troubles, but she really has no one to blame but herself. Hillary is the one who set up the illegal private e-mail server to shield her criminal activity. The woman screaming exactly, exactly, it is exactly. Hillary is the one who engaged in a corrupt pay-for-play scheme at the State Department and who ripped off the people of Haiti, the people of Haiti were ripped off. [booing]\nAnd I met with the people of Little Haiti. Anybody here?\nThese are great people, great, thank you.\nHillary is the one who endangered national security by sending classified information on an insecure server. Hillary is the one who lied so many times to Congress and the FBI. Hillary is the one who made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer. [booing]\nAnd she's the one who destroyed 33,000 e-mails after receiving a Congressional subpoena. [booing]\nShe also accepted debate questions given to her in advance by Donna Brazile [booing]\nand then used those debate questions to cheat. It's cheating, the worst level. Instead of reporting this breach to an ethics committee or whoever would listen to the breach. So she got the answers, cheating. She got the questions, cheating. And then she—rather than reporting them, rather than saying this shouldn't be happening—she used them against Bernie Sanders.\nCan you imagine. she probably got them against me too except we won the debate so easy I don't think it mattered. We won those debates. [applause]\nDid you see her at the end of the debates? Folks, she was exhausted. You know what she did? She immediately went home and went to sleep. [applause]\nHillary is not the victim, and the American people, frankly, are the victims of this rigged and corrupt system in every way. But this is your chance finally to change it, November 8th. Now in Florida's case, earlier. Now, just so you understand, record turnout, unbelievable numbers, unbelievable. We're doing great with the African-American community. [applause]\nWe're doing great with the Hispanic community. [applause]\nAnd the lines are four, five and six blocks long. They've never seen anything like it. And the polls have just come up. We're way up in Florida. I shouldn't say that, because I want you to go vote. [applause]\nOK, ready? We're going to pretend we're down. We're down. Pretend, right? We'll pretend we're down. No, we got to win. We got to win big. We got to beat her. Got to beat her. We're up in Ohio, we're up in Iowa, we're up in North Carolina. [applause]\nI think we're doing great in Pennsylvania; from what I hear. [applause]\nFolks, you're going to be so proud. You're going to be so proud. We're going to make America great again. You're going to be so happy and you're going to be so proud of your country again.\nIf Hillary Clinton were to be elected, it would create an unprecedented and protracted constitutional crisis. [booing]\nHaven't we just been through a lot with the Clintons, right? Remember when he was impeached for lying? He can't practice law. He doesn't have the right to practice law. Didn't we just go through this? And the last thing we need is another four years of Obama. That's the last thing. [booing]\nAnd this will be worse. That means ISIS, that means high taxes, that means bad health care, that means no border. Without a border, we don't have a country. The work of government would grind to a halt if she were ever elected. She'll be in court for her entire tenure and she'll be convicted. Because look, the first time—I mean, frankly, forget about this time. The first time she gets a subpoena from the United States Congress and she deletes everything? There shouldn't have been a second time.\nBut I have respect that the FBI has given it a second chance. And this time, I have no doubt that in that 650,000 e-mails—did you see where they said, oh, we're not worried. They're duplicates. How can there be duplicates if there are hundreds of thousands more than you started off with? [booing]\nSo today, I guess WikiLeaks, it sounds like, is going to be dropping some more, and if we met tomorrow, I'll tell you about it tomorrow, but one beauty that's been caught was, and this was just recently, newly released, where they say having a dump. We're having a dump of all of those e-mails.\nIn another communication, Bill Clinton's chief of staff says foreign government—right, this should be another one. Just like swamp—you know the swamp little statement—this one, this one. Do you remember what it is? Right? All the money is in, right? They said all the money is in. They're talking about foreign money pouring into their pockets. They said all the money is in. [booing]\nThis is what is running for office. Honestly, she should be ashamed of herself. She should be ashamed of herself.\nMy contract with the American voter begins with a plan to restore honesty to our government. That includes a ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections. Makes sense. I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words we all will be saying right now. When we win on November 8th, we are going to Washington, D.C. and we are going to drain the swamp. [applause]\nGonna drain the swamp. We're gonna drain the swamp, folks. We're gonna drain that swamp. [applause]\nAnother important issue for Americans is integrity in journalism. These people are among the most dishonest people I've ever met, spoken to, done business with. These are the most dishonest people. [booing]\nThere has never been dishonesty—there has never been dishonesty like we've seen in this election. There's never been anywhere near the media dishonesty like we've seen in this election. Don't worry, they won't spin the cameras and show the kind of massive crowds. They won't do that. [booing]\nThe very talented Michael Goodwin of the New York Post just wrote today that 2016 presidential race will mark the low-water mark of journalism that is worthy—think of it—of the First Amendment. Never before have so many media organizations, old and new, abandoned all pretense of fairness to take sides and try to pick a president. [booing]\nIt's unbelievable. It's un-honest.\nFor instance, we have a great story. We give it out to the media. They'll make it look as bad as possible—as bad as possible. Parenthetically\nSo sad. Parenthetically and very sadly, earnings for the New York Times are down 97 percent this year. They just announced that. So bad. I feel so badly for them. Just announced—97 percent. Oh, they're doing great. And then they tell you who to vote for, you know? Who to vote for. They want crooked Hillary.\nThis isn't about me; it's about all of you and our magnificent movement to make America great again all over this country. And they're talking about it all over the world.\nAt the core of my contract is my plan to bring back jobs. [applause]\nRight now, 70 million American women and children live in poverty or near the brink of poverty. Forty-three percent of African- American school-aged children live in poverty. Thirty-two percent of Hispanic school-aged children live in poverty.\nThis is America, this is the United States, this is unacceptable. As your president, I will go into the poorest communities and work on a national plan for revitalization. [applause]\nWe will replace decades of failure with generations of success. Florida has lost one in four of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary. [booing]\nAnd here's a number that you should remember because it's not even a believable number, and it's correct. America has lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization. Another Bill and Hillary-backed disaster.\nWe are living through the greatest jobs left in the history of the world. Our jobs are going to Mexico, our jobs are going to other countries. China and others are making our product. We don't make it anymore. A Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America and we will stop the jobs from leaving Florida. [applause]\nMy second home, you know that, I'm here all the time. My second home, great place.\nThe theft of American prosperity will end. So they are stealing our prosperity, horribly stealing our prosperity. A Trump administration will renegotiate NAFTA and we'll stand up to foreign product dumping all over the place. [applause]\nCurrency manipulation by China and many other countries and all of the unfair subsidy behavior that's going on all over the world against us. We will also immediately stop the job-killing, Trans- Pacific Partnership, a disaster. [applause]\nAnd Hillary wants it to happen, she called it the gold standard, then she rejected it. But she's going to approve it. Then she lied during the debate, right? She lied. [booing]\nShe lied during the debate. She said she never called it the gold standard, she lied. And she lied about the line in the sand, right? She lied. As part of our plan to bring back jobs, we're going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent. [applause]\nWe will also cancel billions in global warming payments to the United Nations [applause]\nand use that money to support America's vital environmental infrastructure and natural resources. We're spending hundreds of billions of dollars. We don't even know who's doing what with the money. We're gonna spend the money here. We're gonna work on our own environment. [applause]\nThat includes repairing the Herbert Hoover Dike at Lake Okeechobee and protecting the Florida Everglades. [applause]\nWe will become a rich nation again, but to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation [applause]\nA terrible tragedy today has occurred in Iowa. You read, you saw. Early this morning, two Iowa police officers, outstanding, outstanding people, were murdered, ambushed, ambushed violently while sitting in their squad cars. We send our thoughts and prayers to the family of the fallen. I just left Iowa, most beautiful place. The treatment was so incredible, the crowds, the police officers were so incredible the job they did. Now two of them are dead. An attack on our police is an attack on all of us. [applause]\nLaw enforcement is the line separating civilization from total chaos, you have to remember that. [applause]\nAccording to the national law enforcement officers, Memorial Fund, firearm related police were up 48 percent this year, the highest they've ever been. And there have been 14 ambush style attacks this year alone, never had anything like this.\nAnd what it is, is a lack of respect for our nation, it's a lack of respect for our leadership. To all the great men and women of law enforcement I want you to know, we're with you, we support you and we will stand by you. [applause]\nWe will restore law order and justice in America—justice. [applause]\nThank you. Thank you, so good luck to the people of Iowa.\nWe will also work with our federal and local law enforcements to keep America safe from terrorism. [applause]\nHillary Clinton wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees pouring into our countries. [booing]\nHer plan would mean generations of terrorism and extremism spreading in your schools and all throughout your communities. When I'm president, we will suspend the Syrian refugee program[applause]\nand we will keep radical Islamic terrorist the hell out of your community. [applause]\nNow, we all have heart and we're gonna build safe zones and we're gonna have some of the Gulf States that have nothing but money, they'll put up the money, we'll lead it, we'll build safe zones.\nBut we have enough problems in our country. She wants to increase the thousands and thousands that are pouring in right now. She wants to increase that number by 550 percent.\nAnd then, you wonder why Podesta says, she has bad instincts and you wonder why Bernie Sanders says, she's got bad judgment, they're right. She's got bad judgment, personally I think she's a very unstable person, if you wanna really know the truth. [applause]\nAnd we're gonna repeal and replace Obamacare, but you wanna know something? Honestly, I think for herself she's got much bigger problems right now than Obamacare. She's got bigger problems. [applause]\nLet's see what's on all those e-mails that they just found, see what's on those e-mails.\nThank you.\nIt's too bad those cameras aren't turning around to see this incredible group of people with thousands more outside, isn't it too bad? [applause]\nThey don't do it. But you know, if Hillary speaks and there's 30 people in the line they say, the crowd is massive. [booing]\nShe's never had a crowd like this in her life. [applause]\nPresident Obama shouldn't be campaigning for any longer, it's really a conflict, right? He oughta be working on jobs, on the border, on building up our military instead of campaigning for crooked Hillary Clinton, is what he oughta be doing. [applause]\nHe's in North Carolina, but we're going to North Carolina right after this, so. [applause]\nBut we have a few more today in Florida, and we have massive crowds. There's something happening. They're not reporting it. Katie, you're not reporting it, Katie. [applause]\nBut there's something happening, Katie. There's something happening, Katie. A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. And yes, we will build the wall. [applause]\nThank you. [applause]\nWe've received the first ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers. First time they've ever endorsed a presidential candidate. [applause]\nThey tell us the border crisis taking place right now is the worst it's ever been. Now, in all fairness, people probably figure that I'm going to win. [applause]\nSo, they're racing across the border. I don't know. I'm sorry to do this to you, folks. [applause]\nHillary has pledged totally open borders, meaning you don't have a country anymore. And she strongly supports sanctuary cities like in San Francisco where[booing]\nRight? Where Kate Steinle was killed by a five time deported illegal immigrant. [booing]\nThe immigration officers warn that Hillary's plan is the most radical immigration proposal in U.S. history and that it will lead to the loss of thousands of lives. And I believe that. As secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of the most dangerous and violent criminal aliens to go free because their countries would not take them back. [booing]\nCountless innocent Americans have been killed by illegal immigrants. Last year, as an example, 17-year-old Starlett Pitts, her boyfriend and her mother were stabbed to death in their Lee High Acres home by an illegal immigrant. The killer had been convicted of assaulting a police officer and was wanted for double murder and robbery. And the people that knew him were begging that he be incarcerated. They were begging. He was released from custody pending his court appearance, enabling him to commit murder.\nA Trump administration will stop illegal immigration, deport all criminal aliens and save American lives. [applause]\nAnd I want to thank, by the way, I see all these signs—\"Cubans for Trump.\" Cubans. I love Cubans. [applause]\nSo they gave me last week the Bay of Pigs Association, right? You know. They gave me their award last week and it was a great honor. And we're gonna fight very hard for the Cubans and we're gonna fight very, very hard for the Hispanics because they have not been properly taken care of.\nWhat's happened with the Hispanic population in our country is not right. What's happened with the inner cities of our country, the African-American community, the Hispanic community, is very, very unfair. [applause]\nThank you. Thank you.\nWe're going to take care of it. The crime is horrible, the education is terrible, and you can't get a job. We're going to fix the inner cities—we're going to fix the inner cities.\nThank you, fellows, that's so good. Blacks for Trump. That's so nice.\nWe will also repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military. [applause]\nThat includes total support for homestead air reserve base. A Trump administration will stand in solidarity with the suffering people of Cuba and Venezuela all surrounding Dural—all surrounding Dural against the oppression of the Castro and Maduro regimes, you know what I'm talking about.\nWe will cancel Obama's one-sided Cuban deal made by Executive Order. If we do not get the deal we want, and the deal that people living in Cuba and here deserve[applause]\nincluding protecting religious and political freedom, right? I'm honored to have the endorsement of over 200 top admirals and generals, and 22 Medal of Honor recipients. [applause]\nYou know it's really called peace through strength. Peace through strength, that's what we're going to have, well, hopefully. Have to get rid of ISIS—we're going to get rid of ISIS, don't worry, we're getting rid of ISIS. But we have to get to rebuild our country.\nWe've spent six trillion dollars in the Middle East—six trillion dollars. And it's in far worse shape, by a factor of 10, from when we started. Six trillion—we lost lives, the most incredible, great people.\nOur new foreign policy will put America first. Hillary brought disaster to Iraq and Syria and Libya. And she empowered Iran, remember, she's got bad judgment. And she unleashed ISIS, came right out of the vacuum. Now she wants to start a shooting war in Syria in conflict with nuclear-armed Russia. Frankly, it could lead to World War III and she has no sense. She's got no instinct, but that's decided\nHillary and our failed Washington establishment, they've spent that six trillion dollars. I mean, I'd love to have that money back, but I'd much rather have all those lives back—rather have all those lives. [applause]\nLove to have those lives back. But the Middle East is in bad shape folks, and it's getting worse, totally getting worse. They've dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe. They've left our borders wide open at home and they've shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries. And these are foreign wars that we don't win—we don't win. We don't win anymore, we don't win with trade, we don't win with wars, we don't win anymore. We're going to start winning again, you watch. We're going to start. [applause]\nTo all Americans I say it's time for new leadership. Just think about what can be accomplished in the first 100 days of a Trump administration. We're going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan. [applause]\nAnd she is going to raise your taxes very substantially, I think you know that. [booing]\nWe will eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation, cancel every illegal Obama executive order, rebuild our military and take care of our great veterans. [applause]\nProvide school choice and put an end to Common Core; we're bringing our education local. [applause]\nSupport the men and women of law enforcement. [applause]\nWe're going to save our Second Amendment, which is under siege [applause]\nand appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. [applause]\nClinton wants us to think small, wants us to believe things can't change and wants our lives to revolve around Washington. I wonder if she's going to be there much longer. What do you think? [booing]\nI don't think so. I don't know. I'm not sure she's going to be there. But she wants—she wants our lives to revolve around Washington, D.C. I'm asking you to dream big, to push for bold change and to believe in a movement powered by the people and by their love for this great country. [applause]\nI'm tired of politicians telling Americans to defer their dreams to another day when they really mean another decade. America is tired of waiting. The moment is now. All we have to do is stop believing in our failed politicians and start believing in each other and in our country. [applause]\nThere is no challenge too great, no dream outside of our reach. Don't let anyone tell you it can't be done. The future lies with the dreamers, not the cynics, not the critics, certainly not the media. [booing]\nHillary has been there for 30 years and she has accomplished nothing. She's just made things worse. Look at her record. She's the candidate of yesterday; we are the—right? Is that right?\nWe are the movement of the future. Our movement represents all Americans from all backgrounds and all walks of life. We are asking for the votes of Republicans and Democrats and independents and first time voters. And believe me, there are a lot of first time voters that are standing on line right now. [applause]\nWe're asking for the vote of every American who believes truth and justice, not money and power, should rule the day. And I understand the other side very well. I've been there for a long time, but I love our country and I understand what has to be done. We are going in the wrong direction, and if we keep going in this direction, we won't have a country any longer. [booing]\nWe're fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests. We're fighting to unlock the potential of every American community and every American family who hope and pray and yearn for a better future.\nWith your vote, we are just—think of it—six days away. [applause]\nThis started on June 16th of last year. It's a long time. Seems like a long time ago. But we're six days away from the change you've been waiting for your entire life. It'll never happen again. It'll never, ever happen. It's not going to happen in four years. When I see Cubans for Trump, it'll never happen again. I'm telling you. This whole thing will never happen again.\nThere's never been a movement like this in the history of our country—there's never been a movement like this.\nThank you. Thank you.\nThere has never been a movement like this in the history of our country—it's never happened. Even the pundits, even the ones that truly dislike Donald Trump have said, it's the single greatest phenomena the have ever seen. We have to close the deal. We have to close—get out and vote. November 8th fine, better if you vote now.\nMaybe you don't feel good November 8th, you don't want to get outta bed, you gotta get up, you gotta vote.\nTogether we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "The President spoke at 3:44 p.m. on the Michael Hooker Fields at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In his remarks, he referred to Isabel Trumbull, student, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Ghazala Khan, mother of Capt. Humayun Khan, USA, who was killed in Iraq on June 8, 2004; Sen. Marco A. Rubio; Sen. John S. McCain III and former Gov. W. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, in their respective capacities as the 2008 and 2012 Republican Presidential nominees; Supreme Court Associate Justice-designate Merrick B. Garland; and Judge Diana Gribbon Motz, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. He also referred to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) terrorist organization.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119599", "text": "The President. Hello, North Carolina! Hello, Tar Heels! Are you fired up? [Applause] Are you ready to go?\nAudience members. Yes!\nThe President. It is good to be back in Chapel Hill. I love me some North Carolina. I do. I've said this before. I love North Carolina. I love the State. I love the people. I love the basketball. I mean, I—you know, I always say that North Carolina, that's one place where even the people who don't vote for me are nice. [Laughter] It's true. Just good people. Just good people.\nAnd we've got a beautiful summer day in November. [Laughter] I know you guys are a little hot, so make sure everybody kind of bends their knees. Don't stand up too stiff. If anybody faints, just give them a little room. They'll be okay. Hydrate. I don't mean to sound like your mom or your dad, but—[laughter].\nSo can everybody please give Isabel a big round of applause for the wonderful introduction? We have a couple of outstanding Members of Congress here. G.K. Butterfield is here. And David Price is here. One of the finest public servants in North Carolina history, your former Governor, Jim Hunt, is in the house. Your current attorney general and your next Governor, Roy Cooper, is here. And your next United States Senator, Deborah Ross, is here. So—and you're here too. [Laughter] Somebody hollered, what about me? It's, like, you guys are here too. And I'm going to talk about you and how much this country is going to depend on you over these next few days.\nI want to thank all the organizers who are here. I know you've helped rally tens of thousands of volunteers and registered more than 100,000 voters right here in North Carolina. And it is that grassroots work that led us to win North Carolina in 2008. And you are why we will win North Carolina in 2016.\nAnd we've got 6 days—6 days.\nAudience member. Love you, Obama!\nThe President. I love you too. But I've got some business I've got to do here. [Laughter] Huh? I'll give you a hug on the way out. But right now we've got to focus on some \"bidness.\" Not business, but \"bidness.\" We've got 6 days, 6 days to decide the future of this country that we love. And the good news is, you don't have to wait until election day to do the right thing. You can vote right now. If you're not registered, you have until Saturday to register and vote at any one-stop location in your county. If you don't know where to go, then go to iwillvote.com—iwillvote.com. You can find the one-stop location near you, and we can finish what we started 8 years ago.\nNow, some of you, 8 years ago, were 10. You know who you are. So you may not remember exactly where we were as a country when I visited Raleigh in the final days of the 2008 campaign. We were living through two long wars; we were in the early days of the worst economic crisis in 80 years. People had lost their homes, their jobs. Their 401(k)s had crashed. Their home values were sinking.\nAudience member. You fixed it!\nThe President. [Laughter] The economy was teetering on the edge of a Great Depression.\nBut we turned the page. We've seen America battle back. Last year, incomes rose faster than at any time since at least 1968. Poverty fell at the fastest rate since at least 1968. Businesses turned job losses into 15 million new jobs. Twenty million more people have health insurance who didn't have it before. We kicked our addiction to foreign oil, doubled our production of renewable energy, became the world's leader in fighting climate change, brought home more of our men and women in uniform, took out Usama bin Laden, made sure that in all 50 States people have the freedom to marry who they love. We did that! That's what we did over these last 8 years. That's what you helped to make happen.\nAnd as I've traveled across all 50 States, as I've gone to big cities and small hamlets, what I have always seen is what makes America great, and that is its people. I have seen you: Americans of every faith, every race, every party, who know that we're stronger together—people young and old; men, women; gay, straight; Black, White, Latino, Asian, Native American; folks with disabilities—all pledging allegiance to the red, white, and blue.\nThat's the America I know. That's the America we love. And there's only one candidate in this race who has devoted her entire life to lifting up that better America, and that is the next President of the United States, Hillary Rodham Clinton. She's the right person. She's the right person at the right time.\nBut keep in mind, North Carolina, all the progress that we've made over the last 8 years, all the progress we hope to make over the next 8 years, all of that goes out the window if we don't win this election. And we don't win this election, potentially, if we don't win North Carolina.\nSo I hate to put a little pressure on you, but the fate of the Republic rests on your shoulders. [Laughter] The fate of the world is teetering, and you, North Carolina, are going to have to make sure that we push it in the right direction.\nNow, I know that at the end of a campaign, you must be tired of TV commercials. There are so many negative ads, and there's so much noise, and there are so many distractions. And everything is—every day is just hysteria and over-the-top coverage. And at a certain point, there's a temptation to want to just tune it out. You kind of feel overdosed. Even those of us in politics sometimes feel like, I've had enough politics. [Laughter] I understand the feeling, I promise you.\nBut I want you to push away the noise for a second and just focus on the choice you face in this election. Because the truth is, the choice, if we put aside all the noise, all the distractions, all the hype, all the nonsense, if you push all that away, this choice actually could not be simpler, it could not be clearer. It really couldn't.\nOkay, we've got somebody who fell, which is what I expected. Give them some room. Make sure they get a little water. And if the emergency medical is available, just make sure that you know that there is somebody down right here in the middle. They'll be okay. They'll be okay. It happens all the time. Now—okay, but hold on a second, I'm still focused on bidness. [Laughter] Not business, bidness.\nThis choice actually is pretty clear, because the guy that the Republicans nominated—even though a bunch of them knew they shouldn't nominate him—[laughter]—the guy they nominated—who many of the Republicans he is running against said was a \"con artist\" and a know-nothing and wasn't qualified to hold this office—this guy is temperamentally unfit to be Commander in Chief, and he is not equipped to be President.\nAnd this is not—this should not be a controversial claim. [Laughter] It really shouldn't. I mean, it's strange how, over time, what is crazy gets normalized and we just kind of assume, well, you know what, he said a hundred crazy things, so the hundred-and-first thing we just don't even notice.\nBut think about it. This is somebody who claims to be a great businessman. I know a lot of businesspeople, right here in North Carolina and all across the country, who've done really, really well without stiffing small businesses or workers out of what they owed them. We don't have a history of somebody who refuses to release any tax returns at all. And maybe it's because he's not as rich as he says he is. Maybe it's because he hasn't paid Federal income taxes in years. Now, this is something he said—this is not me making it up—he hasn't paid a dime. Not for our troops, not for our veterans, not for our great universities, not for our community colleges, not for building roads, not for maintaining our National Parks, not for any of the things that help keep America the greatest nation on Earth.\nHe says he'll be his own foreign policy adviser. He says he can do that because he has a \"good brain.\" [Laughter] Now, that is contestable. [Laughter] But what I can tell you is, we can't afford a President who suggests that America should torture people or that we should ban entire religions from our country. We deserve better than a Commander in Chief who insults POWs or attacks a Gold Star mom or denigrates our troops. We have had a Republican Senator—not me, a Republican Senator—say we can't afford to give the nuclear codes to someone so erratic. Now, if a Republican Senator says that about the guy, why would we consider giving him the nuclear codes? It's like Hillary said: \"A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.\" You can't do it.\nAnd yet, look, we have to acknowledge, he's got support. He's got support here in North Carolina. He's got support in other States. And part of it is, is because he's been able to convince some people that he's going to be their voice. Now, keep in mind, this is somebody who spent 70 years on this Earth showing no respect for working people. Working people weren't invited to his hotels or his golf courses unless they were the maid or mowing the fairway. I mean, this is somebody who vilifies minorities, vilifies immigrants, vilifies people of Muslim faith, makes fun of Americans with disabilities. How is that person going to be your voice? Do you want somebody to be your voice who on tape brags about how being famous allows him to get away with sexual assault?\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. Who calls women pigs or dogs or slobs and grades them on a scale of 1 to 10?\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. That is not the voice of America. That's not the better angels of our nature. And we have a choice. We can choose that, or we can choose to teach our kids that our diversity is our strength; that women are full and equal citizens capable of doing anything a man does; that our job, particularly when we have positions of authority, particularly when this country has blessed us, is to treat everybody with dignity, treat everybody with respect, to treat everybody with generosity and kindness.\nWe have to stop thinking that his behavior is normal, that it's within the bounds of what has, up until this point, been our normal political discourse. And you hear some folks now justifying it and making excuses. You hear some Republicans who—they know he's not qualified, but they say, well, you know what, character doesn't matter and knowing the issues doesn't matter and policy doesn't matter so long as he supports the Republican agenda.\nBut I have to tell you, this office, it's about who you are and what you are, and it doesn't change after you occupy the office. It just magnifies it. If you disrespect women before you are elected President, you will disrespect women when you're in office. If you accept the support of Klan sympathizers—the Klan—and hesitate when asked about that support, then you'll tolerate that support when you're in office. If you disrespect the Constitution before you're elected President and you threaten to shut down the press when it writes stories about you that you don't like or threaten—or you threaten to throw your opponent in jail without any due process or you discriminate against people of different faiths, then imagine what you'll do when you actually have the power to violate the Constitution along those lines.\nAnd I want to speak not just to Democrats; I want to speak to Republicans here in North Carolina as well. You know, look, I am obviously a partisan Democrat. I understand that. But we're not Democrats or Republicans first. We're Americans first. And there are certain standards of behavior that we should expect out of our leaders.\nI've got Republican friends who don't think or act the way Donald Trump does. This is somebody who is uniquely unqualified. I ran against John McCain. I ran against Mitt Romney. I thought I'd be a better President, but I never thought that the Republic was at risk if they were elected. And guess what, North Carolina, the good news is, all of you are uniquely qualified to make sure this guy who is uniquely unqualified does not become President. You've just got to vote. You've just got to vote. And the nice thing is, you don't just have to vote against that guy because you've got a candidate who is actually worthy of your vote, who is smart and who is steady and who is tested, is probably the most qualified person ever to run for this office, and that is the next President of the United States, Hillary Clinton.\nHere is somebody who has dedicated her life to making this country better. Think about how she got her start. While Donald Trump and his dad were being sued by the Department of Justice for denying housing to African American families—no, I'm not making this up; I mean, I'm just stating facts—at that same time, Hillary was going undercover from school to school to make sure disadvantaged kids were getting an equal shot at a good education. That tells you something about their respective values.\nAnd Hillary hasn't stopped fighting for justice, hasn't stopped fighting for equality ever since. Her heart has always been in the right place, and she works hard every single day. I know; she worked for me. [Laughter]\nFirst of all, she ran against me, and she worked really hard. [Laughter] And then she worked for me, and she worked really hard. And she was there in the Situation Room, and she was there in the Oval Office. And when we were making big decisions about going after bin Laden even when it was risky, when it was time for us to figure out how to win back world opinion in the wake of the Iraq war, she circled the globe tirelessly as Secretary of State, earned the respect of world leaders.\nAnd she—you know what, she's not flashy. She's not going around spending all her time giving big stemwinders. And as a consequence, sometimes, she's underappreciated here at home. But she made me a better President. And she's an outstanding public servant. And she knows her stuff. And she understands the challenges we face. And she is tough. And when things don't go her way, she doesn't whine, and she doesn't complain. She doesn't blame others, suggesting everything is rigged. [Laughter]\nI had a chance to meet the Tar Heels basketball teams, the men and the women. And you know, here's one thing I know: If in the middle of a game you're spending all your time arguing with the refs and starting to make excuses about how you're going to lose because the refs aren't doing the right thing, then you're a loser—[laughter]—and you shouldn't win.\nAnd Hillary, she just works through whatever is in front of her. She's got grit, and she's got resilience. And if she gets knocked down, she just comes back up, and she goes back at it. And she knows, most importantly, what the decisions that a President makes means to you.\nThis isn't abstract stuff we're talking about here. If you're a student, whether you get a Pell grant or we're able to make sure that you don't have a mountain of debt when you get out of school, that depends on decisions that are made in part by the President. If you're a soldier, whether you get deployed to some far-off land, that is up to the Commander in Chief.\nIf you're a young person who was brought to this country as a child, has grown up as an American, but maybe don't have—doesn't have the papers and now you're trying to figure out how you can contribute to this country you call home, that is something the President has influence over. Veterans, seniors, a single mom who needs some help with childcare—that's what these decisions are about. And Hillary understands that, and she knows those folks need a champion.\nAnd she's actually got plans to help. She's actually got plans. The other guy is not a big plan guy. She's got plans. She can show you how she's going to make sure more people have early childhood education. She's going to show how young people can have more affordable college educations. And while she's executing those plans, she's also going to respect working Americans and the values we care about.\nShe'll be a Commander in Chief who finishes the job defeating ISIL. She will be smart, and she will be steady. And by the way, she's going to need help, and that's why I want all of you to also focus on making sure Deborah Ross is going to be a Senator right alongside her when Hillary gets elected. Because Deborah has heard your stories. She's been out there fighting for working families, making sure they get a fair shot and a great education and that seniors are secure with the retirement that they have earned. And unlike her opponent, she doesn't support Donald Trump.\nI want to take a minute just to talk about Senator Burr. He and I came in together when we were in the Senate, and personally, he's a decent guy. I've got nothing wrong—nothing against Richard Burr. But when I hear him say there's not a separation between me and Donald Trump, that's troubling. Either he actually means it, in which case he agrees with everything Donald Trump says; that's what it says—that's what you mean when you say there's not a separation. Or he doesn't mean it, and he's just saying it to get elected. That's not good either way. [Laughter] You don't want a Senator who spends all his time saying: \"Yes, sir, Mr. Trump. What do you want me to do, Mr. Trump?\" And lately, he's been mimicking Donald Trump. Last week, he actually joked about violence against Hillary. That's not something we do. That's not something—I tell you, if I heard a Democrat saying that, I would condemn them in a hot second. You don't talk about violence against public officials, even in a joke.\nAnd you know, I want to acknowledge, he apologized. But the problem is, this is becoming normal. This is sort of the red meat they're throwing their audiences. And it's not normal. And it's not who North Carolina is. North Carolina is full of good and decent people and courteous people and people who are willing to cooperate with each other to try to make things better. And that's what America is about.\nSo let me be clear, North Carolina——\nAudience member. Bidness.\nThe President. Bidness. Let me be clear. There is something more at stake in this election than just plans or policies. This is about the character of our Nation.\nWhen Hillary was young, her mom taught her the Methodist creed: Do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, as long as you ever can. That's her north star. That's what guides her. She believes in that. She believes we can summon what's best in each of us and make this country better for all of us.\nThat's what America is about. We are a country like no other, not because of the size of our skyscrapers or the power of our armies, but because we are a place founded for the sake of an idea: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights.\" We don't have to be born into wealth or privilege in this country. We don't have to practice a certain faith. We don't have to have a certain last name. We just have to be willing to contribute. We just have to be willing to put our shoulder to the wheel of history, and we can be a part of this community that we call America.\nThat's what drove patriots to choose revolution over tyranny. That's what led GIs to liberate a continent. That's what gave women the courage to reach for the ballot. That's what gave marchers the courage to cross a bridge in Selma. That's what allowed workers to organize for collective bargaining and better wages. That's what made America exceptional. That's what makes America great.\nIn other words, America depends on you—you, all of you. America has never been about what one person says he'll do for us. I didn't say, \"Yes, I can.\" I said, \"Yes, we can.\" It's about what can be achieved by us, each of us, together, through that hard, slow, and, yes, sometimes frustrating work of self-government. That means all of us.\nJustice Louis Brandeis once said, \"The most important office in a democracy is the office of citizen.\" Not President, not Senator, not mayor, Congressman—citizen. That's you. And that's what Hillary is counting on. Because she understands that in a big democracy like this, a diverse country like this, it all comes down to what the people say. And she understands it doesn't work, our democracy doesn't work if we demonize each other, if we just make stuff up, if we spend all our time just trying to tear the other person down just for the sake of seeing if we can get a little more power.\nShe understands that issues aren't black and white, and yes, progress requires compromise, even when you're right. And she knows that none of us are perfect, not even our Presidents, but that we should try to conduct ourselves with basic honesty and decency and big-heartedness, because that's what our moms and dads taught us. And they were on to something. They understood that sometimes what life is about is pretty simple—it's, like, how do you treat people? Are you useful? Are you kind? Are you generous? Do you treat people with respect? She understands that. And Hillary will continue the progress that we've made, and she'll need allies like Deborah Ross.\nBecause it's not enough just to stick Hillary with a Republican Congress the way they're behaving right now. I wish they were behaving differently. I've tried. I've reached out to them. They didn't work with me when I took office, even when we were trying to save folks' jobs and prevent a depression. Even when they control the Senate and the House, they have trouble passing their own stuff. And so they just resort constantly to gridlock and obstruction and threats to shut down the Government and wreck the economy if they don't get their way. That's not how democracy works. That's not what your parents taught you. We teach even our little kids in the sandbox, well, share and cooperate and don't hit each other. [Laughter]\nAnd right now, because a lot of them think that Trump will lose, they're already promising even more unprecedented dysfunction in Washington, which is pretty hard to do. [Laughter] They're promising years of investigations, years of hearings, more shutdowns, more obstruction. I am not making this up. It is all—take a look. This is what they're saying. More repeal votes. Some are saying they won't appoint a ninth Supreme Court Justice at all. Deborah's opponent, Senator Burr, just said—just said—that if Hillary wins, he'll do everything he can to block all Supreme Court nominations. Now, keep in mind that the reason they said they would not have a hearing or vote for my Supreme Court nomination, bucking all of American history, was because we thought the American people should decide the next Supreme Court justice. Now they're saying, well, if they don't decide the way we want them to decide, maybe we won't even do that.\nEleven years ago, Richard Burr said a Supreme Court without nine Justices would not work. Well, what changed? [Laughter] What, only Republican Presidents get to nominate judges? Is that in the Constitution? I used to teach constitutional law. I've never seen that provision.\nYou've got some Republicans in Congress who are already suggesting they will impeach Hillary. She hasn't even been elected yet. [Laughter] It doesn't matter what evidence, they just—they'll find something. That's what they're saying already. How can—how does our democracy function like that?\nLook, nobody likes gridlock. But let—I want to be clear about something: Gridlock is not some mysterious fog that just kind of descends on Washington. It's not like some apparition that shows up. It's not like a monster movie—oh, \"Gridlock\" is coming. [Laughter] That's not how it works. Gridlock is not happening because both sides, Democrats and Republicans, are being equally unreasonable. I mean, I know it's hard to view me as objective here, but I'm about to leave, so I just—I'm just letting you know the truth. Wait, wait, hold on, I've still got some business to do. Gridlock is what happens when Republican politicians like Richard Burr decide—not based on the merits, not based on what's good for their constituents, but based on political calculation—that they are going to oppose anything that is good for the country just because a Democrat proposes it. That's how gridlock happens. And that's essentially Richard Burr's campaign platform at this point.\nAnd I said before, I know Richard Burr. He's actually—I used to work out with him in the gym in Senate. He's a perfectly nice guy. [Laughter] But what's happened is, is that they have built up this new normal in their party where he's got to say anything in order to get elected. So if you think \"Vote for gridlock\" is a good slogan—[laughter]—then you should vote for the Republicans. [Laughter] But if you believe, like I believe, that America can do better; if you believe that we should be out there not trying to block each other from doing stuff, but creating jobs for families, lifting wages, childcare; if you care about equal pay for women and raising the minimum wage, then I need you to vote for Democrats up and down the ticket. I need you to vote for Hillary Clinton. I need you to vote for Deborah Ross. They're ready to roll up their sleeves and move this country forward. They don't want to look backwards, they want to go forward.\nLook, I know it's easy to get cynical. There's a lot in this election season that can give you reason to be cynical. But right now I just want you to know, all of you, it's in your power to reject the divisive, mean-spirited politics that would take us backwards. That's not how it has to be. That's not how it's always been. But it's going to depend on you. You can elect a leader who has spent her entire life trying to move this country forward; our first female President who will be an example for our daughters and our sons that everybody has a chance to contribute and serve.\nYou have a chance to shape history. What an amazing thing that is. If Hillary wins North Carolina, she wins. And that means that when I said the fate of the Republic rests on you, I wasn't joking. [Laughter] But that shouldn't make you fearful, that should make you excited. It's not often when you can move the arc of history. Don't let that chance slip away. Young people here, it's not often that you know your voice will have an impact. Don't let it slip away. Don't give away your power.\nDon't fall for the easy cynicism that says my vote doesn't matter or all politicians are the same. It does matter, and they're not all the same. That's what Hillary's opponent wants you to think, because they don't want you to vote. And I've got to say, he has been getting help from Republican politicians in this State who have been trying to keep you from voting. I—we're the only advance democracy on Earth that purposely tries to make it harder for people to vote.\nBut even within sometimes unfortunate traditions in America, what's been going on lately here in the States has been really troubling. A few years ago in North Carolina, Republicans passed a law that made it harder for African Americans to vote. That is not my opinion. Earlier this year, a Federal judge said that, based on the evidence, those who voted for these laws targeted Black voters with—and I'm quoting—\"surgical precision.\" It was one of the worst voter suppression laws in the country. Here, in North Carolina. Not back in the 1960s, now.\nAlready, right now, Donald Trump is calling on his supporters to monitor \"certain areas.\" Where are those certain areas he's talking about? They are groups that are not even making secret plans. They're just out in public saying we're going to try and suppress the African American vote on election day or the youth vote on election day.\nIf you think that is accidental, then I want you to think about a woman named Grace Bell Hardison.\nAudience member. [Inaudible]\nThe President. [Laughter] Grace Bell lived in Belhaven, North Carolina, her entire life, all 100 years of her life. Just a few weeks ago, Republicans challenged her voter registration status and tried to remove her from the voter rolls. And she heard about it, and she said, \"I can't vote.\" Hundred years old.\nNow, Grace got her voter registration reinstated. And you better believe she's going to vote. But this 100-year-old woman wasn't alone in being targeted. The list of voters Republicans tried to purge was two-thirds Black and Democratic. That didn't happen by accident. It's happening in counties across this State. Now, there was a time when systematically denying Black folks the right to vote was considered normal as well.\nAnd so, young people, I want you to listen up. And. parents, I want you to talk about this: It was not that long ago that folks had to guess the number of jellybeans in a jar or bubbles on a bar of soap or recite the Constitution in Chinese in order to vote. It wasn't that long ago when folks were beaten trying to register voters in Mississippi. It wasn't that long ago that a man named Henry Frye in Greensboro, the first African American chief justice of North Carolina's Supreme Court, was denied the right to register to vote because he had failed a so-called literacy test, after he had graduated from college. It wasn't that long ago.\nGrace Bell Hardison, 100 years old, imagine what she's seen in the arc of her life. Born in a time where there were barely cars on the road, no planes in the sky. Think about everything she's seen. A great-grandmother, probably a great-great-grandmother. How are you—how are we going to let, after all she's been through, folks disrespect her like that? How are we going to betray all those who worked so hard, risked everything for the vote so that we could pull the lever? And we're not going to vote? What's our excuse?\nNow, those who wanted to suppress the vote, they're going to fail. The law was struck down. Your rights have been restored. Right now there are more one-stop early vote sites in North Carolina than ever before. You can register and vote at any site in your county, as long as you do it by Saturday. It's easier to vote than ever in North Carolina. But if you don't vote, then you've done the work of those who would suppress your vote without them having to lift a finger. Come on.\nBack in 2008, I won North Carolina by 14,000 votes. That's about two votes per precinct. If just two votes per precinct had gone the other way, I would have lost North Carolina. How can you say your vote doesn't count? Each of you could swing an entire precinct for Hillary if you vote. Or you could swing it for her if you don't vote. Your vote matters. Young people especially, your vote matters.\nIf you've been marching for criminal justice reform, that's great. But you know what, you'd better vote for a President and a Congress who actually care about disrupting the pipeline from underfunded schools to overcrowded jails. Protests aren't enough if you're not voting. You've been marching for the environment and to do something about climate change, I've heard you. But you'd better vote for the next President and Congress believing in science and who will protect the progress we've made so we can leave behind a world that we're proud of for our children.\nIf you want more good jobs, you want to have a higher minimum wage, you want help with respect to student loans, don't just sit there and complain. Don't just sit there in the barber shop and the beauty shop and watching the Tar Heels and say, ah, you know, politics is all messed up, but what's the score? No, no, no. You can watch the game after you vote.\nAnd the good news is, you've got a proof point. You know it works. You know it works because so many of you voted in '08. And it's because of you that millions of people have health care today that didn't have it before. It's because of you that millions of young people are going to college that couldn't afford it before. It's because of you that a marine can serve his country without hiding the husband he loves. It's because of you that more young immigrants came out of the shadows and are serving our country. North Carolina, I'm asking you today what I asked of you 8 years ago. I'm just asking you to believe not in my abilities to change, not even just in Hillary's ability to bring about positive change. I'm asking you to believe in your ability to bring about change. I am not on the ballot, but I tell you what, fairness is on the ballot. Decency is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot. Progress is on the ballot. Our democracy is on the ballot right now.\nAnd Hillary gives you a chance to advance our democracy. But you've got to do everything you can to make sure everybody votes: your friends, your family, your cousins, your uncle, your neighbors, your coworkers. Tell them this is the moment where America stands up for our best selves. Stand up and reject cynicism. Stand up and reject fear.\nChoose hope. Choose hope. Choose hope. Vote! And if you do, we will elect Hillary Clinton the next President of the United States. We will elect Deborah Ross the next Senator from the great State of North Carolina. We'll continue this amazing journey and finish what we started and remind the world why this is the greatest country on Earth.\nGod bless you, North Carolina. God bless the United States of America.", "timestamp": "2016-11-02", "title": "Remarks at a Campaign Rally for Democratic Presidential Nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton in Chapel Hill, North Carolina"}

And early this morning, they were taken from us in shameful acts of violence.\nSergeant Anthony Beminio and Officer Justin Martin represented our best, most decent instincts as human beings: to serve our neighbors, to put ourselves in harm's way for someone else. They knew the dangers of their job. They knew the risks. Yet they chose to dedicate themselves to those values anyway. So today Michelle and I join Americans across our country in expressing our condolences and stand in solidarity with their grieving families, fellow officers, and the communities they served so honorably.\nAll across the country, our police officers go to work each day not knowing whether they'll come home at night. Their families live each day with the same fears. So as Americans, we owe them our respect and gratitude for their efforts to safeguard our families and our communities. And so, as we once again mourn American police officers lost in the line of duty, we must also renew the call to match that same sense of service, that same devotion within our own lives and our own communities.\nThankfully, that's the Iowa I know well. That's what I've experienced every time I've visited Urbandale and Des Moines: good, big-hearted people who look out for each other and are willing to come together across our differences. That's the spirit we all must summon now not only to heal, but to honor the service of Sergeant Beminio, Officer Martin, and all the men and women who wear the blue.", "timestamp": "2016-11-02", "title": "Statement on the Shootings of Police Officers in Des Moines and Urbandale, Iowa"}
{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "note": "Remarks as delivered. Secretary Clinton was introduced by Alicia Machado, former Miss Universe.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119498", "text": "Hello, Dade City!\nI am so excited about being here. Thank you, all for this really warm, wonderful welcome. And I thank, on behalf of all of us I want to thank Alicia Machado for that introduction and for sharing her story with us. Alicia will be voting for the very first time in this election, and I am very grateful for her support. I'm also delighted that we're joined today by your great senator Bill Nelson and his wife Grace.\nI also want to thank Representative Amanda Hickman from the Florida State House, Michael Cox, chairman of the Greater Pasco Chamber of Commerce, Michael Ledbetter, who is the Pasco County Democratic executive committee chair and his wife Beverly. And thanks to retired Colonel Wilson Elton [inaudible] for his pledge of allegiance. And thanks to all the elected officials here. And I especially want to thank all of you for not just joining us but helping us to get out the vote in this last week!\nIt's almost hard to believe, isn't it? There are only seven days left in this election.\nSo are you ready to vote?\nAre you ready to volunteer these last seven days?\nI hope too that you ready to elect Patrick Murphy to the United States Senate! Patrick, who's been in Congress, will be an independent voice for Florida families. And I am so excited to think about what he could do, because unlike his opponent, he's never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.\nNow somebody asked me the other day, 'Why do you keep coming back to Florida?' Just look around folks. I mean it is a beautiful, and I have lots of friends, but it's also really important in this election. Florida can decide who our next president is, which will affect the nation and the world. And I want to make sure that every voter in Florida spends these next seven days thinking about what's at stake in this election. Because honestly I believe this may be the most important election of our lifetimes.\nOne week from today, we will be choosing our next president and commander-in-chief of the United States. I don't think the choice could be any clearer. I have spent my career fighting for children and families. I have served in the United States Senate, served on the Senate Armed Services Committee. I was in the Situation Room when we brought Osama Bin Laden to justice. I represented you as your secretary of state, going to 112 countries, negotiating with friend and foe alike. I am ready to serve if you give me the great honor of being your president.\nNow, I do have to say that I think that stands in contrast to my opponent. And maybe for you if you think about all of the issues that separate Donald Trump from me, it could be his dangerous statements about nuclear weapons.\nWhen a journalist told Donald Trump that people were worried about how casually he talks about using nuclear weapons, he said, 'Well then why are we making them?'\nAnd I have to tell you yesterday I was in Ohio, and I was introduced by a gentleman who was one of our officers in charge of launching nuclear weapons if the order ever came from our president. And what he told the crowd — it was a big crowd at Kent State University — I think every voter should hear. Basically — his name was Bruce Blair — he said that, having had the responsibility of sitting in a bunker, being responsible for the codes and the keys to our nuclear weapons, he knows that when a president makes the order to launch a nuclear attack, there is no appeal. There is no veto. And that is why he has joined with dozens of former Air Force officers to send a letter to say, 'We need a president with the temperament, the steadiness, the calmness to be in charge of nuclear weapons.' And therefore they cannot support Donald Trump, because he does not have the temperament to be our commander-in-chief and handle those responsibilities.\nSo when you think about voting, early this week, voting next Tuesday, responsibility for our nuclear weapons is on the ballot.\nSo is immigration. Do we want to round up millions of people who are here working, raising their families, as he has suggested he will do? I don't think so. I think what we want is to bring them out of the shadows so that they can't be exploited by employers like Donald Trump, who refused to hire Americans and hired undocumented workers so he could pay them less. I don't think that's right.\nNow maybe for some of you, what Donald Trump said about prisoners of war will be enough reason to vote against him, somebody who questioned the patriotism and the service of John McCain because he was a prison of war. We need a Commander in Chief who respects the service and sacrifice of the men and women who wear our uniform.\nOr maybe for some of you, it's what he said about a judge born in Indiana, who just happened to be assigned the case brought by people who were defrauded by the phony Trump University. And so Trump said, 'Well, we can't trust him because his parents were born in Mexico.' Now Paul Ryan, the Republican Speaker of the House, called — well, but wait a minute, — he called what Trump said about that distinguished federal judge, 'The definition of a racist comment.'\nAnd then Trump went on to attack a Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died defending our country, simply because that family was Muslim.\nAnd then let's not forget, Trump spent years, years insisting that President Obama was not born in the United States, even after the birth certificate was produced. Honestly if this were something new, I think we'd all be asking ourselves, 'Well, what does he have against President Obama?' Or what does he have against me? But this is not new. I know I'm reaching out to Republicans and Independents as well as Democrats because I want to be the president for all Americans.\nAnd here's what I want you to tell. I want you to tell your Republican friends, in 1987 Donald Trump took out a Donald Trump took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times to criticize President Reagan. He said, 'Our leaders are the laughing stock of the world.' So this is a man who thinks that he is better than President Reagan, better than President Obama – literally better than anybody, I guess. And, when you think about it, what he said at the convention, 'I alone can fix it,' runs counter to who we are as Americans. We work together.\nSo there are many reasons why I think it is fair to conclude that Donald Trump is unqualified and unfit to be president. But today, I want to just spend a few minutes focusing in particular about what he has said and what he has done to woman and girls because – Any of you see the debates? I stood next to Donald for four and a half hours during those three debates, proving conclusively I have the stamina to be President of the United States. And during those debates, Donald always used to say, 'What have you been doing for 30 years?' And I always found that kind of odd, because he could Google it and find out. And so I've been a lawyer, and I've been a first lady, and I've been a senator, and I've been Secretary of State, and I've been a wife and a mother and a grandmother and a friend and a churchgoer, and for my entire life I've been a woman.\nAnd when I think about what we now know about Donald Trump and what he's been doing for 30 years, he sure has spent a lot of time demeaning, degrading, insulting, and assaulting women. And, I've got to tell you, some of what we've learned – some of this stuff is very upsetting. I would, frankly, rather be here talking about nearly anything else, like how we're going to create good jobs and get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top. How we're going to make college affordable for every single family, because I have a plan that if your family makes less than $125,000, you will not pay tuition to go to a state college or university. And if you're above that, it will be debt free, and we will help you pay back the debt you already have so you can get out from under it.\nBut I can't just talk about all of the good things we want to do, because people are making up their minds. This is a consequential choice, so we've got to talk about something that, frankly, is painful, because it matters. We can't just wish it away. And a lot of his supporters don't like to hear this. I don't blame them. If I were supporting him, I wouldn't want to hear it either, to be honest. But I've got to tell you, I learned way back in elementary school and I learned it in Sunday school: it's not okay to insult people. It's not okay.\nAnd look at what he does. He calls women 'ugly,' 'disgusting,' 'nasty' all the time. He calls women 'pigs,' rates bodies on a scale from 1 to 10. We just heard from Alicia. She was Miss Universe when Donald Trump owned the pageant. Well, he said she put on some weight and it made him angry, so he called her 'Miss Piggy.' He called her 'Miss Housekeeping' because she's a beautiful Latina. He brought a bunch of reporters to a gym to watch him order her around to exercise. Now, he also said, 'This is somebody who likes to eat.' Well, I have to say: who doesn't like to eat? I mean, really, can we just stop for a minute and reflect on the absurdity of Donald Trump finding fault with Miss Universe?\nBut you've got to ask: why does he do these things? Who acts like this? And, I'll tell you who: a bully, that's who. And thankfully, Alicia refuses to let such a small person get her down. She knows that Donald Trump doesn't get to decide her value in her eyes and in the eyes of her family and her friends.\nBut what about our girls? What about girls watching all this? What happens to their confidence, their sense of self-worth? If you've got a daughter, a granddaughter, a sister, a mother, a wife, a good friend, someone like this becoming president who insults more than half the population of the United States of America? And what about our boys? This is not someone we want them looking up to.\nNot so long ago, I was the mother of a teenage girl. And every day I tried to make sure that she knew she was smart and she was capable, and I'm doing the same thing with my granddaughter and my grandson. Because, let's be honest here, the world has a way of telling our girls exactly the opposite – they don't look right, they're not thin enough, they don't act right, no one will like them unless they change their clothes or straighten their hair or stop being bossy, or whatever the criticism might be. Right?\nAnd I remember, when Chelsea was a teenager, I would wait on the second floor of the White House in the long hall that's there for her to come home from school. And sometimes, we only had a few minutes together. But before she'd run off to talk to her friends or do whatever she was planning to, I would figure out how was the day. We'd talk about what was on her mind. And that time together was really valuable to me as a parent, because we parents, and I know there are a lot of parents here today, we work hard to give our kids a sense of confidence to send them out into the world believing in their own value, and it really is important that we don't let anybody take that away from them. And we want them to be strong, and we don't want them to feel bad about themselves. And we've got to work hard to make sure our boys, just like our girls, have that same sense of positive energy: not negative, not tearing people down – lifting people up and respecting women.\nIn fact, all of us should respect each other in our country. So, when I look at my granddaughter and my grandson, I am on the same mission. I want them to know they're love, they're cared for, they're respected. I want them to develop a good work ethic. I believe in hard work, and I want them to go out and prove themselves in the world. But that's what I want for every child. I have spent my life doing everything I could to help kids and families. It will be the mission of my presidency. I will get up every day in the White House trying to figure out: how can we knock down the barriers, overcome the challenges so that people living here in Pasco County can get ahead and stay ahead?\nSo I know there's work to be done. We can't do it with just words alone. We've got to do more to stop treatment about women being somehow objectified. And, oh my gosh, when we heard that tape and we heard what he does to women. I'm not going to repeat it. But you know what Donald Trump was bragging about: grabbing women, mistreating women. And I have to tell you, since that tape came out, twelve women have come to say that, 'What he said on that tape is what he did to me.'\nAnd then we heard his response. What he does at his rallies is to go after those women all over again, insulting them. He said he couldn't possibly have said those things because the women weren't attractive enough to assault. 'Look at her,' he said about one woman. 'I don't think so.' About another, he said, 'She wouldn't be my first choice.'\nHe's also on tape bragging with the radio personality Howard Stern about how he used to go backstage at beauty pageants to barge in on the women while they were getting dressed. He said he did that — he said he did that to 'inspect' them. That was his word – and he said, 'I sort of get away with things like that.' And sure enough, contestants have come forward to say, 'Yes, that's exactly what he did to us.' Now, as bad as that is, he didn't just do it at the Miss USA pageant or the Miss Universe pageant. He's also been accused of doing it at the Miss Teen USA pageant. Contestants say that Donald Trump came in to look at them when they were changing. Some of them were just 15 years old.\nWe cannot hide from this. We've got to be willing to face it. This man wants to be president of the United States of America and our First Lady, Michelle Obama, spoke for many of us when she said Donald Trump's words have shaken her to her core.\nFor a lot of women who have gone through something like this in your lives, that's brought back painful memories. And for men who would never, ever talk or act like Donald, it's been shocking to see this. He tried to explain it away as 'locker room talk,' well, I'll tell you what, a lot of professional athletes stood up and said, 'Not in our locker rooms. That does not happen.'\nWell, I guess the bottom line is he thinks belittling women makes him a bigger man.\nAnd I don't think there's a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like.\nHe doesn't look at us and see full human beings, with our dreams and purposes, our own capabilities. And he has shown us that clearly throughout this campaign.\nWell, he's very wrong. He is wrong about both the women and the men of this country. He has shown us who he is. Let us on Tuesday show him who we are. We can stand up for what we believe, what we want for our children and grandchildren, what we know is right. And you can go down the list of everything he has said. He doesn't believe in equal pay, he thinks pregnancy is an inconvenience, he won't raise the minimum wage, and he said if he comes home and dinner is not on the table, he gets angry. Instead of supporting women who are out there supporting their families, he wants to make it even harder.\nWell, I have a message for him. We're going to fight for affordable childcare. We're going to fight for equal pay for all people. We're going to fight for paid family leave, we're going to fight to make sure everybody gets raising wages in America and that's important because so many people still struggling, still working hard, raising a family, having a hard time getting all of their bills paid. And that's especially true for minimum wage workers — who — two-thirds of whom are women, so we've got work to do my friends. I'm excited because I know we can do this and I will stand up and I will fight for you, I will work for you, I will give my heart to this mission of making our country all it should be. Because instead of Donald Trump's dangerous and divisive vision, mine is positive, optimistic, hopeful and unifying.\nBut I can't do any of this without your help. Early voting has already begun. Almost 26 millions Americans have already voted and that includes four million right here in Florida. Americans are voting for the kind of better future we can make together. And voting on all the issues that they care about. It may be my name and Donald's name on the ballot but everything you care about, our security, our economy, bringing our country together, the environment, clean water and clean air!\nHere in Dade City, you can vote every day from now until November 5th, from 7am to 7pm.\nIn fact, right now, the East Pasco Government Center is just a few minutes' drive away. You can go there right after this rally and vote. Because, we need everybody to stand up in this election.\nAnd if you have a mail-in ballot at home, send it in when you get home today.\nDon't wait to send it back! Talk friends and family and neighbors and co-workers.\nDonald Trump's strategy is pretty simple– he said he wants to suppress young people from voting women from voting, people of color from voting, that is a lot of people. By showing up with the biggest turnout ever we will show him and everybody a message that that is not who we are.\nNow I know here in this county and this larger region, you probably know some people who are going to vote for Trump. And here is what I want to ask you, I want you to talk with them. Ask them what they care about. Ask them what kind of future they want for their economy. Because Donald Trump's economic plan is slashing taxes on the wealthy and big corporations. I have said that I want the wealthy to pay their fair share and I will not raise taxes on anybody making less than $250,000 a year.\nSo there could not be, no matter what you care about, a bigger difference between me and Donald Trump, and I hope that you will come out and volunteer for these last seven days.\nWe are signing up for volunteer shifts making calls, knocking on doors, it really matters, turn out matters.\nPlease go to hillaryclinton.com to see how you can get involved. Here is what I want to leave you with. You know, I feel like so many of you, our country is already great but we can make is greater. The main reason America is great is because America is good. We are a big hearted, generous people. Not a small minded people. We know that if everybody works together we will get farther together than if we separate people, we push them down, we engage in all the negativity that we have heard too much in this campaign. But sometimes, the fate of even the greatest nations lie in the balance. For America, this is one of those make or break elections. It really is in your hands.\nI hope you will think about how you will feel the day after the election on November 9th. are we going to more forward together or are we going to move backwards by someone who wants to bully us? And I hope, I hope you will think about how together we can make a difference, I want to be your partner as well as your president, I want us to create the best possible future for our children and our grandchildren. That is what I will work my heart out to do and I hope you will help me to make a better, fairer, stronger America. Where we prove once and for all that love trumps hate!\nThank you all.", "timestamp": "2016-11-03", "title": "Remarks at Pasco-Hernando State College East Campus in Dade City, Florida"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119577", "text": "Aboard Air Force One\nEn Route Jacksonville, Florida\n1:35 P.M. EDT\nMR. SCHULTZ: One quick scheduling announcement. I wanted to make sure you saw that the President and the First Lady will join Secretary Clinton and President Clinton in Philadelphia Monday night for a campaign and get-out-the-vote rally. The President and First Lady are both looking forward to that event.\nBut with that, I'm happy to take your questions.\nQ: Since we're talking about next week, can you give us a sense of how soon after the election the President would hope or expect to meet with the President-elect?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Darlene, as you know, the President is committed to a peaceful transition of power, and that actually involves a lot of work that's been going on for years. The President directed his team to make this a significant priority. He remembers vividly that, in 2008, President George W. Bush's team worked hard to make sure that the transition to the Obama administration was a seamless one, and he wants to do the same for his successor. So that work continues in earnest.\nIn terms of any meeting between President Obama and the President-elect, I don't think that's on the schedule yet, but we'll let you know when that changes.\nQ: What about the President going before the American people to offer his analysis of the election results? Would that be next week, some point also? Could we expect that next week?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Darlene, somehow I don't think there will be any shortage of analysis on this race. I do expect the President to offer his views on the election results, but I don't have anything to preview at this time.\nQ: Eric, I understand we have some members of Congress onboard. Can you tell us who they are?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Sure, Gregory. Senator Bill Nelson and Congressman Patrick Murphy are both on this flight. They are joining us from Miami to Jacksonville, and will not be joining us to Washington.\nQ: Can you talk about the President's -- the energy at these events in the final days? He seems to be -- the President seems to be in full campaign mode. Can you compare this to 2008? He seems to be relishing this opportunity to get on the campaign trail.\nMR. SCHULTZ: I do think you've heard him say that he's got one last campaign in him, and this is it. 2008 -- it's difficult to compare the circumstances. 2008 was a different time for the country, but obviously it was a different race because he was on the ballot.\nThis is a moment where, after eight years, the American people can judge his record and the progress that we've made over the past eight years, and that they have a stark choice before them. He has said that this is not a traditional Democratic versus Republican race -- contest, this election; that this is much more of a question about the direction this country wants to go and the values that we hold dear.\nSo, yes, there's a lot at stake on Tuesday, and the President feels very invested in this race. And I think that's why he's not going to leave anything on the field between now and then.\nQ: I know you say that the scheduling decisions are made by the Clinton campaign, but it's hard not to notice that the President is following up Trump rallies in Miami and Jacksonville, and Jacksonville in a matter of hours or minutes afterwards. Is that a coincidence? Or is the President shadowing Donald Trump on the campaign trail?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Gregory, you probably follow Mr. Trump's schedule more closely than I do. I think it's probably a function of the winnowing battleground map; that as Election Day draws near, there's only so many states that remain in play. And so when you've got a powerful surrogate like President Obama, I suspect the Clinton campaign wants to make sure he's deployed into states that could determine the outcome of the election.\nQ: Eric, Josh has said recently -- said the President is placed with the trajectory of the race, but now the trajectory seems to be favoring Donald Trump increasingly. He's gaining ground in polls, both nationally and in key battleground states. Does the President remain confident that Secretary Clinton will win? Is there any change in strategy or attitude or concern here? Can you describe if, at all, these polls have been a topic of discussion?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Justin, the President is absolutely determined to do everything he can to make sure that the American people elect Secretary Clinton on Tuesday. But if the premise of your question is that complacency can be a problem for Democrats, the answer to that question is yes.\nThe President feels that when Democrats vote, Democrats win. We have seen in some cycles that Democrats don't turn out in the numbers that are high enough for their candidates to prevail. So the President is crisscrossing this country. As you all have observed, he's got a fairly robust campaign schedule. And that's because the stakes are high. If you look at all the progress we've made over the past eight years -- whether that's rejuvenating this economy to the point where we have the longest stretch of private sector job growth in our nation's history; whether it's bringing the international community together to shut off Iran's path to a nuclear weapon; whether it's making sure this planet is preserved by bringing the international community together to focus on the challenge of climate change; or whether it's extending health care to 20 million Americans; whether it's all we've done to make sure that high school graduation rates are the highest they've ever been -- college enrollment is at historic highs.\nSo we have accomplished a lot over the past eight years, but the President is acutely aware that all of that is at stake in 2016 -- or, more specifically, on Tuesday -- if Republicans prevail, because they have not been shy about their commitment to roll back progress on each of those fronts.\nSo the President is very much invested, not only because all of this progress we've made is on the ballot, as he has said, but because he's in the unique position to size up the two candidates running. He's been in the Oval Office. He's made the decisions that only the Commander-in-Chief makes. And he believes that Secretary Clinton is uniquely qualified to succeed him.\nQ: Moving away from the election, a panel of judges today ruled that Parliament would need to vote on Brexit. Obviously, this is still kind of an ongoing concern -- or ongoing litigation, but luckily not in the United States. So maybe you can comment on it. And I think even if you won't sort of discuss the merits of the case, if you could talk about if there's concern within the administration of the sort of turmoil that this entire process seems to be having on the financial markets.\nMR. SCHULTZ: Justin, we are aware of the decision by the United Kingdom's High Court. We are and will continue to work closely with officials in London, Brussels, and our international partners around the world to ensure continued economic stability, security, and prosperity in Europe and beyond.\nWe urge both the United Kingdom and the European Union in their negotiations to continue to be flexible and work this out in a process that is smooth, pragmatic, transparent and productive.\nWe continue to actively monitor financial and economic developments, and we'll continue to consult closely with international counterparts to support financial stability and growth. I'll add that the special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom endures. It is a bedrock of the United States' foreign policy. But likewise, the European Union remains an indispensable partner for the United States in stimulating economic growth and addressing regional and global challenges.\nQ: Eric, I believe yesterday, a statement was -- an audio statement was released from the Islamic State, from Baghdadi, talking about Mosul, saying no retreat. Do you have any response to that?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Ayesha, we are aware of that tape. But no propaganda can change the reality that week after week, ISIL continues to lose ground. The coalition amassed by the United States has put these terrorists on a path to lasting defeat.\nAs you may recall, two years ago, this ISIL leader announced a phony caliphate for Mosul's great mosque. Today, he's in hiding, unable to show his face in public. Iraqi security forces have entered Mosul for the first time since 2014, and have begun to liberate the city from ISIL's control. This is ISIL's current largest operations center in Iraq, but, as you have observed, liberation of Mosul would follow significant territorial losses from ISIL in the past two years -- that's both in Iraq and in Syria.\nAnd lastly, I would say that part of the coalition's strategy -- a chief part of the coalition's strategy has been taking out ISIL's leadership. That includes the chief operations strategist, the ministers of war, interior, finance, and oil and gas. But that doesn't mean we have to stop being vigilant or determined. The U.S. will continue to lead the coalition of 67 members to keep pressure on ISIL until they are ultimately defeated.\nQ: Does the administration believe that Baghdadi is still in Mosul? You said he's in hiding. I mean, do you believe he's in Mosul? Do you believe he's someplace else?\nMR. SCHULTZ: The reason I said he's in hiding is, in 2014, when he declared this phony caliphate, he did it in public. I think it's been a while since he's been seen in public, and this was obviously a taped audio recording that they released. But I don't have any other -- I don't have any intelligence assessments to read out to you. You might want to check in with the intelligence community.\nQ: Eric, any readout on the meeting last night about the President's foundation and whether there was a TV in the room as they talked about that, and how the President then monitored the remainder of Game 7?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Scott, I can tell you that from time to time, typically when the President is on the road and has some down time, he's taking the opportunity to meet with friends and supporters, to brainstorm on next steps and the work that the foundation is going to be doing. So that was what he availed himself of the opportunity to do last night.\nI don't know if they watched the game inside the event; however, I can confirm the President did watch the game in full upon returning to his hotel last night. Obviously, the President is first and foremost a White Sox fan, but shares in the celebration of Chicago. He is proud of the Cubs. It's a high-quality team. Good players, good manager. And he looks forward to celebrating with them in the White House before he leaves office.\nQ: Is that going to happen?\nMR. SCHULTZ: The invitation is being extended in real time.\nQ: Because all politics is local, Jack Evans, the D.C. Councilmember who chairs Metro's board, said that he would advocate for a federal takeover of WMATA. I'm wondering if that's something that the President would support. I know he's talked in the past generally about the need for additional infrastructure spending, but the D.C. Metro system in particular seems to have hit a crisis point of sorts, and whether that needs a federal response.\nMR. SCHULTZ: He could soon be a customer, a passenger. (Laughter.) Justin, I will take this opportunity to reiterate that the President does believe a well-functioning public transit system is important to the capital region. The President has said many times that if we're serious about our infrastructure -- whether that's water-sewer, bridges, transit systems -- as a country, we need to be serious about ensuring that we are funding our infrastructure rather than slowly allowing it to erode.\nWhen it comes to the Washington Metro system, I will tell you that the federal government already had to intervene to address what the Department of Transportation determined were unacceptable risks to the safety of the people using that system. That's why the Department of Transportation, back in October, I believe, assumed temporary safety oversight, verifying the agency's progress on safety-related corrective actions and critical maintenance operations.\nSo there's no question that we need real solutions here instead of patchwork, and that this is a transit system that's going to need to get its house in order. But it doesn't help that Congress has stalled funding what traditionally has been a bipartisan priority.\nQ: But, I mean, appreciating that -- on the specific idea of a federal control board in sort of the tradition of Detroit or Puerto Rico, is that something that you guys see as necessary or even possible now, or something you'd advocate for, or not?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Look, I'd say that many of the proposals floated I've seen by local officials back in Washington would require congressional action, so I haven't seen that being considered within the administration.\nI would just say, though, that the long-term viability of the Washington transit system is critical, and any solution here is going to require strong collaboration between Maryland, Virginia and the District.\nQ: This question has come up before a couple of times. Do you have any more clarity on who makes the decision to use the presidential seal at a purely political or campaign event, as was the case yesterday and today and all of the President's events this week and early next?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Darlene, I know -- like you said, this question has come up in the past. I don't know if there's a cardinal rule on this. I know that it can sometimes matter from event to event, given the backdrop or the setting of where we're at. I know that in some political events, the seal is used and sometimes it's not. But I don't have any sort of guiding principles beyond that for you on this.\nQ: This is 100 percent a campaign trip, correct? The Air Force One expenses are all being paid for by the Democratic National Committee?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Yes. So there's a formula that's used, because some expenses are just attached to being President of the United States. So there's a formula that's used when trips are -- again, have political components.\nQ: This is 100 percent political. Is it fair to say this trip is -- at least his public schedule is 100 percent political?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I'm going through the schedule in my head, but I don't believe we have any official stops on this trip. So there's a formula that governs however many stops -- whether it's zero, one, two or however many stops -- are political -- are deemed political that dictate the reimbursement from the DNC or political campaign.\nQ: And is \"Come on, man\" the new \"Yes, we can\"?\nMR. SCHULTZ: I heard it's trending, Darlene. But I think it sums up the frustration that not only the President has but that a lot of voters have. That you now have Republicans who previously had said that the next President should pick the next Supreme Court justice, saying even if voters do that and they select a Democrat to be President, that even that Democratic President doesn't have the right to appoint a Supreme Court justice. And it's not just a handful of Republicans, it's the number-two Republican in the Senate who went out of his way to entertain this idea as legitimate.\nThe President believes that's misguided; that the last thing the American people want is more dysfunction and paralysis in Washington. And if Republicans think they've done a good job debilitating their influence in Congress, the last place that dysfunction should spread is the third branch of government.\nQ: Eric, is there any reaction to the reports of in-fighting in the FBI with regard to the investigation into the Clinton Foundation?\nMR. SCHULTZ: Lesa, I've seen a lot of the stories that you're referencing. I don't have anything new to share with you. Obviously, the President places a huge priority on the federal workforce and maintaining high professional standards. He wants everyone, whether they work in law enforcement or other agencies, to perform at their highest capabilities and remember that we're all public servants, and we're all serving the country to the best of our abilities.\nEND 1:54 P.M.

{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "note": "Speech as delivered.  Secretary Clinton was introduced by both Senator Bernie Sanders and Pharrell Williams. Williams is a Grammy award winning song-writer, rapper, and record producer.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119692", "text": "Thank you. Wow! Thank you all. Woo!\nThank you. Thank you. I -- I got to -- I got to say, after hearing -- after hearing from these two extraordinary men I -- I feel all fired up and ready to go for the next five days.\nIt is so great to be back here with all of you, and there are a few people in the audience that I just want to acknowledge because I'm delighted they're there -- U.S. Congressman David Price I saw right there.Thank you, David.\nState Senator Dan Blue Jr., I know, right there. Thank you, Dan.And I'm not sure she's still here, but Deborah Ross, who I hope is your next senator. There she is!\nBecause everything Pharrell and Bernie just said is not only about the presidential election and what's at stake, it is about who's going to represent you as your governor, as your senator, as members of Congress and the legislature, and you have some excellent candidates. And we are so hopeful that you will vote for them and vote for what they represent.\nNow, I really want to thank my friend, Bernie Sanders, for everything that he has done.\nI -- I got to serve with Bernie. We were colleagues in the Senate. I saw firsthand his commitment to the people of Vermont and to the values that have guided his life. And when we faced each other in the primary, here's what I was so proud about. We ran a campaign on the issues that matter to the American people.\nAnd I -- I think because of that campaign, we were able to raise a lot of the issues that you heard Bernie talking about to the level that they are part of this presidential cam-paign, and they will be part of our agenda after January 20th, Bernie.\nAnd I've got to say, too, this election has been a lot more fun now that we're on the same side.\nAnd I want to thank Bernie for everything he's done. He's crisscrossing our country, energizing people, getting folks off the sidelines and engaged in politics. And there's no question that his efforts are paying off.\nAnd what he said at the beginning of his remarks is absolutely true. My name may be on the ballot, but it is not about me, it's not about my opponent, it's not about Bernie, it's not about David or Deborah, it is about you and your lives and what we're going to do together.\nNow, Bernie and I have already worked, we've worked on the plan that he told you about to make college tuition-free for the middle-class, for working families, for poor kids and debt-free for everyone.\nBecause as Bernie said earlier this year, when people who care about progressive causes stand together, we win, and then we can get to work on making those causes into realities for the lives of our people. So I am proud to be here with you and I am so excited about -- of the election, about everything that we're going to do together.\nAnd I'm especially pleased to have Pharrell here.\nNow, every time I see him, which is not often enough, we always have a good conversation like we did before this event. He always gets you to think. Not only is he a world-class talent, but he is a passionate advocate for issues that are too often overlooked and ignored. He wants to -- and I'm going to do everything I can help him -- to deliver -- giving kids who are at risk access to educational and arts programs that they deserve to have just as much as any other child.\nSo tell me this, tell me this, North Carolina, tell me, North Carolina, are you really, really, really happy that we're here tonight?\nWell, we sure are. There's nowhere we'd rather be.Now, let me ask you this, how many of you have already voted?Well, I hope you're going to bring more people to vote as well, right?Are you ready to volunteer?\nWe can all use you in these last days. Are you ready to elect Roy Cooper?\nWell, I'm glad to hear that because it's time you had a governor who puts families first, not radical ideology.And I love seeing our educators stand up and applaud because you need a governor who actually cares about the education of the children of North Carolina.\nNow, are you ready to elect Deborah Ross to the United States Senate? I'll tell you -- I'll tell you, Deborah and her race are the talk of everywhere. People know she will be an independent voice for North Carolina families, that she will represent you with integrity and excellence. And unlike her opponent, she's never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.\nAre you ready now to choose our next president and commander-in- chief?\nWell, I'm -- I'm excited. Did any of you see the debates?Well, you know, there's several -- there's several notable aspects of those debates.\nI mean, one is the very fact that I stood on the stage for four and a half hours with my opponent proving, once and for all, I have the stamina to be president and commander-in-chief.\nBut you know -- but you know, he -- he also kept saying, like oh, well you know, what have you done for the last 30 years? And you know, occasionally I would interject and say what I had done.\nAnd today, in Greenville, we had a perfect comparison. I started my career fighting for children and families with the Children's Defense Fund when I got right out of law school in the 1970's.\nI went to South Carolina to gather evidence to stop the government in South Carolina for -- from putting young men, teenagers in jails with adults. I went to Alabama undercover to gather information about segregated academies to deprive them of tax-exempt status, which they did not deserve.\nI went door-to-door in New Bedford, Massachusetts, gathering information to make the case that every child in America, including children with disabilities, should have the right to a public school education.\nAnd as we heard this morning from a -- just a wonderful, distinguished older woman by the name of Mae Wiggins who came all the way down to tell her story. She was a nurse in New York City back in the 1970's, excited about being a young nurse, getting her career off to a start. And she was looking for a place to live, and she had a budget like everybody does. And she found what she thought would be the perfect place. It was within her budget. It was close to work.\nShe went to apply for an apartment. It was a new building -- brand new building. It wasn't even totally finished yet. She went into the little office and asked for an application and they said, \"Oh, we don't have any apartments.\" She said, \"But I saw the advertisement.\" \"Well, we have no apartments left.\"\nWell, she thought that was pretty peculiar and so she decided to do a little investigation and she found out that all of her African- American friends who had gone to that apartment run by Donald Trump and his father, Fred, had been told there were no apartments.\nSo she had the gumption to go and make a complaint, which led to the Justice Depart-ment suing them for discrimination. They settled the suit, but then they had to come back a year later and sue them again because they were still discriminating.\nSo when you hear, as Bernie so powerfully said at the end of his remarks, that we are standing against the possibility of returning and normalizing discrimination, take it seriously, my friends, because it truly is -- it truly is at stake in this election.\nAnd I was also very, very grateful. I had a role in helping to create the Children's Health Insurance Program as first lady, and let me tell you, one of the great -- one of the great honors as I travel across the country is meeting young people who are the beneficiaries or meeting their families.\nI met a woman here in North Carolina who told her story and we actually recorded it because all of us were so moved by what she had to say when her baby was born. Her daughter, she was deaf. And the doctors all said she'll never -- she'll never communicate, so she cannot learn to speak, so you need to teach her sign language.\nAnd the mom did all this research and concluded that there were some treatments that might help her daughter, but she didn't have that kind of money. They didn't have that kind of insurance. And she was telling her doctor she didn't know what to do, and the doctor just serendipitously said, \"You know, there's this new program, it's called the Children's Health Insurance Program. It's for people who are not poor, but they don't make enough money to afford that kind of insurance, and they don't work for an employer who provides it. You should look into it.\" And she did. And that began the process of her getting the treatment that her daughter needed.\nAnd when I met the mother, I also met the daughter, right here. I talked with her. She told me how proud she was because she had just graduated from college, George Washington University.\nSo, yes, you know, I do sweat the details and I do have a lot of plans. Tim Kaine and I put a whole book out called \"Stronger Together\" telling you exactly what we're going to try to do if we're fortunate enough to be president and vice president because I actually think it's important for you to know what we're going to do together.\nAnd as your -- as a senator, I helped to rebuild New York City after 9/11 and provided health care to our brave first responders. As your secretary of state, I traveled to 112 countries, negotiated cease-fires, reduced the threat of nuclear weapons, stood up for human rights and women's rights and LGBT rights all around the world.\nAnd you know, everything I've done started by listening to people. Listening to hear your stories, what you're worried about, and then working to bring people together to find common ground, even with people who disagreed with me on lots of issues.\nYou know, when I was first lady, I had a great commitment to kids in foster care and I wanted to improve our foster care and adoption laws, and I was looking for some Re-publican to work with me, and I found one because I did my research and found out that one of the most partisan Republicans, Congressman Tom DeLay from Texas, had a heart for children in foster care. He and his wife had fostered children, and I called him up.\nI said, \"Congressman, would you work with me to change the laws on foster care and adoption?\" There was a silence. He said, \"Well, what do you want me to do?\" I said, \"Well, come to the White House. Come to a meeting. We'll sit down and figure out what we can do.\" And we did, and I meet those kids, and I meet those families, kids who were taken out of foster care and given the chance to have a loving permanent family for the first time.\nNow, I'm telling you this because I really believe that's the only way we're going to get things done. And if you elect me next Tuesday, that is the kind of president I will be.\nSo, let me just mention a few of the ideas that we've been putting forward to help you and your families get ahead and stay ahead because I truly believe you need a candidate you can vote for, not just someone to vote against.\nBut as you're making this choice, we need to be clear about what the choice is, because come January 20th, America will have a new president. It will either be me or my opponent.\nNow, I think it's fair to say, things are going to change. Change is part of life. That much is certain. The question is what kind of change are we going to see? Are we going to build a stronger, fairer, better America or are we going to fear each other and fear our future?\nI want you just to imagine, imagine the different kinds of futures that are available depending upon who's elected on January 20th, because by imagining it, I want you to think about every issue you care about, everything that is dear to you, everything that you heard from Pharrell and from Bernie.\nIt's hard for me to imagine that we would have a president who has demeaned women, mocked the disabled, insulted African-Americans and Latinos, pitted people against each other instead of bringing them together. That is, unfortunately though, what we have seen in this campaign, what we have seen, what's been said and how distressful it's been.\nI know there are a lot of people who are upset about what's going on in this campaign, aren't there? People come and talk to me. I've had people say that they can't sleep, that their stomachs are bothering them, they have headaches. And I think that's an im-portant signal because this is a big decision. And as Michelle Obama has said, the presidency doesn't change you -- who you are, it reveals who you are.\nAnd I think it's fair to say that my opponent has already revealed who he is. And he wants to ban every Muslim in the world from coming to the United States. Our country is founded on religious freedom. It is one of the most important building blocks of our democracy.\nHe has said that he thinks the lives of black people are all crime and poverty and des-pair. He has no idea -- no idea about the strength of the black church, the vibrancy of black-owned businesses, the excellence of historically black colleges and universities.\nHe seems not to recognize the rise of a new generation of black activists for social justice and the success of black leaders in every field.\nAnd we saw that again in the way he treated the Central Park Five. These were five black and Latino kids, some as young as 14, who were wrongly convicted of a terrible crime in New York City back in 1990. Donald Trump took out full-page ads in four newspapers calling for the death penalty for these kids. Nearly three decades later, they were exonerated by DNA evidence.\nAnd in addition, someone else confessed to the crime, so they were finally released from prison. But not only did Trump refuse to apologize for what he had said about them and even calling for their executions, he actually said, \"They should still be in prison.\" Evidence didn't matter. The law didn't matter. To him, those kids would always be guilty.\nSo think about it, if he wants to keep exonerated people in jail, how can we trust him to fight for the rule of justice and fairness and criminal justice reform in America?\nDo we want him appointing our judges?\nAudience: No!\nClinton: Do we want him controlling the Justice Department?\nAudience: No!\nClinton: Well, I've said many times, he has shown us who he is, now it is up to us to decide who we are. And right now, people across our country are coming together to do just that. They are rejecting the dark and divisive vision for one that is more hopeful and inclusive. We know that America is big-hearted, not small-minded. We want to lift people up, not tear each other down.\nAnd that's why I do believe we are stronger together, so let me paint you a different picture. Here's what we're going to do together. We're going to take on systemic racism with a full commitment and real follow-through because we refuse to accept as normal some of what we're seeing across America.\nWhat happened to that church in Mississippi yesterday should not have happened and it should never be accepted. People painted the words \"Vote Trump\" on the side and then set it on fire. Who would do that? Who would do that to a place of worship where people seek solace? That can never be normal. It can never be acceptable.\nWhat happened in Flint, Michigan, as Bernie said, can never be normal, can never be acceptable.\nLittle children drinking and bathing in poisoned water that will affect their health for years to come.\nAnd then we know, don't we? Too many young African-Americans are dying in police incidents or because of gun violence.\nWe know their names; Trayvon Martin and Eric Garner and Sandra Bland and Keith Scott and so many others. We have got to face this, and we're going to get to work to do just that. We are going to - we are going to dismantle the so-called school-to-prison pipeline and we're going to replace it with a cradle-to-college pipeline.\nAnd we're going to start with our youngest kids and their families to give them the support that they need. And we're going to take a hard look at what we need to do to make sure every child has the chance to attend good schools with good teachers, no matter what their ZIP code is.\nAnd we will reform our criminal justice system from end-to-end. It is wrong, my friends, that black men are far more likely to be stopped by police, charged and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men for the same offenses.\nWhen I -- when I launched this campaign back in April of 2015, the very first speech I gave was on the topic of criminal justice reform. I said then and I have repeated it throughout this campaign, we must end the era of mass incarceration.\nToo many families have been broken up, too many communities have been so badly affected. We have to reform these mandatory minimums and sentencing. We have to ban the box so people who have served their time can get a real chance at a good job and a fresh start.\nAnd we have to restore trust between police and communities. We are all safer when everyone has respect for the law and everyone is respected by the law.\nThis is important, of course, to families and communities, but it is important to all of us. This is about who we are as a country, about whether we really are a nation that believes in freedom and justice for all. Too often, despite the progress we've made, we fall short of that goal, and we have to be honest about it.\nI am determined to make this one of the most important projects of my presidency and I hope all of you will join me in doing that.\nAnd I have to say - I have to say that is only part of what must be done because the leading cause of death for young African-American men, more than the next nine causes.\nWe have 33,000 people a year dying from guns. I just cannot tolerate this any longer. I have met the families of those who have lost loved ones, who have lost the first graders in Sandy Hook, the bible study churchgoers in Charleston, the club-goers in Orlando, the moviegoers in Aurora, Colorado, people going about their lives being cut down and cut senselessly short. We have to take steps to reduce gun violence, and I know we can do that because the vast majority of Americans agree something must be done and a very big majority of gun owners agree as well.\nAnd we've got to make investments in those communities that are struggling, especially communities of color.\nWhen I was in eastern North Carolina today and I was talking to people there who had been devastated by Hurricane Matthew, people who didn't have very much to start with, who lost everything, farmers with 100, 200 acres growing sweet potatoes, wiped out. We've got to help everybody get ahead.\nI believe that the economy must work for everyone, not just those at the top. And I think hardworking Americans deserve a raise and women deserve equal pay.\nSo, how are we going to do this? Well, we're going to go where the money is. Just as Bernie said, we're going to make the wealthy pay their fair share, and make sure Wall Street never threatens Main Street again.\nAnd I can't wait to work with Bernie to make public colleges and universities like N.C. State right here at Raleigh tuition-free.\nI know that this is another issue Pharrell feels passionately about as well. If you're struggling with student debt, we're going to cut that and help you pay it back and get out from under it.\nAnd in my plan is a $25 billion fund specifically aimed at supporting historically black colleges and universities - schools like Shaw and Saint Augustine - because you know they produce some of the finest leaders in our country, and I want to make sure they keep doing that vital work.\nSo we could go on all night. I mean, Bernie and I could really keep you here until breakfast because we get excited about what we can do. But of course, we can't do anything if you don't get out and vote and get everybody you know to vote.\nThis is going to be one of the most consequential elections in our country's history, you know that, because we are at a crossroads. It's not just who my opponent is. Pharrell is right, we don't even have to mention his name very much. Right? It's not just about him, although there are some special features that certainly raise deep concerns. It's about who we are. It's about what we want, what we're going to do to make our mark on our country at this time in our history.\nI believe -- I believe America's best days are still ahead of us if we do what we're sup-posed to do.\nEvery social movement, every economic advance has only come about because people were willing to work and sacrifice and keep pushing forward in the face of adversity. It's not easy. It wasn't easy to get the vote for women. It wasn't easy to have the final efforts made to ensure that the Civil Rights Act was enforced. It wasn't easy because there are powerful interests still trying to push us back and push us down.\nAnd right now, you know, because in this state a lot of effort was put into trying to suppress the vote, right?\nAnd some people got discouraged about that. I've met some people who say, well, you know, I don't even know what they want, what kind of identification. It gets a little discouraging. You cannot get discouraged. Do not grow weary while doing good, right?\nIt is now our turn -- our turn to stand up to people like your governor and your legislature who wanted to shut you down and push you back because we are fundamentally a good nation and we need to make sure we deliver on that promise.\nAnd in this election, President Obama's entire legacy is on the line, everything that he has worked so hard to do against implacable opposition. As the president said yesterday, everything we've done is dependent upon him being able to pass the baton to somebody who believes in the same things he believes in.\nSo I got to tell you, I've told the president I'm ready to take the baton, but he's going to have to bend over because he's a lot taller than I am.\nBut I'm not just taking it, all of us are taking it. We are ready to grab that baton, to defend and build upon the progress of his presidency, and that is why everyone must vote. Early vote and vote on Tuesday if you can't get to early vote.And listen to this, more than two million right here in North Carolina have already voted.\nSo make no mistake about it, you can make the difference, not only in who you elect, but in the agenda that those people will then get to work on. I want you to hold me accountable. I want you to be my partners, but I can't do any of this.\nYou know, when I was with our wonderful first lady last week, she reminded —she reminded the big crowd we had in Winston-Salem that President Obama in 2008 won this state by about 14,000 votes.\nIf you break that down, you know what the difference between winning and losing is? Roughly two votes per precinct. So don't let anybody tell you their vote doesn't matter. You've got to get everyone you know to come out and vote. You can vote early through this Saturday, November 5th. If you don't know where to vote, go to iwillvote.com to confirm your voting location because the best way to repudiate the bigotry and the bluster and the bullying and the hateful rhetoric and discrimination is to show up with the biggest turnout in American history.\nAnd then that will be the story of this election. Let's make that one for the history books. Please be part of what we're doing in these next days and let's make sure that we not only have a future we can believe in, but one we can help create together, and demonstrate, once and for all, that love trumps hate.\nThank you all.", "timestamp": "2016-11-03", "title": "Remarks at Coastal Credit Union Music Park in Raleigh, North Carolina"}
{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "note": "Remarks as delivered.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119699", "text": "Thank you so much, wow, it is great to be here.\nAnd thank you. I am so honored to be introduced by Mae Wiggins and someone who made such a contribution throughout her life as a nurse to so many people and who, as you can tell, just feels still the pain of being rejected on the basis of her race.\nIt took a lot of courage to come here, Mae. Thank you. Thank you for being with us.\nI also want to thank a long-time friend of mine, a great activist, extraordinary advocate in Congress, and that's U.S. Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton. I want to thank Mayor Allen Thomas for welcoming me here. And either you're all related to him or you think he's doing a good job.\nWell, I told him I want to be a good partner with mayors like him. And work to help communities like Greenville that are growing and striving and attracting young people. He told me that the average age in the residents here in Greenville was 26 years old.\nI also want to acknowledge Josh Stein, candidate for North Carolina attorney general. Patsy Keever, chair of the North Carolina Democratic Party. And State Senator Don Davis.\nAnd I saved the best for last, someone who I've gotten to know over the years; someone who I really look forward to working with. First thing that Congressman Butterfield said to me is \"I have to talk to you about our farmers.\" Very first thing he said. Proceeded to tell me that he was out on a 200-acre sweet potato farm earlier today. We talked about the damage that Hurricane Matthew has done; the lives lost; the homes lost; and also the agricultural damage with all the flooding. And my heart goes out to everyone who has been affected. We've got to be really focused on what we're going to do with this extreme weather. We're getting more of it in more places. And I'm going to make that a priority for my presidency to make sure communities are well prepared. They're resilient. But that we also work to try to limit the damage by taking on the challenge of climate change and changing weather patterns.\nAnd nobody knows more about weather than our farmers. And I am very committed to supporting farms of all sizes, but particularly small farms. You know, I think you said the farm you went to this morning, G.K., was 200 acres. You know, that's a lot of land, but that's not a gigantic multi-thousand-acre farm. And sometimes I think that we spend too much time and money looking after the big, giant farms, and not enough taking care of the smaller farms, the family-owned farms, farms that have been in people's families for generations.\nAnd I will do my very best working with G.K. and Eleanor and others in Congress to focus federal attention and resources on places that need it. And eastern North Carolina is a place that needs it. There are still too many people who feel like they have been left out and left behind. And so we've got to spend time thinking about how we bring everybody along.\nThat is my goal as your president. I want to knock down the barriers that stand in the way of people and places getting ahead. Now also, on a personal note, I was in Arizona last night and had a great rally there. I don't know -- 15,000, 16,000 people. It was just extraordinary. But I was a little anxious during my speech because the Cubs were playing in the World Series.\nAnd, you know, I've been a fan all my life; started watching baseball with my dad; went to Wrigley Field. And, you know, it's been a long time, 108 years, to win a championship and make history. And I only wish that my late father and the great Ernie Banks, Mr. Cub, could have seen it happen. So last night was very special on lots of fronts. And who knows? Maybe we'll see even more history made in a few days. You know, the last time the Cubs won, women couldn't vote. And I think women are making up for that in this election.\nSo thank you. Thank you so much for being here. Are you ready to vote? How many -- how many folks have already voted? [applause]\nWell, that's really impressive. Are you ready to volunteer these last few days? Are you ready to elect Ray Cooper your governor? Have a governor who puts families first and your needs. I know he'll do a terrific job.\nAre you ready to elect Deborah Ross to the United States Senate? She will be the independent voice that North Carolina families deserve. And unlike her opponent, she's never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump. And then, are you ready to elect our next president and commander in chief?\nYou know, did any of you -- any of you see those debates? Well, you know, I spent four-and-a-half hours standing next to Donald Trump, proving conclusively I have the stamina to be the next president and commander in chief.\nBut, you know, he kept saying things like, \"Well, you know, what have you done for 30 years?\" Well, we know what he's done for 30 years, starting with discriminating against African Americans and denying them housing back in the 1970s.\nI chose a different path. I have spent my career fighting for kids and families. And I helped to create the Children's Health Insurance Program as first lady. That now provides healthcare to 8 million children a year. And I have to tell you, I know it doesn't make headlines. It's not going to, you know, get a big Twitter war going, but when I travel around and shake hands like I'll do after my remarks, and somebody says to me, \"The Children's Health Insurance Program saved my son's life.\" I met a woman here in North Carolina whose daughter was born deaf. And the doctor said, \"You know, she's never, ever going to be able to talk; she's not ever going to be able to hear.\" Her mother, who is determined, began doing investigations; she found out that there were some possible treatments. But they were expensive. She didn't know what she was going to do. And she took her daughter to the doctor and the doctor said \"I just heard about this new program, the children's health insurance program. Maybe you can qualify for that.\"\nBecause it's really for families that aren't poor, but don't have much money, and a lot of families isn't it. And families that don't have an employer that provides health insurance, self employed, independent contractors.\nSo, the mom found out about this thing call the children's health program and low and behold they did qualify and they started the treatments for their daughter. I met that young woman, and she said hello to me and she talked to me. She just graduated from college, right here in North Carolina. So don't let anybody tell you, it doesn't matter what you stand for, what you fight for, and who you are trying to help. When you make your decision about who to vote for in this election.\nAs a Senator from New York I worked to rebuild New York City after the 9/11 attacks and to provide healthcare to the brave first responders who ran toward danger not away from it. And many of them—\nAudience: [inaudible]\nClinton: Where you there? God bless you. That's another thing, I meet people all over who were there, and who worked there and I meet people who got sick because they worked there. And as your Secretary of State, I traveled to 112 countries negotiated cease fires, reduced the threat of nuclear weapons, stood up for human rights and women's right and LGBT rights around the world.\nAnd everything I've done, it's because I've been listening to people and again I know that's not very exciting. I plead to that. You spend time listening not talking, you know, what are the poor journalists going to say, \"Uh, there Hillary Clinton was listening again,\" right?\nBut I'll tell you it is what motivates me to hear people's stories, to hear the tribulations and triumphs. You get good ideas. Bring people together; find common ground, even with people we disagree with. I disagree with people on lots of issues, but I believe the only way we can get things done is to actually listen and respect each other, and try to find common that common ground. And that will enable us to get results for people. And if you elect me next Tuesday that is the kind of President I'll be.\nAnd from the first day of this campaign, I've been telling you what I want to do. Putting forth my ideas about what I think will help you. I truly believe that you deserve a candidate that you can vote for, not just someone to vote against. And so if we are gonna make this choice we have got to be clear. The positives and the negatives, because one way or the other, come this January, America is going to have a new President. And it will be either me or Donald Trump.\nAnd you know what else? People say all the time, you know I want change, will come, that is certain. The question is what kind of change are we going to have. Are we going to work together to build a stronger fairer better America, or are we going to fear the future and fear each other and hunker down and be paralyzed by all of our prejudices, our discrimination that stops us from coming together? So, here is what I want you to do in these next days as you talk with people who maybe haven't yet voted, maybe haven't yet made up their mind. I want you to ask them, imagine it is January 20th, 2017 and it is Donald Trump standing in front of the capital taking the Oath of Office.\nImagine what that will be like to have him in the Oval Office, making the decisions that effect your lives and your futures. Imagine having a president who demeans women, mocks the disabled, insults African Americans and Latinos. Who pits people against each other instead of pulling them together. Someone who always puts himself first and doesn't care who gets hurt along the way\nA president with a very thin skin, who lashes out at anyone who challenges him. Who praises adversaries like Vladimir Putin and picks fights with our allies and even attacked the Pope. The truth is we don't have to imagine what that would be like, because everything that Donald Trump has said and done, both in his career and in his campaign, is a preview of what could happen.\nYou know as Michelle Obama says, the presidency doesn't change who you are, it reveals who you are. And we have all see all we need of Donald Trump. If Donald Trump were to win this election, we would have a commander and chief who is completely out of his depth and whose ideas are incredibly dangerous. Someone who wants more countries to have nuclear weapons, and who could easily insult a foreign leader and start a real war instead of just a twitter war. And yet this morning in Florida, Donald stood on a stage and said and I quote \"I am honored to have the greatest temperament that anyone has ever had\". Now -- he knows we can see and hear him, right?\nThis is someone who at another rally, yesterday, actually said out loud to himself, stay on point Donald, Stay on point. His campaign probably put that in the teleprompters, stay on point Donald, stay on point. You know, we have seen it over and over again. We know his true self. His instinct is to say whatever pops into his head, no matter how wrong he is. He can't help himself. So is this someone we want to put in charge of our military?\nIs this someone that we want to treat people the way he has demonstrated, his disrespect throughout this campaign. In a country that values, religious liberty and freedom. Someone who would ban every Muslim in the world from ever coming to our country. Someone who thinks the lives of black people are all crime and poverty and despair. He has no idea, none, about the strength of the black church, the vibrancy of black owned businesses, the excellence of historically black colleges and universities, the rise of a new generation of black activists for social justice and the success of black leaders in every field. Remember how he denied housing to Mae Brown Wiggins. And Mae wasn't alone. Whenever African Americans tried to rent an apartment, their application was marked with a \"C\" -- \"C\" for colored.\nIn fact, Donald, his father Fred and their entire company were sued by the Justice Department for discriminating against African Americans and Latinos in the 1970s. They settled the case, but the Justice Department was forced to go after them again because they continued to discriminate against people of color. Think about that. If he were to win, he would be in charge of the federal housing department. If he doesn't respect all Americans, how can we trust him to serve all Americans?\nAnd then another recent example is the way Donald Trump treated what are called the \"Central Park Five.\" These were five black and Latino kids, some as young as 14. Who, it turns out, were wrongly convicted of a terrible crime in New York back in 1990.\nDonald Trump took out full-page ads in four newspapers calling for the death penalty for these kids. Nearly three decades later, they were exonerated by DNA evidence. Also, someone else confessed to the crime. So they were finally released from prison and justice was done, but not only did Donald Trump refuse to apologize for calling for their execution, he actually said they should still be in prison.\nTo him, those kids will still and always be guilty no matter what the evidence says. Do we want this man appointing judges? Do we want him controlling the Justice Department?\nAudience: No!\nClinton: Well, people who are voting for him, that's what they would get. He has spent this entire campaign offering a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters. He retweets white supremacists and spreads racially tinged conspiracy theories. And you better believe he's being heard loudly and clearly.\nJust a few days ago, and I want you to hear this because this has never happened to a major -- to a nominee of a major party. Just a few days ago, Donald Trump was endorsed by the official newspaper of the Ku Klux Klan.\nThey wrote their endorsement under the slogan of his campaign, \"Make America Great Again.\" They said it's about preserving white identity. And they placed their faith and hope in him. You've got to ask yourself: Do any of us -- any of us who believe in our Constitution, who believe in the rule of law, who believe that we are stronger together, who believe that we want to keep moving positively toward the vision of freedom and equality set forth by our founders -- do any of us have a place in Trump's America?\nIt's not just about communities of color. It's about young people. It's about any of us who don't ever want us to go back to a time when you could officially discriminate; where people could be intimidated. That is not who America is and we're not going to let it ever go back to that.\nBut it doesn't end there. You've also got to ask: Do women and girls have a place either? Imagine our daughters, or in my case now my granddaughter, growing up with someone who ranks women by their looks; gives them numbers and brags about doing things to them without their consent. Just imagine what that would mean to young women's confidence and self-worth. And how that will affect our young men and boys, who we want to teach and nurture also to respect each other and respect girls and women as well.\nSo, this is a pretty clear choice, North Carolina. I've said many times in this campaign that Donald Trump has showed us who he is. Now we have to decide who we are. Right?\nAnd across America, people are doing just that -- rejecting Trump's dark and divisive vision for one that is much more hopeful, inclusive and unifying. We know that America is big-hearted, not small-minded. We want to lift people up, not tear people down.\nWe are called -- we are called. In fact, we are commanded, those of us who are Christians, to love our neighbor as ourselves, aren't we? We are not asked, we are not requested, we are not urged -- we are commanded. And we know how hard that is. When I used to teach Sunday School, I often taught on that, not because it was well known, but because I think it's so hard and challenging.\nLove your neighbor as yourself? Well, first, you've got to love yourself. You've got to respect yourself. And then you have to love your neighbor as yourself. I believe with all my heart that we are better than this. And that's why I want to paint a different picture. Because here's what we're going to do if we win this election. We're going to take on systemic racism with a full commitment and real follow through.\nWe are not going to accept the status quo. What happened to that church in Mississippi yesterday should not be normal. People painted \"vote Trump\" on the side. And then they set it on fire. Who would do that to a house of worship? In America, that can never be acceptable. What happened in Flint, Michigan should not be normal or acceptable -- little babies, toddlers, children drinking water that was poisoning them. And there are too many young African Americans who are dying either in police incidents or from random gun violence. You know their names: Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, Sander Bland, Key Scott. So many. We can't accept that as normal either.\nSo we are going to get to work. I'm just telling you. If I'm fortunate enough to be your president, we're going to roll up our sleeves and get to work, because that's when we're at our best, solving our problems.\nWe're going to dismantle the so-called school-to-prison pipeline and replace it with a cradle-to-career pipeline for every child in this country. I want to make sure that our kids have the chance to thrive with good schools and good teachers no matter what ZIP code they live in.\nWe will reform our criminal justice system from end to end. It is wrong. And I don't care whether you are black or white. It is wrong that black men are far more likely to be stopped by police, charged and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men for the same crimes. It's wrong, and we're going to do something about that. And Donald Trump, whenever he's face with these issues says \"well the answer to our problems is more law and order.\" He doesn't tell you what he means by that, but it's kind of code for fear and division. What I think we need to do, is to work together to restore trust between our police and our communities.\nI think we are all safer when everyone has respect for the law, and everyone is respected by the law. And it's not all, we are going to take common sense steps to reduce gun violence and save lives, because right now, we've got too many people who should not have excess to weapons: the mentally ill, felons, domestic abusers, terrorists. You know, we can't just bow down and say theres nothing we can do, commensurate with the second amendment. Donald's always trying to say \"oh, you know, she's going to repeal the second amendment.\" What nonsense. Absolute nonsense. But I believe we can respect and honor the second amendment, and keep people safer by keeping guns out of the wrong hands.\nAnd we're going to make significant investments in communities that have been let down and left behind. Congressman Butterfield and I were talking about this. There's some good ideas in the Congress to focus on communities, white, black, Latino, Native American, wherever they might be that have been left out. We need to get the engine of economic growth going, because we believe that we should have an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. We believe that we should raise the national minimum wage, because anyone who works full time in poverty should not be mired and left behind. And I think not only do Americans deserve a raise, which Donald doesn't agree with and wanted to eliminate the national minimum wage, I think it's finally time for women to get equal pay for the work we do.\nI don't know about you, but this is not just a women's issue. I'm always accused by Donald and his supporters, that whenever I talk like that, I'm playing the woman's card. Well, I've always said, if that's playing the woman's card, deal me in, you got that right.\nBut I actually think I'm playing the family economics card, because if you have a mother, a wife, a sister or a daughter, she deserves to be paid fairly for what she does in the work force.\nAnd we're going to have a big investments in new jobs, infrastructure jobs, our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports, our water systems. And we're going to do more to bring advanced manufacturing to inner cities and rural communities. Put people to work, doing work that has a really productive purpose. We're going to invest in more clean, renewable energy jobs, these are jobs that cannot be exported, they have to be done right here in eastern North Carolina.\nNow it's fair to say \"Ok, that sounds good, how are you going to do all that?\" Ok, I'll tell you two things. First, I have said, and you can hold me to it, I will not - will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,00 a year. You see, I come from the middle class. My dad never made anything near that, even in those dollars back in those days. But I know that the best way to grow our economy is from the middle out and the bottom up. Not the top down, that does not work for most Americans. And so, secondly, I'm going where the money is. The money has gone to the wealthiest of Americans and big corporations in the last 15 years. And if you ask Donald Trump what is his economic policy? It is to give trillions - trillions of dollars in tax cuts to himself, to his family, to the wealthy, to corporations. I just think that's a bad, bad idea.\nWe're going to make the wealthy pay their fair share, and we're going to make sure Wall Street never threatens Main Street again. And we're going to make public colleges like East Carolina University tuition-free. Tuition-free for working and middle class families, and debt free for everybody else. And if you're struggling with student debt, we have a plan to ease that burden and cut your bills, and get you out from under debt. And we're going to create $25 billion fund specifically aimed at supporting historically black colleges and universities.\nBut I don't think that every young person needs to go college. If you want to, I'm going to make it affordable for you, but if you also want some other way of making a good living, let's bring technical education back into high schools and connect them up with community colleges and business apprenticeships.\nThere is such a stark difference on every issue that matters between me and my opponent, and I'm asking folks who are still making up their minds to really search your heart about what kind of country we are, and what kind of future we want. I just don't believe we're at our best when we stoke fear about each other. Now, that does not mean we have to agree about everything, of course not. But it does mean we have to be willing to listen and to come together to solve problems that affect us individually and as a society.\nI don't think I have all the answers, I don't think anybody does. When Donald Trump at his conventions said he alone could fix everything in America, I thought about our founders meeting in Philadelphia. It wasn't one person creating our country, it was many people working together. Think about every social movement, every economic advance, every university like this one, every achievement that you've made in your own life, somebody helped you. You worked with somebody. Look at this community. Everybody working together, making Greenville really grow and thrive, making this university better and better every single year. That is my experience of America, so here's what I hope you will do. I hope you will get everybody you know, and yourselves , if you haven't voted yet, to vote early. Because the other's strategy is to scare people and intimidate people from going to the polls. Now, Donald Trump's campaign knows that if women turn out, if people of color turn out, if young people turn out, if people who share our vision of a positive unified country, turnout, there's no way he can win, because that is more than half the people in America.\nYou may have noticed that President Obama was in Chapel Hill yesterday. He's coming back to North Carolina tomorrow, because he know how hard it is to get anything done in Washington. As he said yesterday, everything we've done is dependent on him being to pass the baton to somebody who believes in the same things he does. Well I'll tell you what, I'm ready to grab that baton. He's going to have to bend down for me to be able to reach it, because you know he's a tall man. But I've been practicing. I spent four years working with him. I call him my partner and my friend, and I am ready to defend and build on his progress, coming out of his eight years of the presidency.\nSo let's get out and vote, and let's vote for the kind of future that we want, the kind of country that we want. Find your early voting location for the next three days, please, go take people there. We will show once and for all, love trumps hate, thank you all.", "timestamp": "2016-11-03", "title": "Remarks at Pitt Community College in Winterville, North Carolina"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=121445", "text": "Today's Actions include the Designation of 48 National Electric Vehicle Charging Corridors on our Highways\nThe Obama Administration is committed to taking responsible steps to combat climate change, increase access to clean energy technologies, and reduce our dependence on oil. Already, in the past eight years the number of plug-in electric vehicle models has increased from one to more than 20, battery costs have decreased 70 percent, and we have increased the number of electric vehicle charging stations from less than 500 in 2008 to more than 16,000 today – a 40 fold increase. But there is more work to do. That is why, today, the Administration is announcing key steps forward to accelerate the utilization of electric vehicles and the charging infrastructure needed to support them.\nBy working together across the Federal government and with the private sector, we can ensure that electric vehicle drivers have access to charging stations at home, at work, and on the road – creating a new way of thinking about transportation that will drive America forward. Today's announcements demonstrate a continued partnership between the Administration, states, localities, and the private sector to achieve these shared goals:\n•      For the first time, the United State Department of Transportation (DOT) is establishing 48 national electric vehicle charging corridors on our highways, these newly designated electric vehicle routes cover nearly 25,000 miles, in 35 states.\n•      28 states, utilities, vehicle manufactures, and change organizations are committing to accelerate the deployment of electric vehicle charging infrastructure on the DOT's corridors;\n•      24 state and local governments are committing to partner with the Administration and increase the procurement of electric vehicles in their fleets;\n•      The United States Department of Energy (DOE) is conducting two studies to evaluate the optimal national electric vehicle charging deployment scenarios, including along DOT's designated fueling corridors; and\n•      38 new businesses, non-profits, universities, and utilities are signing on to DOE's Workplace Charging Challenge and committing to provide EV charging access for their workforce.\nToday's announcements build on a record of progress from multiple programs across the Administration that work to  scale up EVs and fueling infrastructure, including at the Departments of Energy, Transportation, Defense, the Environmental Protection Agency and with the private sector. This summer, the Administration opened up to $4.5 billion in loan guarantees to support the commercial-scale deployment of innovative electric vehicle charging facilities and in collaboration with the Administration, nearly 50 industry members signed on to the Guiding Principles to Promote Electric Vehicles and Charging Infrastructure. This effort launched the beginning of a collaboration between the government and industry to increase the deployment of EV charging infrastructure that is carried forward in the announcements today.\nADVANCING THE DEPLOYMENT OF ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE ALONG OUR HIGHWAYS\nEstablishing 48 National Electric Vehicle Charging Corridors on our Highways: The U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) today announced 55 Interstates that will serve as the basis for a national network of \"alternative fuel\" corridors spanning 35 states plus the District of Columbia. Today's announcement includes designating 48 out of the 55 routes electric vehicle charging corridors, totaling almost 25,000 miles of electric vehicle routes in 35 states. To make it easier for drivers to identify and locate charging stations, states designated as \"sign-ready\" are authorized to use signs developed by FHWA that identify electric vehicle charging stations and other alternative fuels along the highways similar to existing signage that alerts drivers to gas stations, food, and lodging. Drivers can expect either existing or planned charging stations within every 50 miles.\n28 States, Utilities, Vehicle Manufactures, and Change Organizations Commit to Accelerate Electric Vehicle Deployment on DOT's Corridors: Today, the following organizations are committing to help accelerate the deployment of electric vehicle charging infrastructure along the Alternative Fuel Corridors designated by the U.S. Department of Transportation. These initial and future corridors will serve as a basis for a national network of electric vehicle charging infrastructure to enable coast to coast zero emission mobility on our nation's highways:\n•      Ameren Missouri\n•      Berkshire Hathaway Energy\n•      BMW\n•      ChargePoint\n•      Connecticut Green Bank\n•      Edison Electric Institute\n•      Electric Drive Transportation Association\n•      EV Connect\n•      Eversource Energy\n•      EVgo\n•      General Electric\n•      General Motors\n•      Greenlots\n•      Kansas City Power & Light\n•      MidAmerican Energy Company\n•      New York State\n•      Nissan\n•      NV Energy\n•      Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E)\n•      Pacific Power\n•      PlugShare\n•      Portland General Electric\n•      Public Service Company of New Mexico\n•      Rocky Mountain Power\n•      Skychargers\n•      Southern California Edison\n•      Texas-New Mexico Power\n•      Vision Ridge Partners\nConducting Two Studies to Evaluate the Optimal National EV Charging Deployment Scenarios: Early next year, DOE plans to publish two studies developed with national laboratories and with input from a range of stakeholders to support broad EV charging infrastructure deployment, including along DOT's alternative fuel corridors. The first is a national EV infrastructure analysis that identifies the optimal number of charging stations for different EV market penetration scenarios. The second will provide best practices for EV fast charging installation, including system specifications as well as siting, power availability, and capital and maintenance cost considerations.\nContinuing to Partner with Stakeholders to Build Charging Infrastructure Along the National Charging Corridors: The White House will be convening key stakeholders in November 2016 to continue to encourage state and local governments and businesses to build public electric vehicle charging infrastructure along our national highways.\nSUPPORTING STATE AND LOCAL PARTNERSHIPS TO INCREASE THE ELECTRIC VEHICLES ON THE ROAD\nPartnering with 24 State and Local Governments to Electrify our Vehicle Fleets: Building on the Administration's policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from Federal Fleets by 30 percent by 2025, today, we are announcing twenty-four state and local governments have joined the Federal government to electrify our fleets. These new commitments will account for over 2,500 new electric vehicles in 2017 alone, and help pave a path for a sustained level of purchases into the future. By working together, Federal, state and local leadership can aggregate demand to lower purchase costs through increasing automotive manufactures' demand certainty, promote electric vehicle innovation and adoption and expand our national electric vehicle infrastructure. The cumulative benefit of the commitments announced today include more than one million dollars and 1,211,650 gallons in potential annual fuel savings. These state and local government commitments include:\nStates\n•      California state agencies strive to cut greenhouse gas emissions and since 2010, GHG emissions from state operations have been cut in half. Incorporating zero-emission vehicles (ZEV) into the state fleet is a central component of the state's sustainability strategy. Fulfilling a commitment made by Governor Brown in 2012, more than 10 percent of non-public safety light duty vehicles purchased by the State of California in fiscal years 2014/2015 and 2015/2016 were zero-emission vehicles. In support of the 2016 ZEV Action Plan, the state commits to increasing the number of non-public safety light duty ZEVs to 50 percent by 2025. To reach that goal, the state will target yearly step increases of 5 percent (beginning in fiscal year 2017/2018), over its current 10 percent purchasing commitment.\nØ For 2017, the State of California commits to purchase a minimum of 150 ZEVs for its fleet, bringing the total to over 600 ZEVs in the state fleet.\nØ California commits to providing electric vehicle charging at a minimum of 5 percent of state owned parking spaces by 2020.\n•      Minnesota has developed a fleet action plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that involves transitioning the state's predominately internal combustion engine light fleet to a fleet integrating hybrid electric vehicles; plug-in electric hybrid vehicles; and zero emission vehicles. This plan will decrease petroleum consumption by 25 percent and result in a decrease in GHG emissions of 21 percent. Cost savings for fuel and maintenance is expected to be $2.5 million annually. Minnesota has set its commitment as follows:\nØ Acquire 25 PHEV/ZEVs in Fiscal Year 2017.\nØ Install 15 Level 2 charging stations in Fiscal Year 2017.\nØ Require all new vehicles have EPA ratings of 7 or higher.\nØ Achieve a fleet composition of 20 PHEV or ZEV by 2027.\n•      Montana's State Energy Office commits to swapping out two hybrid vehicles for two plug-in hybrid electric vehicles in 2017. These vehicles will be the first plug-in electric vehicles in Montana's state fleet and will help Montana better understand how electric vehicles can be incorporated into the fleet as well as the charging infrastructure necessary to support these vehicles. Montana commits to reaching out to local governments and universities about opportunities for electrification from the VW settlement allocation.\n•      Rhode Island commits to purchasing 25 percent of new light-duty state vehicles as electric by 2025.\n•      Vermont commits to convert 50 percent of its state motor pool to plug-in electric vehicles by the end of 2017 which far exceeds the previous level of 38 percent. Vermont is also committing to purchase 10 percent of the total State's centralized light duty fleet, including agency and department assigned vehicles, as plug-in electric by the end of 2017 which far exceeds the 7 percent accomplished this year. And to install one dedicated charging port for each of these vehicles at the locations where they are parked and assigned to employees for state trips.\n•      Washington is committed to reducing carbon pollution from the transportation sector and deployment of electric vehicles is a critical element of the governor's climate strategy. Last December, Governor Inslee announced a new Washington State Electric Fleets Initiative to accelerate adoption of electric vehicles in public and private fleets. This initiative will ensure that at least 20 percent of all new annual state passenger vehicle purchases are EVs, beginning in 2017.\no In 2017, Washington State's cabinet agencies commit to purchasing 250 EVs and installing 125 new level 2 charging stations.\nCities\n•      The City of Atlanta has reduced GHG emissions 12.5 percent and fossil fuels by 23 percent since 2008. The City commits to further reducing GHG emissions 40 percent by 2030 through the continued addition of zero emission vehicles and electric infrastructure. The City is encouraging public adoption of electric vehicles and is installing charging stations in 100 dedicated EV parking spaces at the Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta International Airport by the end of 2016. The City commits to convert 20 percent of its municipal fleet to electric vehicles by 2020 through commitments to:\nØ Construct an additional 300 charging stations at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport by the end of 2017.\nØ Spend $3,000 dollars per electric vehicle for infrastructure installation through December 2018.\nØ Conduct an education campaign for City employees about efficient usage of electric vehicles and charging stations.\n•      Columbus, Ohio has long served as a committed pioneer of alternative fuel fleet vehicle adoption.

Thank you!\nAudience members. Obama! Obama! Obama!\nThe President. Thank you. Well, it is good to be back at Florida International University. This is a good-looking crowd here. [Laughter] Can everybody please give Gabby a huge round of applause for her great work? I want to thank—[laughter]—who's screaming here? [Laughter] I want to thank Mayor Philip Levine, who's here. I want to thank Senator Bill Nelson. I want to thank Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. I want to thank your next state senator, Debbie Mucarsel-Powell. Your next Congressman Joe Garcia. And your next United States Senator, Patrick Murphy.\nFlorida, we've got 5 more days. Five more days.\nAudience member. We love you!\nThe President. I love you too. But I've got some business to do here today.\nSo 5 more days to decide the future of this country that we love. Now, the good news is, you don't have to wait until election day to vote.\nWhat does that say up there? I'm sorry, I can't hear you. What does it say up here?\nAudience members. Vote early!\nThe President. You know, I'm still not hearing it. What, what?\nAudience members. Vote early!\nThe President. Vote early! If you are registered, you can vote right now at any early voting location. In fact, there's one just 10 minutes away at the International Mall Branch Library. Go ahead and plug this into your phones if you haven't voted. It is at 10315 NW 12th Street, in Doral. So, I mean, we're making this really simple for you. I am telling you right now where you can go vote after this rally.\nNow, if you are just watching on television or you're not from around here and you're trying to figure out, well, where else could I vote? Then, you go to iwillvote.com, and it will give you additional locations: iwillvote.com. If you're voting by mail, don't let that thing just sit on your coffee table or your kitchen counter, and then you forget about it, it gets mixed up with some other stuff. [Laughter] Send in your ballot right now so it makes it by election day. The point is, we've got work to do to finish what we started 8 years ago.\nNow, I have to say that I've been going to some college campuses, and I realize that, 8 years ago, some of you were 10. [Laughter] Yes, see, she's all, like, \"Yeah!\" [Laughter] Now, that makes me feel a little old. But she says I look good. Okay. All right. Michelle agrees. [Laughter]\nBut I want—for those of you who maybe were a little older and might remember, in 2008, we were living through two long wars, and we were about to enter into the worst economic crisis in the last 80 years. But you know what, because of some hard work, we turned the page. America has now battled back. Last year, incomes rose faster than any time at least since 1968. Poverty fell at the fastest rate at least since 1968. We've created 15 million new jobs. Twenty million people have health insurance that didn't have it. We've kicked our addiction to foreign oil.\nYou know, can I just say, I was driving through North Carolina yesterday—[applause]—North Carolina in the house—and we passed by a gas station. And I don't have to stop usually at the gas station, because the Beast, the motorcade, they're always full. They—Service is taking care of that. But I noticed gas at $1.99. The reason I make this point is because I think in 2008 they were predicting that if Obama got elected, gas would be $6.00. So sometimes, it's useful to check the tape, see what they said before. It turns out what they said was wrong. So what that means is, what they're saying now is probably also wrong. Anyway, I just wanted to do that little detour.\nBut in addition to——\nAudience member. Thanks, Obama!\nThe President. [Laughter] Right, thanks, Obama. Two-dollars-a-gallon gas. Right.\nSo kicked our addiction on foreign oil, doubled our production of clean energy, have done more to battle climate change than any time in our history—we're world leaders on that. We brought home more of our men and women in uniform, took out Usama bin Laden, are systematically rolling up ISIL in Iraq. And by the way, back home, we've made sure that in all 50 States people have the freedom to marry who they love.\nSo there's a reason that I've got gray hair, because I've been busy. And most of all, across these 50 States as I've traveled, what I've seen is the thing that really makes America great.\nAudience member. You!\nThe President. No, it's you. You, you.\nI've seen the American people—people of every party, every faith, every race, every region—people who know we're stronger together. Young, old—young and old folks; men and women; Black, White, Latino, Asian, Native American; folks with disabilities; gay, straight folks—it doesn't matter—all of us pledging allegiance to the red, white, and blue. That's the America I know. That's the America we love. And there is only one candidate in this race who has devoted her life to building up that America, and that is the next President of the United States of America, Hillary Clinton.\nNow, make no mistake, Florida, all the progress we've made goes out the window if we don't win this election. So we've got to work our hearts out this week. We've got to work like our future depends on it, because it actually depends on it. And listen, especially for the young people out there, I know, some of you, this is your first election where you've been paying attention. And you're out there, and you're looking at it, and you're saying, man, this is really nasty. Generally, DC is not so much of a battleground. But down here, it's just like every ad is just depressing. And there's negative ads, and there's noise, and there's distractions. And sometimes, the temptation is to tune it out, and you want to just focus on the Cubs winning the World Series. Which, by the way, even for a White Sox fan, is a pretty big deal. Because they——\nAudience member. South Side! The President. South Side! Because the Cubs have been waiting, like, 108 years. [Laughter] I was watching something on television, and they explained that the last time the Cubs had won, Thomas Edison was alive—[laughter]—and they hadn't invented sliced bread yet. [Laughter] So you know the expression, \"This is the greatest thing since sliced bread\"? This is actually, for Cubs fans, the greatest thing since sliced bread. And I want to congratulate the Chicago Cubs for an amazing season.\nBut it's tempting to want to not really focus on our government and our politics. But this election is critical. And the good news is, once you get past all the noise and all the distractions, and all the okey-doke, the choice could not be clearer, because Donald Trump——\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. Don't boo!\nAudience members. Vote!\nThe President. Don't boo!\nAudience members. Vote!\nThe President. Don't boo!\nAudience members. Vote!\nThe President. Come on, you guys know that. You already knew that. You can't boo. He can't hear you boo, but he can hear you vote. Don't boo, vote.\nDonald Trump is uniquely unqualified to be President. [Laughter] No, I'm not joking. You laugh. I'm not joking. He is temperamentally unfit to be Commander in Chief.\nHere's a guy who says he's a great businessman. But it seems like a lot of his business is built around stiffing small businesses and workers out of what he owes them, work they've done. He thinks it's cute or smart or funny to basically not pay somebody who's done work for him and say, go ahead and sue me because I've got more money than you and you can't do anything about it. It's not fair.\nHere's somebody who, for decades, has refused to release any tax returns. And now maybe it's because he's not as rich as he says is, but he has admitted he does not pay Federal income taxes for years. Not a dime. So he's not helping to support our troops or our veterans. He's not helping to build roads or build schools or help young people finance a college education because he's not putting anything in. He's taken a lot out, but hasn't put anything in.\nHe says that he's going to be his own foreign policy adviser. He says that's because he's got a good brain. Now, I won't opine on the—his brain. What I can say is that anybody who suggests that America should torture people or ban entire religions from entering America or insults POWs or attacks a Gold Star mom——\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. Don't boo.\nAudience members. Vote!\nThe President. Or talks down about our troops, that's not somebody who's fit to be President. Listen, you even have a Republican Senator saying you cannot afford to give the nuclear codes to somebody so erratic. And as Hillary points out, anybody that you can bait with a tweet is not someone you can trust with nuclear weapons. Anybody who is upset about a \"Saturday Night Live\" skit—[laughter]—you don't want in charge of nuclear weapons. No, I'm serious. This is a guy who, like, tweets they should cancel \"Saturday Night Live,\" I don't like how Alec Baldwin's imitating me. Really? I mean, that's the thing that bothers you, and you want to be President of the United States? Come on, man. Come on. Can't do it.\nNow, I think the thing—but you know what, we have to be honest. He's got support here in Florida. He's got some support around the country. No, he does. If he didn't, then I wouldn't have to go around getting everybody to vote. [Laughter] He's got some support.\nAnd the most frustrating thing is, some of his support is coming from working folks. People say, well, you know, he's going to be our voice. Are you serious? This is a guy who spent 70 years, his whole life, born with a silver spoon, showing no respect for working people. He's spent a lot of time with celebrities, spends a lot of time hanging out with the really wealthy folk. But you don't see him hanging out with working people unless they're cleaning his room or mowing the fairways on his golf club. You're going to make this guy your champion if you're a working person? Come on.\nSomebody who spent his life without ever showing any regard for working folks. But he has insulted minorities and immigrants and Muslims and Americans with disabilities. That's the voice you want?\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. You want a voice who's bragging about how being famous lets you get away with what would qualify as sexual assault and calls women pigs and dogs and slobs? And when he pays attention to women, it's because he's grading them on a scale of one to ten. What kind of message are we sending if that's our voice?\nI tell you what, we're going to teach our kids—I want to teach all American kids—that our diversity is our strength; that, in America, it's not about what you look like, but who you are and what you do and what your character is; that women are not just full and equal citizens, they may be a lot more capable of doing what a man can do.\nBut the problem is that he has said so much stuff, and our culture and our media has just gotten so reality-TV-ized. [Laughter] I know that's not a word. [Laughter] But you get my drift. It's become normal when somebody just says wacky stuff. As long as they're famous, we think it's okay. I mean, and you hear people justifying it. They're all, like, well, you know, he may be—that's just locker room talk; or I don't really like what he's saying, but as long as he supports Republican policies and he cuts taxes for the wealthy, that's what I care about—saying character doesn't matter.\nLet me tell you something about this office that I've been in for 8 years. Who you are, what you are does not change after you occupy the Oval Office. All it does is magnify who you are. All it does is shine a spotlight on who you are. If you disrespected women before you were in office, you will disrespect women as President. If you accept the support of Klan sympathizers before you are President, you will accept their support after you're President. If you disrespect the Constitution before you're President and threaten to shut down the press when it says something you don't like or threaten to throw your opponent in jail in a live Presidential debate without any regard for due process; if you discriminate against people of different faiths before you are President, then that is what you will do in office, except you will have more power to carry out the twisted notions that you had before you were in office.\nSo you can't make excuses for this stuff. This isn't a joke. This isn't \"Survivor.\" This isn't \"The Bachelorette.\" This counts. This has to do with what's going to happen in your family, in your community, to soldiers and veterans, the safety of our kids.\nListen, we—I am a strong Democrat, but I tell you what. We aren't born Democrats or Republicans. We're Americans first. And I have good friends who are Republicans. And I know they don't think this way about women. They don't think this way about Muslims. They don't think this way about immigrants. This is—what they are doing is something different entirely. It is different from what we have seen before.\nAnd the good news is, all of you are uniquely qualified to make sure that this uniquely unqualified person does not become President. And all you've got to do is make sure that you go out there and you vote.\nAnd the other good news is, you don't just have to vote against this guy, because you have a candidate who's actually worthy of your vote. Somebody who is smart, somebody who is steady, somebody who is tested—perhaps the most qualified person ever to run for this office—our next President, Hillary Clinton.\nThis is somebody who has dedicated her life to making this country better. Think about how she got her start. While Donald Trump and his developer dad were being sued by the Justice Department for denying housing to African American families, Hillary was going undercover from school to school to make sure minority kids were getting an equal shot at a good education.\nShe has not stopped fighting for justice, fighting for equality ever since. Her heart's always been in the right place. Works hard every single day. I know. She worked hard when she was running against me. [Laughter] I was worn out. She worked hard when she was working for me. She was there in the Situation Room as my Secretary of State, making the argument to go after bin Laden even when it was risky; circled the globe as Secretary of State; earned the respect of world leaders.\nHer efforts weren't always flashy. They weren't always fully appreciated, which is true for a lot of the work that women do, by the way. Just want to make that observation. She made me a better President. She understands policy. She understands how the world works. She understands that this stuff that we do, the challenges we face aren't abstract. They mean something to real people.\nShe knows that she's got to work hard because you are out there working hard. And by the way, she doesn't whine or complain or blame others or suggest everything is rigged when things aren't going her way. She just works harder. She just comes back better. Because she knows no matter how hard things may be for her, there are a lot of people who are having an even tougher time trying to pay the bills or trying to find a job or trying to finance a college education. So she doesn't have time to whine. She just gets up and does the work.\nAnd she knows the decisions you make as President mean something to that soldier or that veteran or our military families; that a parent who's trying to make ends meet, they need a President who cares and knows what they're doing; that a student trying to go to college for the first time needs somebody with an actual plan to help them; that a young person who was brought to this country as a child, has never known another country, is American by every standard except they don't have a piece of paper. She knows they need to have a chance to get back to this country they love.\nShe's got plans that will actually help these people. She's going to be a leader who actually values hard work, respects working Americans. And she will be an outstanding Commander in Chief because she's been in the room when tough decisions were made.\nYou worried about keeping America safe? She'll do it. Because she knows our military and knows our diplomats. She doesn't just talk about it. She doesn't play one on TV. [Laughter] She's been there. She will be a smart, steady President for the United States.\nAnd the one thing I've got to remind you, though, is she's not going to do it alone. That's why we've got to have a Congress that is also focused on you. Patrick Murphy, he's got the same values Hillary does. Unlike his opponent, Marco Rubio, Patrick——\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. Don't boo. What are you supposed to do?\nAudience members. Vote!\nThe President. Come on. Unlike his opponent Marco Rubio, Patrick actually shows up to work. He puts you ahead of politics. He didn't try to defund Planned Parenthood. He didn't think that somehow some politicians should be making decisions. He said, let women make their own health care decisions. He didn't walk away from Florida's Latino community when the politics got tough. He kept on. Patrick kept on fighting for comprehensive immigration reform and a pathway to citizenship.\nHe actually believes in science and, as a consequence, believes climate change is a problem for the people of Florida and that we should do something about it. Patrick Murphy brought Democrats and Republicans together to fund Everglades restoration. He has a track record of caring about the environment. As your next Senator, he and Hillary will help protect this planet for our kids and help make sure that Florida is protected against some of the worst consequences of climate change. This should be a no-brainer.\nAnd there's one other big difference between Patrick and Marco: Marco supports Donald Trump. Now, keep in mind, earlier this year, he called Donald a \"dangerous con artist.\" He said that Donald Trump has \"spent a career sticking it to working people.\" And then, he tweeted—this is Marco Rubio—he tweeted, \"Friends don't let friends vote for con artists.\" [Laughter] So guess who just voted for Donald Trump a few days ago? Marco Rubio. Obviously, he did not have good enough friends to—[laughter].\nListen, but this tells you something. This tells you something. Now, if you knew better when you were running against Trump, you knew he was a con artist, spent a lot of time sticking it to working people—this is what you said. I mean, I'm not making this up, right? I just want to be clear. He said this. It's quoted, taped, right? If you knew better and then you went ahead and voted for this guy anyway and supported this guy anyway, that means you are somebody who will say anything or be anything, be anybody just so you can get elected or cling to power.\nAnd you know what, if that's the kind of person you want representing you, I guess you should vote for Marco Rubio. But if you want a Senator who will show up and work for you and has some integrity and has some consistency and will actually say what he thinks and what he means and then act on that, somebody you have confidence in, then you should vote for Patrick Murphy. I trust Patrick Murphy. I believe in Patrick Murphy. And Hillary needs Patrick Murphy in the United States Senate to make sure she gets done what she gets done.\nSo part of the reason that it's important to get Patrick in, part of what I want to say about this election is this is about more than just plans, policies. There's something more fundamental at stake. What's at stake is the character of our Nation. You know, when Hillary was young, her mom taught her the Methodist creed: Do all you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways that you can, for as long as you can. That's what guides her. That's her north star. She believes that we can summon the best in this country and make it better for all people, not just some. That's what America is all about, isn't it?\nWe're a country like no other, not because of the height of our skyscrapers, not because of the size of our military. It's because this is a place founded on an idea: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are created equal; that we're all endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights. Where you don't have to be born to wealth or privilege. You don't have to have a certain last name or look a certain way or do your hair a certain style. You've just got to be willing to contribute. You've just got to be willing to work. You've just got to care enough about other people and making sure everybody has got a fair shot. And if you do that—if you do that—then you're a patriot, and you can contribute to this country that you love. And you can go as far as your dreams can take you. That's what makes this place special.\nThat's what drove patriots to choose revolution over tyranny; to found this Nation. And that's what led GIs to liberate a continent. That's what led women to march to get the ballot. That's what led marchers to cross a bridge in Selma to win their rights. That's what allowed workers to organize for collective bargaining and better wages. That's what's made America exceptional. That's what's always made America great. We've never been about just doing for ourselves. It's been about what we can do together.\nIt's about what can be achieved by us, the people, together, through the hard, slow, and yes, sometimes frustrating work of self-government. That's not what Donald Trump stands for, but it is what Hillary stands for: the idea that in this big, diverse country of ours, we don't demonize each other. We reach out and try to work together. We recognize that issues aren't always black and white and sometimes you got to compromise even when you are right. She knows none of us are perfect, but she knows that those of us who have been blessed with positions of leadership should try to conduct ourselves with the sense of decency and big-heartedness that can set an example for our kids.\nAnd I know Hillary will do that. I know she will continue the progress we've made. And she'll need allies like Patrick, because we can't just have Hillary stuck with a Republican Congress that behaves the way they've been behaving. You know, they haven't worked with me since I've been in office. They didn't work with me when we were about to go into a Great Depression. Even now, they control the Senate and the House, and they can't pass their own stuff. [Laughter] They're so accustomed to just saying no, obstruction, gridlock, \"we're against whatever it is the—that Obama proposes.\"\nI will sometimes propose their own stuff, and they'll oppose it. [Laughter] It surprises them. I'll be, like, well, this is in your Republican handbook; this is in your talking points. I thought you all were for this. No, but you're for it now, we can't be for that. I'm sorry. [Laughter]\nAudience member. Come on, man!\nThe President. Come on, man! [Laughter] So they've—so apparently, they don't have much confidence in their nominee. So instead, they're already promising more unprecedented dysfunction in Washington. Now, it's hard to promise more dysfunction, right? [Laughter] I mean, that's a hard thing to do. But they're promising that. They're promising \"years\" of investigation, \"years\" of hearings, \"years\" of shutdown, \"years\" of obstruction, \"years\" of repeal Obamacare votes.\nCan I just say, by the way, let me—I'm going to take another aside. I know I'm running long, but I'm—[applause]. But we have given 20 million people have health insurance that didn't have it before. Twenty million people. The parade of horribles the Republicans have talked about haven't happened. Death panels, you remember that? [Laughter] Saying this would bankrupt the country. None of what they've said has happened. So now, after 60 votes to repeal this thing they haven't succeeded, Donald Trump said we've got to call a special session to repeal it. And he had a big press conference, and he had a couple of doctors and a nurse and Ben Carson and some people—[laughter]—no, no—who's an excellent neurosurgeon. He really is. I don't know what happened on the political thing, but—[laughter].\nSo they come, and they spend like an hour—\"Oh, we're going to repeal Obamacare.\" Okay, and then what you going do? \"Well, then we're going to repeal it, and we're going to give you something great.\" Okay, what? \"Well, something.\" [Laughter] Because premiums are going up. Well, now, it is true, premiums are going up for a handful of people who don't get tax credits—that's important. We're going to work as hard as we can to do something about it. We would have already done it if the Republicans had helped. But keep in mind, their alternative would have been no health insurance; that's what they had before.\nSo I—so the reason I pointed this out was you watch the press conference and what you realized is, they've got no plan. [Laughter] They want to repeal because, ideologically, they're opposed to the idea of helping these 20 million people get health insurance. It's not like—they don't even have a pretense of a plan. They don't even have a semblance of a plan. There's not even a hint of a plan, not even a mote, not even a—there's no plan. [Laughter] Nothing. Zero. Nada. Come on!\nYou can't just be against something, you've got to be for something. You can't spend 8 years being against me, and now you're going to be against Hillary. But you haven't been for anything. Come on! Now you've got some of these Senators who are talking about how we won't even appoint another Supreme Court justice. Now, we've had nine Supreme Court Justices for a really long time. And part of the reason you have nine is to break ties. And some of the same folks who just a while back said, well, we can't have hearings and vote for the guy Obama nominated because we're so close to the election, we should let the next President make the nomination. Right? That's what they said.\nSo now, they think Hillary might win, they say, well, we might block hers too. Wait, but I thought you said that the people were going to decide. Can I talk to the press for a second? [Laughter] What happened? Do we ever run back the tape? Do we ever, kind of, go, well, what happened? That's what they said, and now they're saying something entirely different. Come on, man! This has got to be on the level. Don't pretend like gridlock is happening because somehow Democrats and Republicans are equally obstructionist. It's just not true.\nYou've got some Republicans right now who are suggesting they will impeach Hillary. They don't necessarily know why, but they're just going to impeach her. [Laughter] Imagine if you had sitting Democratic Senators saying that about Donald Trump, before he was even elected, saying, we—he will be impeached. But look, nobody likes gridlock. But gridlock is not something mysterious that descends like a fog on Washington. Gridlock isn't happening because both sides are doing bad things and both sides are corrupt. That's not what's going on. Gridlock happens purposely when Republican politicians like Marco Rubio decide they will do anything to oppose anything good for the country if a Democratic President proposes it. And that's now Marco Rubio's campaign platform: gridlock.\nIf you think \"Vote for gridlock\" is a good slogan, you should vote for Republicans. But if you believe America can do better, if you think we should be doing something to create jobs for working families, if you think we should be providing health care for folks who need it, if you think we should be helping single moms with childcare so they can go to the job, if you think we should have equal pay for equal work or raise the minimum wage, then you need to vote for Democrats up and down the ticket. You've got to vote for Hillary and Patrick, people who will roll up their sleeves and move this country forward.\nAll right. I've gone on too long.\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. I have. I know I've gone on a little too long. I've got to—my staff is going to talk about me when I get back there. [Laughter] They'll say, what was going on? You're just—you're talking too long. [Laughter]\nSo let me end with this. Let's take it down for a second, because I want to make this point to young people especially. Just give me one second. Just give me one second.\nYou know, I know a lot of you are cynical about politics. There's a lot about this election that gives you reason to be. But I'm here to tell you, right now you have a chance to move history in a better direction. You have a chance to reject divisive politics and mean-spirited politics. You have a chance to elect a leader who has spent her entire life trying to move this country forward, the first female President, who can be an example for our sons and our daughters. You have the chance to shape history, and I want young people to understand, those moments don't come that often.\nYou know, there are times where history is movable, where you can make things better or worse. This is one of those moments. And it's in your hands. This incredible power that each of you have. I know you care about a lot of issues, young people. I've heard from you. I've heard—I've seen you march for criminal justice reform. That's great. But if you care about criminal justice reform, it's not just enough to protest. You've also got to vote for a President and Congress and prosecutors who care about disrupting that pipeline of underfunded schools to overcrowded jails and make sure that the criminal justice system is accountable and fair.\nI know that there are a lot of young people who care about the environment and climate change. I've heard you. But you've got to have a President and a Congress who believes in science and who cares about climate change and who will protect the progress we've made and want to leave a better planet for our kids.\nIf you've been working on immigration reform, I've been working too. But if we're going to finish the job, you've got to have a President and a Congress who sees in immigrants not criminals or rapists, but people who have the same dreams and aspirations and who care about this country and who want to contribute and give back to it.\nMy point is, your vote matters. It's because of you that 20 million people have health insurance that didn't have it. It's because of you that there are young people who got Pell grants and could go to college who couldn't before. It's because of you that a marine can serve his country without hiding the husband that he loves. It's because of you that young DREAMers have been able to come out of the shadows and are serving our country and are going to school. It's because of you that we made this progress.\nSo, Florida, and young people especially, I'm asking you to—the same thing I asked of you 8 years ago. I'm asking you to believe, not just in my ability to change things, one person's ability to change things even. I'm not just asking you to believe in Hillary's ability to change things. I'm asking you to believe in your ability to change things.\nMy—you remember my slogan wasn't \"Yes, I can.\" It was \"Yes, we can.\" And I'm not on the ballot this time. But fairness is on the ballot. Decency is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot. All the progress we've made is on the ballot. Immigration reform is on the ballot. A higher minimum wage is on the ballot. Equal pay for equal work is on the ballot. Democracy is on the ballot. Hillary Clinton will move us forward if you give her a chance. And if we win Florida, we will win this election. It is in your hands.\nSo go out there and vote. Get your friends to vote. Get your family to vote. Get your cousins and neighbors and coworkers to vote. Tell them that this is the moment where America makes a stand about who we are and what we believe. Tell them this is the moment we reject cynicism and reject fear. This is the moment we choose hope. Choose hope. Choose hope. Choose hope.\nGo out there and vote. And if you do, we will elect Hillary Clinton the next President. We'll elect Patrick Murphy the next Senator. We'll continue this amazing journey. We will finish what we started. We will show the world why America is the greatest nation on Earth. I love you guys.

First of all, your outstanding senior Senator, Bill Nelson, is in the house. And your next United States Senator, Patrick Murphy, is in the house.\nFive days, Florida. Five days. Five days to decide the future of America. Now, the good news is, you don't have to wait 5 days, because if you're registered, you can vote right now at any early voting location. In fact, there's just—there's an early voting location just 10 minutes away at the Southeast Regional Library. I will give you the address: 10599 Deerwood Park Boulevard. You can go to iwillvote.com to find other locations. If you're voting by mail, don't let your ballot sit on your coffee table, on your kitchen table, get all mixed up with all the other stuff you've got up in there. Mail in your ballot so it makes it in by election day.\nWe've got to finish what we started, and in order to do that, you've got to do what? What does that say?\nAudience members. Vote early!\nThe President. I'm sorry, what does it say?\nAudience members. Vote early!\nThe President. I still can't hear you.\nAudience members. Vote early!\nThe President. I like that. I heard you, pep band. I heard that pep band playing a little bit. Appreciate you, guys.\nNow, you know, as I'm traveling around college campuses, I start talking about what happened 8 years ago, I realize, some of you all were 10 years old—[laughter]—which makes me feel somewhat old.\nAudience member. [Inaudible]\nThe President. There's one right there, huh? So for those of you who were more focused on Nickelodeon—[laughter]—back in 2008, we were living through two long wars. We were in the early days of what would turn out to be the worst economic crisis in 80 years. But we fought back, and we put in some policies that made sense. And today, we've seen that not only have we averted a Great Depression, but last year, we saw incomes rising faster than any time since 1968. We saw poverty falling at the fastest pace since 1968. We've created 15 million new jobs. Twenty million people have health insurance who didn't have it.\nWe've kicked our addiction to foreign oil. And by the way, back then when I was running, folks said if you elect Obama, gas is going to be $6 a gallon. I just want to point out, $2 ain't bad. Two dollars. Two. [Laughter]\nMeanwhile, we've doubled our production of clean energy. We've become the world's leader in fighting against climate change.\nOn the international stage, we're in the process of taking out ISIL. We've brought our men and women home from Iraq and Afghanistan. We took out Usama bin Laden. We're more respected around the world.\nWe've restored the civil rights mission and voting rights in the Justice Department. We've helped to make sure that in all 50 States, people have the freedom to marry who they love. We have been busy, which is why I've got gray hair. I've been working hard.\nAudience member. You look good!\nThe President. That's what Michelle says—[laughter]—says I still look good.\nBut you know what, none of this would have happened if it weren't for America's greatest asset, and that is you, the American people.\nI've seen all of you all across 50 States. People of every faith and every party and people of every background—young, old; men, women; Black, White, Hispanic, Asian, Native American; folks with disabilities; gay, straight—all of them pledging allegiance to the red, white, and blue; all of them understanding that we are stronger when we are together. And I'm here to tell you, Florida, that there's only one candidate in this race who has devoted her entire life to that better America, and that is the next President of the United States, Hillary Clinton.\nNow, that's the right choice. But I am also here to tell you that this will be a close race and you cannot take it for granted. Because all the progress we've made these last 8 years goes out the window if we don't win this election. So we've got to work our hearts out in the next 5 days. We have to work like our future depends on it, because you know what? Our future depends on it.\nAnd I know that here in Florida, you're just inundated with negative ads and there's so much noise and so much distraction. And sometimes, it can be encouraging—discouraging. But I want you to tune that out, and I want you to focus on the real choice in this election, because the actual choice could not be clearer.\nDonald Trump is uniquely unqualified to be President. Donald Trump is temperamentally unfit to be Commander in Chief. He claims to be a great businessman. [Laughter]\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. Don't boo!\nAudience members. Vote!\nThe President. Don't boo!\nAudience members. Vote! The President. Don't boo!\nAudience members. Vote!\nThe President. He can't hear your boos, but he can hear your votes.\nNow, as we were driving over here, I noticed there was a headline about Trump Towers in Toronto in Canada going bust. Opened it 4 years ago, suddenly, it's already up—belly up.\nAudience member. [Inaudible]\nThe President. But—I've got some business to do here, hold on one second. Don't worry, I see you. But I've got some business to do. Hold on.\nNow, what I know of really great businesspeople, they're people who build great products and provide great services, but also they treat their workers well and their contractors well. If you're somebody who's repeatedly stiffed small businesses that did work for you, stiffed workers out of what you owed them just because you could, that's not my definition of a great businessman.\nThis is the only candidate in decades who's refused to show his tax returns. Now, it may be because he doesn't have as much money as he says he does. I mean, he likes bragging, but maybe he can't back it up. But it may also be because it turns out, he hasn't paid income taxes in years, which means not a dime to help support our troops; not a dime to help support our veterans; not a dime to help universities educate young people; not a dime to help rebuild our roads and our bridges and put people back to work; not a dime to do all the things that would help make America for the next generation as great as it's been for this generation.\nHe says he thinks that's a sign that he's a smart businessman. But if you've been given so much and you give back so little, that's not a sign of a good businessman to me. That sounds to me like somebody who doesn't deserve to be President of the United States.\nNow, he says that he will be his own foreign policy adviser. [Laughter] He says that he can do that because he has a good brain. [Laughter] That's what he said. But we can't afford a President who suggests that it's okay for America to torture people or bans entire religions from our country or insults POWs or attacks Gold Star moms or talks down to our troops. Even a Republican Senator said we can't afford to give the nuclear codes to somebody that erratic. That's a Republican. As Hillary said, a man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. Somebody who gets fired up and riled up about a \"Saturday Night Live\" skit—[laughter]—is not somebody you want to trust with nuclear weapons.\nBut you know the thing that really gets me is this notion that he's going to be a voice for working people. Now, what's—and look, let's face it, I mean, he's got some support right here in Florida. He's got support around the country, in some cases, from working folks. And I just want to talk to them and say, hey, guys, this—here's a guy who has spent 70 years on this Earth showing no respect for working people. He's spent all his time trying to hang out with rich people and celebrities. He's not somebody who's gone around working to make sure people's wages are higher, working to make sure that unions get a better deal on collective bargaining. He's not somebody who's spending a lot of time with folks who are struggling paycheck to paycheck, unless it's somebody cleaning in one of his buildings or somebody mowing one of his fairways.\nSo how can he be a champion for working people? Is that somebody who you want as your voice? Look—— Audience members. No!\nThe President. Do you want somebody who makes fun of people with disabilities?\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. Or vilifies minorities or immigrants?\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. Do you want somebody to be your voice who brags about how being famous allows him to get away with what is defined as sexual assault?\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. And calls women pigs and dogs and slobs and grades them on a 1-to-10 scale?\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. I have been blessed with two daughters who are magnificent. They are magnificent because my wife is magnificent. And we teach our kids to treat everybody with respect; that diversity is a strength; that you're measured not by putting other people down, but by how many people you can lift up. We teach our daughters that women are full and equal citizens, capable of doing anything a man does a little better. That's the lesson we impart to our children. I'll bet that's the lesson you're trying to impart to your children.\nAnd so you hear what Mr. Trump says, and the problem is that it's been happening so frequently that we've become numb to it. We almost act like it's normal. We almost treat this like some reality TV show. You know one of those shows where they've got to bleep out every few sentences because folks are just acting crazy and saying crazy stuff and being mean and just to manufacture some drama so you can collect more ratings? That is how we are treating this election for the most powerful office on Earth: as if it's normal. We've become numb to it. And it's not. It's not. It's not acceptable. It's not normal. You can't make an excuse for it. You can't pretend it's not happening.\nAnd when you talk to some folks who are voting for Trump, they'll say, \"Well, you know, he doesn't really mean it\" or \"It's just locker-room talk.\" They try to justify it or excuse it. Or in some cases, they say, \"Yes, that's really terrible, but as long as he supports tax cuts for the wealthy, as long as he supports my agenda, I'm going to go ahead and support him anyway.\"\nBut I want to tell you about this office that I've been in, the Presidency. I want—[applause]—no, no, I want you to understand. Who you are, what you are, it doesn't change after you occupy the Oval Office. It magnifies who you are. It shines a spotlight on who you are. Because you have more authority, you can act on who you are.\nSo if you disrespect women before you take office, you'll disrespect women when you're in office. If you accept the support of Klan sympathizers before you're in office, you'll accept their support while in office. If you disrespect the Constitution when you're running for office and you threaten to shut down the press if they say something you don't like or you threaten in a Presidential debate to throw your opponent in jail or you discriminate against people of different faiths, then that's what you'll do in office.\nAnd the reason I want everybody to focus on this is, you know, I'm a proud Democrat, but we—[applause]—no, no, hold on. We are not Democrats or Republicans first. We are children of God. We are human beings. We are Americans first. And I have good Republican friends who don't act or think the way Trump does.\nWhen I ran in '08, I ran against John McCain and disagreed with him on a whole bunch of stuff, but I didn't fear for the Republic. I just thought I would be a better President. When I ran against Mitt Romney in 2012, I disagreed with him on all kinds of things. But although I thought I was going to be a better President, I did not think that our democracy would be injured by him taking office.\nThis is different. This is somebody who would do damage to our democracy, who is uniquely unqualified and shows no interest in becoming more qualified. And the good news is, Florida, all of you are uniquely qualified to make sure he doesn't get the job.\nBut you've got to vote. You've got to vote. And you don't have to just vote against something, you can vote for something. Because there's a candidate in this race who's actually worthy of your vote: somebody who is smart, somebody who is steady, somebody who is tested, maybe the most qualified person to ever run for this office—and that is our next President, Hillary Clinton.\nNow, this is somebody who has dedicated her life to making this country better. If you think about how she got started, while Donald Trump and his developer dad were being sued by the Justice Department for denying housing to African American families, at the same time, Hillary was going undercover from school to school to make sure minority kids were getting an equal shot at a good education. And her entire life has been about fighting for justice and equality.\nHer heart has always been in the right place. She works hard every single day. I know. She worked hard in 2008 when we were running against each other. [Laughter] And then, I saw how good she was, and I said, come work with me. And she then worked as Secretary of State. She was in the Situation Room making arguments to go after bin Laden when it was risky; circling the globe again and again as Secretary of State, earning the respect of leaders around the world. She did an outstanding job.\nHer efforts were not always flashy. They were not always appreciated here at home. But she did the work, and she did it well. She made me a better President. She paid her dues. She understands the world, understands the challenges we face. When things don't go her way, she doesn't pout, she doesn't whine, she doesn't complain. She doesn't blame somebody else. She doesn't say——\nAudience member. It's rigged!\nThe President. ——it's rigged. She just works harder, comes back stronger.\nBut most importantly, she knows what this job is about. This job is not about puffing yourself up. This job is about you. This job is about working for you. She knows what the decisions you make in the Oval Office mean to a single mom who's trying to figure out how to get childcare she can afford. She understands what it means to a soldier whether his family is going to get support while he's overseas. He—she understands that it means something to students who are trying to go to college for the first time and whether they're going to be able to afford it or not; that the decisions you make will affect some young person who may have been brought to this country as a tot.\nThis is the only country they've ever known and now just want to contribute to the only place they know. She understands that because she's been with you. She's listened to you. She's heard you. She's fought for you. She knows ordinary folks need a champion. And she's put together plans that actually help. You can go on her website. It's full of plans, full of details, full of how to pay for it. She's done her homework. And she values hard work, and she respects working families. She'll be a Commander in Chief who will finish the job of defeating ISIL. She will be a smart, and she will be steady.\nAnd so the question is, if you've got one person who you know is not qualified and you've got another person who is eminently qualified, the only thing that's left to do is vote. [Applause] The only thing left to do is vote!\nAnd by the way, when you vote, you're not just voting for President, you're also voting to make sure there are people who can help Hillary do a better job. That is why you've got to make sure that when you vote, you vote for Patrick Murphy for U.S. Senate.\nUnlike his opponent Marco Rubio, Patrick actually shows up to work. He puts you ahead of politics. He didn't try to defund Planned Parenthood; he fought to make sure women can make their own health care decisions. He didn't walk away from immigration reform when the politics got tough; he fought for immigration reform and a pathway to citizenship. Unlike his opponent, he actually believes in science—[laughter]—believes that climate change is something we should do something about; fought to restore the Everglades; brought Democrats and Republicans together; and as your next Senator, he will work with Hillary to protect this planet for our children. And unlike Marco Rubio, he doesn't support Donald Trump.\nNow, there was a time when Marco didn't sound like he supported Donald Trump. Earlier this year, he called Donald Trump \"dangerous,\" a \"con artist.\" Said Donald Trump had \"spent a career sticking it to working people.\" Sounds about right. [Laughter] Marco Rubio tweeted, \"Friends don't let friends vote for con artists.\" Guess who Marco Rubio just voted for a few days ago: Donald Trump. Which means he didn't have any good friends. [Laughter] But what it also means is, here is somebody who knows better but decided it's politically expedient to support somebody who you know is not qualified. And that is a problem.\nLook, if you're looking for a Senator who will say anything or be anybody just to hang on to power or get elected, then you should vote for Marco Rubio. But if you want a Senator who's going to stand up for you and work for you and show up to work for you, you need to vote for Patrick Murphy so he can stand alongside Hillary Clinton and move this country forward.\nSo look, the point is, there is something more fundamental at stake in this election than just plans or policies. What's at issue is the character of this Nation. Hillary Clinton tells me that her mom taught her the Methodist creed: Do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, as long as you can. And that's what she's done. That's what she's tried to live by. She believes we can summon what's best in each of us, make the country better for all of us. And that's what America is about. That's the country we love.\nWe are unlike any other nation not because of the size of our military or our wealth or our power. It's because this is a place founded for the sake of an idea: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal; that we are endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights.\" You don't have to be born into wealth or privilege. You don't have to look a certain way or have a certain last name or practice a certain faith. If you are willing to contribute, if you are willing to work hard, if you do the right thing, you can put your shoulder to the wheel of history. You can make a difference. You can live out your dreams. That's what drove patriots to choose revolution over tyranny. That is what led our GIs to liberate a continent. That's what gave women the courage to reach for the ballot. That's what gave marchers the courage to cross a bridge in Selma. That's what led workers to organize for collective bargaining and better wages. That's what makes America exceptional. That's what's always made America great.\nAnd America has never been about what somebody from on high will do for you. It's not about electing a dictator or an emperor or a king. It's about what we can do together, what's achieved by us together. It's about self-government. And Hillary understands that.\nShe knows this is a big country, a diverse country. And it doesn't work if we demonize each other all the time. She knows issues aren't always black and white and that progress requires compromise even when you're right. She knows that none of us are perfect, not even Presidents, but we should try to conduct ourselves with a sense of decency and propriety and bigheartedness, because our kids are paying attention.\nSo I have confidence that Hillary will continue the progress we've made. She will need allies like Patrick Murphy. It's not enough to elect Hillary and stick her with a Republican Congress that's—behaves the way they've been behaving. I mean, they decided not to work with me even when we were about to plunge into a depression, even when we were trying to save the auto industry, save people's jobs. They just said no because they thought, that way, it might help us in the midterm election.\nThey kept on doing it. Didn't matter if what we did turned out to be right. You haven't heard a Republican say: \"Man, Mr. President, thank you for saving the auto industry. We were—you were right. [Laughter] You haven't heard them say, \"You know, we should work together to build on what you did with Obamacare, but we're glad 20 million people got health care.\" You don't hear them say that. Why is that?\nThey—look, the problem is—and some of them are decent people, but they feel as if they have to do this in order to get power and that's all they're thinking about. So they are willing to engage in any kind of obstruction and gridlock, almost bringing down the world financial system if it helps them get elected; wrecking the economy when they can't get their way. That's not patriotism. That is not service.\nAnd now that it looks like maybe their nominee might lose—as long as you vote—they are already promising even more unprecedented dysfunction in Washington. Some of them have already said, we're going to engage in years of investigations, years of hearings, shutdowns, obstruction, more repeal votes.\nSome are saying, we won't appoint a ninth Supreme Court Justice. Remember, I nominated what many consider to be the most qualified guy to ever sit on the Supreme Court. He has now waited longer than any other nominee of either party to just get a hearing. Hasn't even gotten a hearing, has not gotten a vote. When you ask them, why would you do that? Why would you break hundreds of years of precedent? Why would you suddenly change the rules midstream?\nThey say: \"Well, we think the next President should make it; it's an election year. We think the next President should make—the people should have a say.\"\nOkay. So now though you are saying that if Hillary wins, it doesn't matter what the people say, we may not give him a vote anyway. That ain't right. Not only is it not right, but it also ain't right. [Laughter] It's also ain't right. I just want some consistency. If you say that we should be tougher on the Russians, then how do you nominate a guy who admires Putin?\nLook, gridlock does not come because Democrats and Republicans are equally obstructionists. I mean, Democrats have their flaws, I promise you. I know them. [Laughter] Just like I've got my flaws. I understand, we've all got blind spots. But generally speaking, Democrats have consistently tried to work with the other side and do reasonable things and just make the Government work.\nAnd gridlock is not some fog that comes down and just mysteriously happens. It happens because Republican politicians like Marco Rubio decide they will oppose anything that is good for the country if a Democrat proposes it. In fact, sometimes, I propose things that are in their platform—[laughter]—just to see what they'll do. [Laughter] And they'll say no. And I'll say, \"But you just proposed this.\"\n\"Don't matter. We can't do it now because you proposed it.\" [Laughter] \"In fact, it's your fault we can't support it because you supported it, even though we said we wanted to do it.\" [Laughter] Come on, man. Come on. Come on, man. Come on.\nSo if you think voting for gridlock makes sense, then you should vote for Republicans. But I think we can do better. I think we can create more jobs. I think we can raise wages even further. I think we can help families who right now have trouble affording childcare. I think we can raise the minimum wage. I think we can make sure there's equal pay for equal work. And if you believe in that, then you've got to vote Democrat up and down the ticket. You've got to vote for Hillary Clinton, you've got to vote for Patrick Murphy, people who will move the country forward.\nI know—last point, young people, I want to listen—I want you to listen here, because you were 10 when I first ran. [Laughter] So I just want to go back. I want to do a little bit of a reminder.\nI know that a lot of you may feel cynical. There's a lot in this election that can make you feel discouraged. But I've traveled this great Nation of ours, and I have met people from every walk of life, every region. The American people are good people. They're a decent people. They're a hard-working and resilient people. They're an innovative people. And we just have to make sure our politics reflects that.\nAnd right now, young people, you have this opportunity that doesn't come around all the time where history can move. You can bend the arc of history in a better direction. You can reject divisiveness. You can reject mean-spiritedness. We don't have to go backwards. We can go forward. You can elect a leader who has spent her entire life moving the country forward. You can elect our first female President to send a message to our daughters and our sons.\nYou have this precious chance to shape history. Don't let it slip away. I know because I've met so many young people, you are full of idealism. You want to make changes, but sometimes, you think that there's a way to do it and not be involved in politics. But I'm telling you right now, it is great if you've marched for criminal justice reform, but you've got to vote for a President and a Congress and State's attorneys and prosecutors who actually care about disrupting the pipeline from underfunded schools to overcrowded jails.\nI know a lot of young people care about the environment, but you've got to vote for a President and a Congress who actually believe that climate change is real and will build on the progress we've made to leave our children a better world. If you've been marching for immigration reform, I hear you. But you've got to vote for a President and a Congress who doesn't just see immigrants as criminals or rapists, but see them as people who love this country and are trying to do right by their families.\nIf you care about making sure that 20 million people keep their health care, then your vote matters. If you care that a marine today can serve his country and not hide the husband he loves, then you've got to be able to show that at ballot booth. If you care that that young person is able to afford college and become a doctor or a lawyer even though he comes from a family where nobody went to college before, you've got to make your voice heard.\nSo I'm asking of you today what I asked of you 8 years ago. Remember, my slogan was not \"Yes, I can.\"\nAudience members. Yes, we can!\nThe President. My slogan was \"Yes, we can.\" I'm not asking you to believe just in my ability to bring about change. I'm not asking you just to believe in Hillary's ability to bring about change. I'm asking you to believe in your ability to bring about change.\nI'm not on the ballot. I'm not on this ballot. But everything we've done these last 8 years is on the ballot. Twenty million people having health insurance is on the ballot. Increased Pell grants are on the ballot. Fairness is on the ballot. Decency is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot. Democracy is on the ballot. And Hillary Clinton will advance these things, and Patrick Murphy will advance these things, if you give them a chance.\nSo you've got to do everything you can this week. I know if you're here, you probably voted. That means you've got to get your friends to vote. You've got to get your family to vote. You've got to talk to Cousin Pookie. [Laughter] You've got to talk to Uncle Jimmy who's sitting on the couch, you know, and he's watching the World Series reruns. And that's cool. Nothing wrong with that. But you tell him, take 15, 20 minutes out, let's go vote.\nYou've got to reach out to your coworkers. You've got to talk to your neighbors, and you have to tell them this is the moment where America decides what it believes in. Do we believe in fear?\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. Or do we believe in hope?\nAudience members. Hope!\nThe President. Do we believe in cynicism?\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. Or do we believe in hope?\nAudience members. Hope!\nThe President. We have a chance to choose hope.\nAudience members. Hope!\nThe President. Choose hope.\nAudience members. Hope!\nThe President. Choose hope. Audience members. Hope!\nThe President. Choose hope.\nAudience members. Hope!\nThe President. Choose hope.\nAudience members. Hope!\nThe President. Choose hope.\nAudience members. Hope!\nThe President. But you've got to vote! And if you do, we will elect Hillary Clinton. We'll elect Patrick Murphy. We'll continue on this amazing journey. We'll finish what we started. We'll show the world why America is the greatest nation on Earth.\nI love you, Florida. Let's go!", "timestamp": "2016-11-03", "title": "Remarks at a Campaign Rally for Democratic Presidential Nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton in Jacksonville, Florida"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "This Executive order was published in the  Federal Register  on November 8.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119628", "text": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:\nSection 1. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to partner, consult, and coordinate with African governments, bilateral and multilateral partners, the private sector, and civil society to expand access to electricity and increase electricity generation in Sub-Saharan Africa, in both urban and rural areas. Through the Power Africa initiative (Power Africa), we aim to double access to power in Sub-Saharan Africa by adding 30,000 megawatts (MW) of capacity and 60 million new household and business connections by 2030, and in so doing, leapfrog to cleaner forms of energy and foster inclusive economic growth and opportunity across Sub-Saharan Africa.\nOn June 30, 2013, my Administration launched Power Africa, a new initiative to double access to power in Sub-Saharan Africa, where more than two-thirds of the population is without electricity, and more than 85 percent of those living in rural areas lack access to electricity. In its initial phase, Power Africa aimed to add more than 10,000 MW of cleaner, more efficient electricity generation capacity and to increase electricity access by at least 20 million new households and commercial entities with on-grid, mini-grid, and off-grid solutions. Power Africa builds on Africa's enormous power potential, including extensive clean geothermal, hydro, wind and solar energy resources, as well as vast oil and gas reserves. Power Africa works with countries to develop resources responsibly, build out power generation, transmission, and distribution, and expand the reach of mini-grid and off-grid solutions. Power Africa brings to bear a wide range of tools from across the Federal Government and more than 130 public and private sector partners to support investment in Africa's energy sector. Power Africa provides coordinated support to help African partners expand their power networks and access to electricity, including through policy and regulatory best practices, institutional capacity building, pre-feasibility support, grants, long-term financing, insurance, guarantees, credit enhancements, and technical assistance.\nOn August 5, 2014, during the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, my Administration affirmed that Power Africa is intended to reach across Sub-Saharan Africa, and tripled Power Africa's goals. Power Africa is now working toward adding 30,000 MW of new, cleaner electricity generation capacity and increasing electricity access by at least 60 million new connections. On January 28, 2016, my Administration, in coordination with Power Africa partners, launched the Power Africa Roadmap, which lays out a concrete plan for Power Africa to meet its ambitious goals by 2030.\nThe Electrify Africa Act of 2015, enacted on February 8, 2016 (Public Law 114-121) (the \"Act\"), calls for the development of a strategy to add at least 20,000 MW of electrical power and promote first-time access to power and power services for at least 50 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa by 2020 in both urban and rural areas—an effort that directly supports and complements Power Africa's goals. This order furthers the purposes of the Act and the work that Power Africa has been undertaking. Sec. 2. Establishment of the Coordinator for Power Africa. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) shall serve as the lead agency to facilitate the implementation of Power Africa and associated activities across the United States Government. The Administrator of USAID shall establish the position of Coordinator for Power Africa within USAID.\nSec. 3. Power Africa Working Group. (a) There is hereby established the Power Africa Working Group (Working Group), co-chaired by the Coordinator for Power Africa within USAID and a member of the National Security Council (NSC) staff to be designated by the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. The Working Group shall serve as the multi-agency coordinating and advisory body for the Federal Government's efforts to identify, evaluate, prioritize, and deliver assistance to energy projects across Sub-Saharan Africa in order to advance the energy access and electricity generation goals of Power Africa and promote policy cohesion across the Federal Government. Through the Working Group, participating departments and agencies shall provide advice and promote coherence of United States Government positions on and assistance for priority energy projects and policy reforms in support of Power Africa.\n(b) The Working Group shall consist of representatives of the following executive branch departments and agencies (Participating Agencies):\n(i) the Department of State;\n(ii) the Department of the Treasury;\n(iii) the Department of Agriculture;\n(iv) the Department of Commerce;\n(v) the Department of Energy;\n(vi) the Export-Import Bank of the United States;\n(vii) the United States Agency for International Development;\n(viii) the Overseas Private Investment Corporation;\n(ix) the United States Trade and Development Agency;\n(x) the Millennium Challenge Corporation;\n(xi) the United States Army Corps of Engineers;\n(xii) the Office of Management and Budget; and\n(xiii) such other agencies as the Co-Chairs may designate or invite to participate, including the United States African Development Foundation.\n(c) The Working Group may consult with non-United States Government entities that participate in Power Africa as bilateral, multilateral, private sector partners and nongovernmental organizations to provide input and advice to the United States Government, as appropriate, regarding the implementation of Power Africa.\n(d) The Working Group may establish sub-groups consisting exclusively of Working Group members or their designees, as appropriate, such as one for each of the three pillars of the Power Africa Roadmap: (1) megawatts, (2) connections, and (3) unlocking energy sector potential. (e) The Working Group shall be supported by the Office of the Coordinator for Power Africa within USAID.\nSec. 4. Mission and Functions of the Working Group. The Working Group, as may be necessary and appropriate to carry out this order, shall:\n(a) Ensure efficient and effective coordination of energy access activities in Sub-Saharan Africa among Participating Agencies.\n(b) Identify, prioritize, and evaluate potential Power Africa projects, regulatory and policy reforms, and programmatic focus areas, including maximizing deployment of and access to renewable energy.\n(c) Identify country and project specific obstacles to the development of the electricity sector, including financial and technical assistance needs and capacity building needs, and identify opportunities for Participating Agencies to deploy their respective tools and best practices to advance needed reforms and accelerate the completion of Power Africa projects.\n(d) Enhance coordination among Participating Agencies to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of United States Government development assistance and other development finance tools as related to Power Africa priorities.\n(e) Facilitate information sharing and coordination of partnerships between Participating Agencies and African governments, the private sector, development partners, and bilateral and multilateral partners to help advance Power Africa's goals.\n(f) Identify appropriate courses of action to liaise with host governments to advance regulatory and policy reforms, as well as energy transactions, related to Power Africa.\n(g) Identify best practices for Participating Agencies to coordinate their engagement with development partners, including bilateral donors, development finance institutions, and multilateral development banks on energy access issues, to ensure that Power Africa's tools are deployed in a way that is complementary to and leverages the impact of United States Government resources.\n(h) Meet with private sector partners, as appropriate, to review Power Africa projects and activities, and to solicit input regarding technical, policy, financial or political, obstacles that partners are encountering in the energy sector across Sub-Saharan Africa.\n(i) Meet with bilateral and multilateral development partners, as appropriate, to coordinate country-specific and regional energy access policy agendas, coordinate deployment of financial resources and technical expertise to identify and accelerate Power Africa projects and activities, and review project pipelines.\n(j) Monitor and periodically evaluate Power Africa projects and activities to measure the effectiveness of United States Government assistance and other development finance tools in achieving Power Africa's electricity generation and access goals, and to share lessons learned. These evaluations may recommend reforms to facilitate support for future projects and activities, and to increase the Working Group's effectiveness.\nSec. 5. Partnering with African Private Sector Companies. I hereby direct Participating Agencies to facilitate as appropriate, to the maximum extent possible under the law, the participation of local and regional companies in power, renewable energy, and climate change projects in low-income countries in Africa, including through the use of financing and risk insurance, where appropriate.\nSec. 6. Reporting. The Administrator of USAID, in coordination with the Participating Agencies, shall lead in the development of a report, to be transmitted to the Congress pursuant to section 7 of the Act and the Presidential Memorandum of August 3, 2016, \"Delegation of Authority Pursuant to Section 4 and Section 7 of the Electrify Africa Act of 2015,\" on progress made toward achieving the comprehensive, integrated, multiyear strategy that was transmitted to the Congress on August 6, 2016, pursuant to section 4 of the Act, to encourage the efforts of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa to implement national power strategies and develop an appropriate mix of power solutions to provide access to sufficient, reliable, affordable, and sustainable power in order to reduce poverty and drive economic growth and job creation.\nSec. 7. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof, or the status of that department or agency within the Federal Government; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nBARACK OBAMA\nThe White House,\nNovember 3, 2016.", "timestamp": "2016-11-03", "title": "Executive Order 13746—Advancing the Goals of the Power Africa Initiative to Expand Access to Electricity in Sub-Saharan Africa Through the Establishment of the President's Power Africa Working Group"}

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119578", "text": "Aboard Air Force One\nEn Route Fayetteville, North Carolina\n1:50 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: All right. Happy Friday, everybody. TGIF. Welcome aboard Air Force One as we make our way to North Carolina, where the President will once again urge voters in that battleground state to support the candidate who's committed to building on the progress our country has made under President Obama's leadership.\nToday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics issued the final jobs report before the election, and it serves as a useful illustration of the progress that we've made as a country. About two weeks after President Obama's inauguration in 2009, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released a jobs report on February 6th, which, when compared to today's latest report, demonstrates that the U.S. economy is far better off than it was when President Obama entered office.\nThat jobs report from February 6th of 2009 indicated that in the previous month, the U.S. economy had shed 598,000 jobs. Later revisions indicated in January of 2009 that the total job loss number was actually 791,000 jobs. That stands in quite stark contrast to the 161,000 jobs that our economy added this past month.\nIn that jobs report in early February of 2009, the unemployment rate was 7.8 percent. It was increasing and peaked a little over a year later at 10 percent. The latest jobs report indicated that the unemployment rate ticked down once again to 4.9 percent, which, of course, is less than half of what it was at its peak.\nIn February of 2009, the Bureau of Labor Statistics calculated that the unemployment rate in the African American community was 12.7 percent. It was on its way up to a high of 16.8 percent a little over a year later. The current report indicates that the unemployment rate in African American communities is actually 8.6 percent, almost half of what it was at its peak.\nThat February 2009 report indicated that the unemployment rate in the Hispanic community was 10.1 percent, on its way up to a high of 13 percent. The latest jobs report indicates that the unemployment rate in the Hispanic community is less than half that -- now at 5.7 percent.\nThe last data point that I want to raise is just the increase in wages. The latest report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates that wages increased four-tenths 1 percent last month. That's a significant increase. And over the last 12 months we've seen a 2.8 percent increase in wages.\nReal wages over the course of this business cycle have grown at a faster rate than any other business cycle since the early 1970s. And that's an indication that on the closely watched metric of wages, increases are, well, accelerating. And that's a good thing for the U.S. economy.\nOverall, these numbers underscore as clearly as any other piece of data the extreme risks of electing a President that would tear down the policies and roll back the priorities that has made this progress possible.\nSo with that long windup, let's go to your questions.\nQ: Josh, can we start with the American servicemembers that were killed in Jordan? Do we know why those troops opened fire on the American servicemembers? And is the U.S. seeking some type of apology or clarification from Jordan's government?\nMR. EARNEST: Josh, as you've seen from my colleagues at the Pentagon, three members of the United States armed forces were killed at a military base in Jordan earlier today. As the Commander-in-Chief, the President sends his condolences to the families of those who were killed. It underscores once again -- not just in the mind of the President, but in the mind of everybody who works at the White House -- the grave risks that our men and women in uniform assume to their own personal safety for the United States of America. We owe them a deep debt of gratitude.\nObviously, Josh, the United States is quite interested in getting to the bottom of what exactly occurred, and our expectation is that the government and military officials in Jordan will assist us in that investigation.\nThose armed forces -- those servicemembers were in Jordan as part of an ongoing training mission. It does underscore the important relationship between the United States and Jordan and how effectively our two countries are able to coordinate when it comes to mitigating the security risks facing both our countries. The United States is committed to that relationship because we believe it enhances the national security of the United States. We'll certainly want to draw on the kind of cooperation that the U.S. has with Jordan to get to the bottom of what exactly happened.\nQ: There have been reports of a threat from al Qaeda just ahead of the election. How seriously is the White House taking those threats? And sort of what are you doing to prepare for that kind of thing?\nMR. EARNEST: Roberta, I've seen those reports. I can't comment specifically on them. I don't have a new intelligence assessment to offer from here. What I can tell you is that the President and his national security team are vigilant about all threats that are facing the United States. The President is regularly updated on -- and by regularly, I mean updated every day -- on the risks that are facing the United States -- not just our broader national security, but also the risks that are facing the homeland. And the President's national security team adopts a posture of ensuring that we're adapting to the latest threat picture.\nWe're particularly mindful of the kinds of risks facing the United States around significant events. Sometimes it's holidays, like the holidays at the end of the year, or the Fourth of July. Sometimes that's around specific events of national significance. So we're certainly mindful of the potential of increased risks around a national event like Election Day. And even as we're mindful of those risks, the President's national security team and certainly our Homeland Security Department is taking the necessary steps to protect the American people and mitigate any changes to the threat picture.\nQ: Josh, two aides for Chris Christie were convicted in the Bridgegate scandal. I'm wondering, does the White House have a reaction to that case? And has that had an impact on the transition planning that's going on with Chris Christie being the chair of the transition for the Trump campaign?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have a specific reaction to the outcome. There obviously was an independent investigation conducted into those actions and some of the decisions that were made by those officials in the Christie administration. Given the fact that there's potential for an appeal here, I'm not going to weigh in in a lot of detail.\nMore generally, there has been no impact on the robust transition planning effort that's been underway. We have indicated a priority that President Obama has placed on ensuring a smooth transition to the next President regardless of who that person is. And our transition team has been able to work effectively with those individuals appointed by Mr. Trump to ensure that his team is able to effectively plan in the same way that Secretary Clinton's team has. And we expect that that planning will continue up to and through Election Day.\nQ: Josh, there are multiple reports today about sort of dissension in the ranks at the FBI. A group of field officers in New York who are openly anti-Hillary Clinton and pro-Trump, and part of the leaks that we're seeing are from FBI officers who are against Hillary Clinton. Is the President concerned that the FBI is becoming a partisan organization?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, this is obviously a question that's been in the news quite a bit over the last week. And I think what I can say is, as I've been saying over the course of most of the week, there's not a particular leak that I will comment on.\nBut what I will do is give voice to the kinds of traditions and guidelines and norms that have long guided the behavior and decisions made by officials at the Department of Justice and the FBI. Our democracy places a premium on separating out criminal investigations, law enforcement, from politics. That makes our democracy stronger. It inspires greater confidence in our criminal justice system by the public. And it has served our democracy well when investigators and law enforcement officials have observed those norms. And the President had an opportunity to speak about that this week as well.\nWhat's also true is that the Department of Justice and the FBI are instrumental in protecting the United States of America. We know that there are FBI and Department of Justice investigations that have disrupted plots to carry out acts of violence here in the United States. We know that the Department of Justice and the FBI work effectively together to fight crime. And we know that the Department of Justice and the FBI work effectively together to protect the liberties and civil rights of the American people. The President believes that work is critically important. He certainly doesn't want to see anything that would undermine that important mission. And the President has confidence that the vast majority of the men and women in the Department of Justice and the FBI, including at the highest levels, are acting consistent with their responsibilities and doing the right thing to keep the country safe, to fight crime, and to protect our freedom.\nQ: You said he spoke to someone from the FBI?\nMR. EARNEST: I said the President spoke to these norms and values in an interview earlier this week.\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. EARNEST: It's okay. Thank you for clarifying.\nQ: So is he concerned about partisanship in the ranks or at the top of the FBI?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I just can't speak to these individual reports. But I'll just say that, in general, the President believes that the longstanding guidelines and traditions and norms that prevent politics from intruding on law enforcement decisions are important to observe. And our country has been well-served by the longstanding commitment to those values and norms. And, frankly, it enhances the ability of law enforcement officials and lawyers at the Department of Justice to maintain the confidence of the American people, even as they carry out the important work to enforce the law, protect the homeland, and protect the freedoms and liberties of the American people.\nQ: But Josh, there seems to be some disagreement about whether the President's comments in that interview you mentioned should be construed as criticism of Comey, given that he laid out some norms and traditions that he believes in that are in direct contrast to what has exactly happened from Comey. So is the President comfortable with the fact that his comments are being broadly perceived as a criticism of FBI Director Comey?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I think the President tried to be as clear as he can in talking about a complex situation. The President noted in that interview that he was not going to talk about any of the particulars of the current situation. But the President did go into some detail in talking about why these norms and guidelines that limit public discussion of criminal investigations are so important. And the President believes that those norms and guidelines are really important and are worth upholding.\nQ: Why won't you speak to the reports that Kristen asked you about? Everyone is seeing them. They're shaping people's perceptions of the FBI and the Justice Department. So why wouldn't you say anything about that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess for a couple of reasons. The first is that I certainly can't speak in a lot of -- based on my own personal knowledge of the situation there, there's been no investigation that's been conducted by the White House into the activities of FBI agents in any field office, let alone in New York. So I don't have any sort of independent knowledge of what exactly has happened there or what kinds of things are prompting these reports. I'm not calling these reports into question, I'm just suggesting that I don't have my own independent knowledge or independent basis for commenting on them.\nThe second is, I'm also wary of the kind of institutional responsibilities that apply to the White House as well; that in the same way that it's important for law enforcement officials to protect their own -- to prevent their own political views from interfering with their ability to do their job, officials who work at the White House also have a responsibility of avoiding even the appearance of interfering with the ability of law enforcement officials to do their job. And so I'm sensitive to the fact about how any comments on this specific matter could be construed because these are comments from the person who speaks frequently for the President of the United States.\nWhat I do feel confident in talking to you about are the President's deep feelings about the priority that we should all place, and that all law enforcement officials should place, on these kinds of longstanding guidelines that limit the public discussion of criminal investigations.\nQ: So you said you don't have any knowledge. Do you think this is -- does the President think this is something that should be looked into?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, there certainly are mechanisms in place for however a review like that to happen. There's a reason that there is an inspector general. There's a reason that the Congress has oversight responsibilities over the entire executive branch. But ultimately, those two entities that I've cited don't answer to the President of the United States.\nQ: Just on the election, what does the President think about the lagging turnout in early voting among African American voters?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President is watching the situation carefully, and I think the President has delivered a quite -- a series of impassioned speeches encouraging people to participate in our democracy and to try to mobilize support for the candidate that is vowing to build on the progress that our country has made under President Obama's leadership. And the President is warning against complacency, and he certainly wants people to understand the stakes in this election. And he's confident that if people do understand the stakes in this election and take seriously the responsibility that they have as citizens to shape the future of the country, that people will be mobilized and will participate.\nBut look, the reports differ in states all across the country. I think the President's view would be the country would be better off if more people in every state are participating and casting a vote regardless of who they're voting for.\nQ: You talked about the extreme risks that would be posed by a Trump presidency to the job numbers. Donald Trump was endorsed by the KKK newspaper this week. It happened just this morning at a rally, people screaming, \"Execute her!\" -- talking about Hillary Clinton. Yet we're going into the final weekend with this race looking very, very close.\nWhat does the President think this says about the country that if Trump wins, or even if he doesn't win, that there is close to a majority of the country who is supporting this kind of candidacy?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think, first of all, we'll know on Tuesday exactly what percentage of the country offered up that kind of support. There's no hiding the fact that the President has been deeply disturbed by some of the rhetoric that we've seen put forward by the Republican nominee and his team. And that has not just been true in the last couple of weeks. That's been true over the last several months, even the better part of a year.\nAnd the President has been concerned that some of that rhetoric has been entirely inconsistent with the founding principles of this country. He has found much of that rhetoric to be destructive and damaging. The President is not alone. There are people in both parties across the country who have been deeply concerned about the rhetoric, and language, and tactics that have been employed by the Republican nominee. And it only serves to motivate the President even more to be supportive of a candidate that is campaigning consistent with the kinds of values that have animated his time in public life.\nQ: But it's not just the rhetoric from Trump, it's the way it's resonating. A lot of people are responding to it, or are not speaking out against it. What does the President think that means about the country, not just about Donald Trump?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, what we have seen is a Republican candidate that has been successful in -- as the President himself has said -- playing on the anxieties, economic and otherwise, of a large swath of the American electorate. And the President, in his stump speech, sort of -- well, mocks this a little bit, right. Sort of raises this question about why would you expect a billionaire who has made a bunch of his money by stiffing working people -- why would you expect that person to be a champion for working people once he enters the Oval Office. That's sort of a good example of the President sort of raising doubts about whether or not the Republican nominee actually will make good on the promise to address the concerns that have been raised.\nSo some of this goes to the kinds of tactics that are being used by the other side that are breathtakingly cynical. Some of this goes to the mood of a country that's anxious about some of the changes that we've seen in our country. And the President has tried to make the case -- and Secretary Clinton has too -- that our country is going to be more effective in confronting the challenges that we face if we stand together and we draw on the kinds of values that were instrumental to the founding of the country. The Republican nominee is offering a different approach that suggests that we should divide ourselves up and consider some tactics that, frankly, violate some of those norms and principles that we hold dear in this country, at least that we have for a long time.\nQ: Is President not disturbed that it's working with a lot of people?\nMR. EARNEST: I think we'll find out on Tuesday whether or not it worked.\nQ: If the polls are to be believed, minimum 40 percent of the country -- probably more than that -- will be voting for Donald Trump. That's not disturbing to the President?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I think it will -- we'll have an opportunity to take a look at the metrics and sort of consider how much support the Republican nominee gets, and probably be able to dig in a little bit into why that is. I think to the extent that we're willing to do any pre-election analysis, I think some of this does raise some significant questions about the vacuum that exists at the center of the Republican Party platform.\nThere has not been any commitment on the part of Republican leaders in Washington, D.C. to any sort of conservative agenda, even though they have a governing majority in the United States Congress. And that has allowed -- that vacuum being created has allowed a candidate that isn't particularly conservative to fill the void. And that has been bad for the country, both in the context of an election, but it's also been bad for the country in the context of a dysfunctional Congress that hasn't been able to do much over the last couple of years.\nQ: Has the President spoken with President Park of South Korea? I mean, they seem to be pretty close in the past. Is he hoping that she's able to hang onto her position? Or is he kind of trying to keep his distance right now?\nMR. EARNEST: What I would say, Josh, is that the alliance between the United States and South Korea is a close alliance, it's a strong alliance, and it's one that is strong today as it's been. And one of the hallmarks of a strong alliance is that it remains durable, even when different people and different personalities are leading the countries. And it's because the government and people of both countries are committed to that alliance.\nSo President Obama had an effective working relationship with President Park's predecessor in terms of strengthening our alliance, and the President has been able to work effectively with President Park to strengthen the alliance between our two countries in the three or four years that she's been in office as well.\nObviously, she's facing a difficult domestic political situation, and that's something that I won't weigh in on. I'm not aware that the President has weighed in on it, either in public or in private. And the President has not -- I don't believe the President has spoken to her since shortly after we returned from Asia, and that was in the aftermath of a nuclear test from North Korea.\nBut all of the other elements of our alliance remain in place. And the U.S. commitment to that alliance is as strong as ever.\nQ: On another ally, Turkey -- the Turkish government has arrested Kurdish opposition leaders. Germany has responded strongly. Does the White House have any response? And is it something that the President hopes to speak about with sort of his allied leaders when he sees them in about a year from now -- a week or so from now?\nMR. EARNEST: There's a lot that's been going on in Turkey over the last week or so, so I appreciate you asking me that question. The United States is deeply concerned by the Turkish government's detentions of opposition party -- of opposition members of parliament, including the co-chairs of the HDP -- the Peoples' Democratic Party. This comes on the heels of what appears to be an increase in official pressure on opposition media outlets in Turkey, including to the detention earlier this week of Murat Sabuncu, the editor-in-chief of one of Turkey's most respected newspapers.\nOur deep concerns have been expressed by -- have already been expressed by senior U.S. officials to their Turkish counterparts. And we underscored in both private conversations and in public that our Turkish Ally has a special obligation as a democracy to reinforce the public's confidence in the rule of law.\nNow, what's also true is that Turkey is a country that has sustained significant violence, including at the hands of terrorists. And the United States condemns the deadly and indefensible bombing in Diyarbakir. We wish the wounded a speedy recovery and offer our condolences to the loved ones of those who lost their lives. We again call on the PKK to cease its senseless brutal attacks, and to continue to stand with Turkey in its fight.\nThe United States supports the government of Turkey's efforts to bring to justice those responsible for the July 15th coup attempt. We stand by our friend and NATO Ally, Turkey, in the fight against terror in all its forms, including against the PKK. However, as Turkey's Ally and friend, we encourage the government of Turkey to ensure that the rule of law and fundamental freedoms are protected. Democracies become stronger by allowing diverse expressions of views, particularly in difficult times.\nSuppressing speech and opinion does not support the fight against terrorism. It only encroaches on the fundamental freedoms that help ensure that democracies remain strong.\nQ: Can you say what U.S. officials spoke to their counterparts in the wake of these arrests?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any calls to read out from here, but you might check with my colleagues at the State Department.\nQ: Do you have any reaction -- the President is getting some criticism for saying that only a handful of people are being affected by Obamacare, yesterday in his speech. People are saying that downplays the actual effect on people who are being hit by these premium hikes.\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think the point of the President's remarks is that the vast majority of people who go to HealthCare.gov and sign up for health care will be able to purchase plans for $75 a month or less. With regard to those Americans who don't benefit from subsidies -- and the fact is, most Americans who can go to HealthcCare.gov and do sign up will qualify for subsidies -- but for those who don't, the President has put forward specific proposals that would address the concerns and reduce their costs. And that's everything from expanding tax credits to getting all states across the country to expand Medicaid. We know that would put downward pressure on prices, too.\nSo the President has put forward some specific ideas for addressing those concerns, and the President believes that Democrats and Republicans in Congress should work together to enact them.\nQ: Week ahead?\nMR. EARNEST: I'll do it quickly. It's around here somewhere. Okay, I'm going to do it from memory. Oh, you're saved.\nOn Sunday, the President will participate in a Hillary for America event in Orlando, Florida.\nOn Monday, the President will participate in a Hillary for America event in Durham, New Hampshire. Afterwards, the President and the First Lady will travel to Philadelphia to participate in a Hillary for America event. There may be some additional changes to the schedule on Monday, so we'll just keep you posted on all events.\nOn Tuesday and Wednesday, the President will be at the White House and he'll be attending meetings at the White House.\nOn Thursday, the President will welcome the Cleveland Cavaliers to the White House to honor their 2016 NBA championship.\nAnd then on Friday, Veterans Day, the President will attend a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and deliver remarks at the Veterans Day ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery.\nQ: Should we expect to see the President with the President-elect this coming week?\nMR. EARNEST: Obviously, the President's schedule on Wednesday and Thursday is something that we're keeping flexible to allow us to add an event like that if it works for both people. So stay tuned on that.\nQ: Wednesday is currently meetings at the White House?\nMR. EARNEST: Wednesday and Thursday right now.\nQ: Although, the Cavaliers are Thursday?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, so you're right -- Tuesday and Wednesday are both meetings at the White House. The other obvious question is sort of about when the President would address the results of the election. I would not anticipate that he would do that Tuesday night.\nQ: Not even in a paper statement?\nMR. EARNEST: Potentially. But we'll keep you posted. But certainly not on camera or in person. But we'll obviously keep you -- but potentially Wednesday and Thursday. And we'll just keep you posted on that.\nEND 2:21 P.M.

But America can't do it alone, and the time for action is now. It's up to all countries to do their part and help their neighbors. That's why we launched the Global Health Security Agenda in 2014 – to empower the global community to step up, bolstered by American leadership, and secure a world that is safe from epidemic threats. Today, President Obama signed an Executive Order to further advance the Global Health Security Agenda.\nAlready, we've seen historic success: Working with partners in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and from around the world, we led the way in ending the Ebola epidemic in West Africa – and we are leading the way on the Zika response here at home. Fifty-five countries, as well as stakeholders from across nongovernmental and private sectors and next generation leaders in global health security have signed on to the Agenda. The effort has resulted in commitments from G-7, Nordic, and key G-20 partners to assist at least 76 countries and regions that will make a real difference in communities around the world. The Global Health Security Agenda has also led to the creation of a new way to identify gaps through external evaluation, which 22 countries – including the United States – have now undergone. As part of our own commitment to this Agenda, the United States is partnering with 31 countries and the Caribbean Community to provide assistance to create, for the first time, a step-by-step plan to get prepared.\nThe Executive Order signed today builds on this progress by establishing long-term policy objectives and memorializing a comprehensive framework for the United States to continue, strengthen, and institutionalize our achievements and use common targets to measure progress. The Executive Order will save lives by further leveraging the full power and leadership of the United States Government and is an important step toward a safer, more resilient future.", "timestamp": "2016-11-04", "title": "Press Release - Statement by National Security Advisor Susan E.

I'll tell you, I am so glad to be back in Michigan. And that introduction, I'm just still vibrating from it. I thank my longtime friend, Reverend Wendell Anthony, for giving us some of the best lines that we've had in the whole campaign. Thank you Wendell.\nYou know, there's something special about this place. And some of you may have recognized the song that was playing when I came in, an amazing anthem sung by the talented Andra Day called 'Rise Up.' And that is what Detroit is doing – you are rising up! And that is exactly what we're going to do in America. We are going to rise up and make sure the American dream is big enough for everyone.\nI'm looking forward to working with the great team you have here in Detroit and in Michigan. I want to thank your senators, Senator Debbie Stabenow and Senator Gary Peters. I want to thank your members of Congress, Congressman John Conyers, Sandy Levin, Congresswomen Brenda Lawrence and Debbie Dingell. I want to thank your great mayor, Mayor Mike Duggan, and thank you. Wayne County Executive Warren Evans. Sheriff Benny Napoleon. The president of the UAW, Dennis Williams. Longtime friends and former colleagues of mine, former Senator Carl Levin and his wife Barbara are here. And to all who are present today. And I was delighted that my friend and my supporter, Mark Cuban, could be here because – he's not only a real billionaire – he's actually shared his profits with his employees.\nNow, are you ready to vote on Tuesday? Are you ready to volunteer to get everybody out to vote? Are you ready to choose our next president and commander-in-chief? Did any of you see the three debates that we had? Well, I spent four and a half hours standing next to Donald Trump, proving once and for all I have the stamina to be the next president.\nNow, he kept saying a lot of unusual things, didn't he? And, you know, there's a certain preparation you do to be ready for those debates, and of course I did it because I think you should prepare to be president of the United States. And I did practice my composure. People said to me, well, how did you do that? The things he was saying. And then in that second debate when he was following you around and lurching over you. I said, well, I did practice. And I had my friends and my family just spend hours saying terrible things to me. So I was ready. But he would say, like, 'Well, what have you done for 30 years?' And you know, I don't want to brag. But I do think it matters what you've done, and especially what you've done that maybe improves somebody else's life, right?\nAnd one of the great joys of this campaign has been traveling around our country meeting people who have been affected by what we've been doing. For example, as First Lady, I helped create the Children's Health Insurance Program, which covers eight million kids. And these are families that they're not poor families, they're working people, but they don't make enough money and they don't work for somebody who provides insurance, and so very often their kids were being affected by not getting the health care they should have had. I met a woman whose baby daughter when she was born was diagnosed as totally deaf, and the doctor said, 'We're sorry, there's really nothing we can do for her.' But this mother, like many mothers I know, did not take that for an answer, right? She got on the internet. She began to research and she found that there were treatments that she could maybe provide to her little daughter, but they were expensive and she and her husband didn't have that kind of money and they didn't have insurance. She was at her doctor's office and just so distraught, and the doctor said, 'Well, there's this new thing called the Children's Health Insurance Program. Maybe you should look into it.' Turned out she was eligible. She signed up. She started giving her daughter the best health care that every child in this country should be able to have, by the way. And when I was in North Carolina, I heard about her and I got to meet her, but more than that, I met her daughter, who talked to me and who just graduated from college – because she got the health care and she got the treatment that she deserved to have.\nI'll tell you what, that is how I judge my last 30 years. Have I done something to help somebody else? I am well aware of the blessings that I have had, and I want to be sure that all of us figure out a way to pay it forward, make it possible for more families, more kids to have the chance to live up to their own God-given potential.\nAnd I was a Senator in New York on 9/11, so I know what can happen – the evil and the hatred of terrorism. I saw it. And I spent my time helping to rebuild New York City and helping to get health care for the brave first responders who ran toward danger, not away from it – our police, our firefighters, our EMTs. And I'll tell you who else we got covered. We got construction workers who ran with their supplies and their tools, and I see one right out there who knows exactly what I'm talking about. All across the city, people were leaving their job sites and rushing toward danger. That was America at its best. And don't ever forget what we are capable of being, who we are. We are not afraid. We are brave, courageous people who will do our best if given the chance.\nAs your Secretary of State, I went to 112 countries, negotiated ceasefires, reduced the threat of nuclear weapons, stood up for human rights and women's rights and worker rights and LGBT rights. I'm telling you this because I want you to know that I will do everything I can. If I am honored to be your president, I will get up every day in that White House, and I will go to work for you and your families to make it possible for you to get the chances and the opportunities you deserve to have.\nI want you to have a candidate you can vote for and not just someone to vote against. That's why Tim Kaine and I have run a campaign based on ideas and issues, not insults because if you really take a look at what is at stake in this election, it is a choice between two very different visions for America. I've got to say when I hear my opponent talk about America, I don't recognize the country he's talking about. It is so dark, so divisive, so hateful. That is not the America that I believe in. I believe that we should have a confident, optimistic, inclusive vision of where we're going and how we're going to get there. I love our country, and I believe in the American people. And I think there's nothing we can't achieve if we work together and we set some goals and we go after them. You see, we believe in an America that is bighearted, not small-minded. We believe in an America that is already great but can be greater if we do our part. And we believe America is great because America is good. Never forget that. If we lift each other up and not tear each other down, we can go even further. And I believe with all my heart. That's why the slogan of my campaign sums it up, that we are stronger together.\nAnd so come next January 20th, America is going to have a new president. I know – I know that – I know that a lot of people say that they want change. Well, let me tell you this. Change is inevitable. There will be change. The question is, what kind of change are we going to have?\nAre we going to build a stronger, fairer, better country or are we going to fear the future and each other? I sure hope not. That is not the America that I believe we are.\nAnd so here is what I want to ask you to do. I want you to talk to your friends and your family and your neighbors. Michigan is one of these states that doesn't have early voting. I've been all over the country going to states that are already voting. In fact, I don't know. About 31 to 32-3 million people have already voted in those states. But Michigan votes on Tuesday.\nAnd I imagine – I imagine there are – some of you know people who say they're going to vote for Donald Trump. Right? I know. I know. I understand that. I mean, I would hope you would try to stage an intervention before it's too late. But maybe you could ask them with you to imagine, imagine January 20th, 2017. And imagine that my opponent is taking the oath of office in front of the Capitol. Imagine having a president who demeans women and mocks the disabled, who insults African Americans and Latinos and Muslims, who personally engages in busting unions and preventing people from having the right to bargain collectively. Now, the truth is we really don't have to imagine what that would be like because everything he has said and done, both in his career and in this campaign, tells you what could happen.\nNow, Michelle Obama, who says so many wise and wonderful things, she said the presidency doesn't change who you are; it reveals who you are. And I think we've seen who Donald Trump is.\nMaya Angelou, another great American, Maya Angelou said, when someone shows you who he is, believe him the first time. And if my opponent were to win, we would have a president who has only ever been in it for himself.\nJust last year, he said again it wouldn't have mattered if we had rescued the auto industry or let it go bankrupt. What is he talking about? I'm proud that President Obama saved the auto industry. And I'm even prouder that because of the hard work of people in Detroit and across Michigan and the Midwest, the U.S. auto industry just had its best year ever.\nIf Donald wins the election, we'd have a president who wants to ban every Muslim in the world from coming to visit the United States. We are a country founded on religious freedom. That runs contrary to our Constitution. We would have a president who has said repeatedly that he thinks the lives of black people are all about crime and poverty and despair. He has no idea about the strength of the black church and the vibrancy of black-owned businesses and the excellence of historically black colleges and universities. He seems to know nothing about the rise of a new generation of black activists and the success of black leaders in every field. I think he needs a visit from Reverend Wendell Anthony, don't you?\nYesterday in North Carolina I was honored to stand with a woman named Mae Brown Wiggins. Decades ago, she was a hard-working nurse in New York City. She was looking for an apartment that she could afford to rent. But Donald Trump and his father, Fred, turned her away. You see, whenever African Americans tried to rent Trump apartments, their application was marked with a 'C,' C for colored. And that didn't sit very well with Mae, so she went to the authorities, and eventually the Department of Justice sued the to us for housing discrimination. And although they settled, they wouldn't change. So the government had to take them back to court. That's a pattern. This is what happens time and time again with my opponent. If he were to win, he would be in charge of the Federal Housing Department. If he doesn't respect all Americans now, how can we trust him to serve all Americans in the future?\nHe has such a casual disregard of our Constitution. He doesn't seem to understand the rule of law, that we really are a nation of laws, not men. Here's the latest example. There was a terrible crime back in 1990 in New York City. It was called the Central Park Five. Maybe some of you have heard of it. There were five black and Latino kids, some as young as 14. They were wrongfully convinced, and they were in prison where they spent years. Donald Trump took out full-page ads calling for the death penalty for the kids. And even after they were exonerated by DNA evidence and someone else confessed to that terrible crime, Trump actually said they should still be in prison. It doesn't matter if you're innocent. If he decides that you should be in prison or you should be locked up. No wonder he admired Vladimir Putin, because that's exactly what Putin does to his people.\nSo we can't trust him with our Constitution. We can't trust him to obey the rule of law. He has shown us who he is. Now we have to decide who we are. So let me paint you a different picture. Here is what we're going to do together if we win this election on Tuesday night.\nWe have three big challenges. Number one, we got to get the economy working for everyone, not just those at the top. Number two, we've got to keep our country safe, and we have to work with our allies to lead the world with strength and intelligence toward peace and prosperity. Number three, we've got to bring our country together. We have got to overcome these divides. We have to heal our nation. And I hope that you will help me meet all three of those challenges.\nI have said repeatedly that we're going to take on discrimination and bigotry because any time we hold somebody back, it can lead to holding other people back. We can't accept as normal what we're seeing across our country because of his campaign. A church in Mississippi was burned this week. Someone painted 'Vote Trump' on the side and then set it on fire. We can't let – we can't let that happen. What happened in Flint, Michigan should not be normal or acceptable. Our kids should be guaranteed clean air and clean water. Those are basics. We've got to do everything we can to make sure that we take care of our children.\nAnd it's important for us to recognize that when I talk about getting the economy to work for everybody, that means I want the biggest jobs program since World War II – infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, clean, renewable energy technology. Some people say we can't do that. Well, I'm telling you, they're wrong. They're wrong. We have the best workers, the most productive workers. We're going to give them more to work on, more products to produce. And we're going to do more for small business because small business is the backbone of so many communities. And I want everybody to have the chance to succeed in America. That means we're going to dismantle the so-called school-to-prison pipeline and replace it with the cradle-to-college pipeline.\nAnd we're going to make sure that every child has a chance to go to a good school with good teachers, no matter what zip code that child lives in. And I want to start with our youngest kids, with pre-kindergarten programs. And then I want to be a good partner with our teachers. We've got to have high expectation and get results in helping our children. And I want to be sure that we put technical education back into high school because there are good jobs out there waiting for young people with the skills to do them.\nIt'll be important that we create an environment in which our police and our communities can work together and trust each other. I believe we are safer when everyone has respect for the law and everyone is respected by the law. And that's what we're going to work for.\nWe're also going to take common-sense steps to reduce gun violence and save lives. This has nothing to do with the scare tactics coming from my opponent. Have you seen he's starting to wear a camo hat now? Really. We are going to work with responsible gun owners who understand that we've got to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them in the first place.\nAnd while we create more safe communities, we want to invest in those communities. I want to continue the good work that our past two Democratic Presidents have done, one named Clinton, one named Obama. And I want to be a really strong partner. I'll compete a little with them. I want to be a really strong partner with Detroit and other cities that are on the way back up to make sure you get the investment and the support, the housing, and the jobs that you need.\nBut we also have to make sure our economy is fairer. That's why I believe we should raise the national minimum wage, because people who work full time should not be left in poverty. And isn't it finally time to guarantee equal pay for women? This is not a women's issue. If you have a wife, a mother, a daughter, or a sister who works, it's your issue. It's a family issue. And every time I talk about wanting to have affordable childcare, paid family leave, equal pay for women, the other side accuses me of playing the women's card. I'll tell you what, if standing up for equal pay is playing the women's card, then deal me in.\nAnd one of the other big challenges we're going to take on – I am so excited about this. I am really proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran because it was a campaign about issues. And what we decided after it was over is how we could work together to make sure that everybody who wants to go to college can afford not just to start but actually to graduate. So we came up with a plan that if you go to a public college or university, you will go tuition-free if your family makes less than $125,000 a year. And it will be debt-free for everybody above that so you don't go into debt. And for people who already have student debt, we're going to help you pay it down and pay it off to get out from under it. And I want especially to support historically black colleges and universities that have done so much to bring forth a leadership cadre in our country.\nNow, this is just some of what we are offering in this campaign, because we really believe you need to look at what will happen after the election. I had a friend say to me the other day, 'People are just frustrated and angry.' I get that. I understand that. We had the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression in '08 and '09. Millions of people lost their jobs, millions lost their homes, family wealth was wiped out. That is a trauma and people are still suffering and still climbing back from that. I get it. But I learned a long time ago from my late mother, anger is not a plan. Right? Be angry, vent about it, and then roll up your sleeves and get to work. That's what I will do. That's why we've put this all down. It's on our website, hillaryclinton.com. It's in a book that Tim Kaine and I put out called 'Stronger Together.' Because not only do I want you to know what I will try to do as your president; I want you to hold me accountable. I want you, when I come back to Detroit, which I will do when I travel around Michigan, which I will do, I want you to say, 'Well, how's it going getting those new jobs started? How much progress are we making on making sure college is affordable?' I believe in making lists. Maybe it's a women's thing. My husband said – once said to me one time, 'You have lists of your lists.' Well, I do because I want to know what we're going to get done and how we can make progress together.\nAnd ultimately, this election really is about the kind of country we want for our kids, and in my case now, my grandkids. Are we really a nation that believes in freedom and justice for all?\"\nAudience: \"Yes.\"\nClinton: \"Are we really a nation that recognizes our best years can still be ahead of us if we make up our minds to have that be our goal? I believe we can do this together. My opponent at his convention said, 'I alone can fix it.' Well, no, nobody alone does anything. When our founders met in Philadelphia, it wasn't one person creating our country. It was many people working together and fighting a revolution to get that democracy and then to fight for civil rights and voting rights and workers' rights and women's rights and LGBT rights. None of them – none of them were won by one person alone. The American labor movement didn't happen because somebody one day said, 'I alone can make it happen.' It took millions of people in every one of these movements marching and speaking out and sitting in. Barack Obama wasn't put into the White House by one person alone. It took everybody working and organizing, and yes, voting. That is how progress happens in America.\nSo really, it all comes down to you, my friends. You have to vote. Our progress is on the line. Everything that has happened up until this point is on the line. I'm ready to defend and build on the progress that we've made. I'm proud I was a member of President Obama's cabinet. I'm proud that – he and I are friends. But he knows and I know that American leadership, American presidents, it's like running a relay. You do your very best, and then you pass off the baton and you just hope that the person you pass it off to doesn't drop to the ground or doesn't turn around and run back the way we came from, which is what my opponent is promising to do.\nNow, I've told the President that when he hands off the baton that he's going to have to bend over. He's a lot taller than I am. But I'm excited about what we can do. I know this has been a tough campaign. I've got people coming up to me saying they've got migraines they never had before. They have stomachaches that they don't know what they're going to do with. I get it. It has been in many ways a really tough campaign, but I'll tell you what. Michigan, you can make the difference.\nAll I'm asking you is talk to your friends, talk to your family, talk to your coworkers, talk to everybody. If you have time to volunteer, go to hillaryclinton.com to volunteer or text 'join,' J?o-i-n, to 47246. Because when your children – and there are some beautiful children in this crowd here today. When your children or grandchildren ask what you did in 2016 when everything was on the line, I want you to be able to say, 'I voted for a better, stronger, fairer America.' An America where we build bridges, not walls. And where we prove, once and for all, that love trumps hate. Let's get to work. Thank you. Thank you, Detroit. Thank you, Michigan. God bless you.", "timestamp": "2016-11-04", "title": "Remarks at Eastern Market in Detroit, Michigan"}

It's good to see you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you!\nSo, listen, listen, it is good to be back in North Carolina. And I'm sorry that we can't fit everybody in, but the fire marshals had to cut things off. But I just want to let everybody know, number one, I love you guys and I'm so grateful. I'm so grateful for all the support that you've shown me and Michelle and Sasha and Malia. We're so appreciative of the prayers you've given us these last 8 years. I could not have won North Carolina in '08 without you.\nAnd the fact of the matter is that we only won by about two votes per precinct here in North Carolina. So if anybody tells you your vote doesn't matter, they're lying to you. Your vote matters. And what I'm asking you to do—and I know you'll have a chance to hear what I've got to say in a second—but what I'm asking you to do is just make sure that everybody you know is going out to vote.\nYou can still early vote, you can still one-stop vote here in North Carolina. I need you not just to vote yourselves, I need you to go out and just nag the heck out of folks who are not voting. And I need you to tell them that Barack, personally, is asking them to vote so that we can make sure that all the progress we've made over these last 8 years is continued, because I can tell you that the alternative is not good.\nBut Hillary Clinton is not only one of the most qualified people ever to run for the Presidency, but she is going to continue the work that we have done over these last 8 years. And you, North Carolina, can decide this election by making sure everybody votes.\nSo do not get weary. Don't get complacent. Don't get discouraged. Just go out there and do the work. Just go out there and do the work. And you know I'm working pretty hard. You know, I'm not on the ballot, but justice is on the ballot, and equality is on the ballot. And jobs and childcare and help for young people with student loans, all that is on the ballot.\nSo get out there and get to work. And if you deliver North Carolina for me, that is the best sendoff you could ever give me and Michelle.\nLove you, guys.

Hello, Broncos! Oh, it is good to be back in North Carolina! I'm spending a lot of time in North Carolina. It's good to be at Fayetteville State University! Are you fired up?\nAudience members. Yes!\nThe President. Are you ready to go?\nAudience members. Yes!\nThe President. Can everybody please give Donovan a big round of applause for that great introduction? Few other people I want to thank, a couple friends of mine. Number one, your next attorney general, Josh Stein. Your next North Carolina Supreme Court associate justice, Judge Mike Morgan. Your next Lieutenant Governor, Linda Coleman. Your next Governor, Roy Cooper. Your next United States Senator, Deborah Ross.\nFour days, North Carolina. Four days.\nAudience member. We're ready!\nThe President. Are you ready?\nAudience members. Yes!\nThe President. We've got 4 days to decide the future of this country.\nNow I'm going to invite those of you with seats to go ahead and sit down, because I'm going to talk for a while. I've got some things to say. We've got some business to do. I want you to settle in here because I just want to—I want us to focus.\nWe've got 4 days to decide the future of this country. The good news is, you actually don't have to wait till election day to vote. You, here in North Carolina, can vote right now. If you are not registered, you have until tomorrow to register and vote at any one-stop location in your county. And there is one less than half a mile from here, at the Smith Recreation Center. It is very close by. Half a mile, that's like a 15-minute walk. That's across the street. It's—you just have to cross the street and you can vote.\nThere are volunteers here who will get you there. If you—see these folks, they will walk you over there if you don't know how to cross the street. [Laughter] You've got no excuse. And to find other one-stop locations near you, you can go to iwillvote.com. I need you to vote. America needs you to vote, because we have to finish what we started 8 years ago.\nNow, think about where we were when I visited Fayetteville in the final days of the 2008 campaign. First of all, some of you all don't remember because you were like 8. [Laughter] So I am now feeling a little old, because there are college students who were watching Nickelodeon and not really focused on the election. So I need to remind you what was going on.\nWe were living through two long wars. We were about to enter into the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Eight years later, because of the hard work of the American people, we've turned the page. Today, an America that was on the edge of depression has battled back.\nLast year, incomes rose faster than any time since 1968. Poverty fell faster than any time since 1968. Businesses have created 15 1/2 million new jobs. The unemployment rate is 4.9 percent, a 9-year low. Twenty million Americans have health care that didn't have it before.\nWe kicked our addiction to foreign oil, and by the way, gas prices are two bucks a gallon. Back in '08, the folks who were running against me said you elect Obama it's going to be $6. It's $2. You notice, by the way, they don't say, oh, we were wrong, thank you, Obama. [Laughter] They don't say that. But I thought—I just thought I'd stick that in there to remind you—$2 a gallon.\nMeanwhile, we've doubled our production of renewable energy. We've become the world leader in fighting climate change. We've brought home more of our men and women in uniform, including many of the proud servicemembers who had to travel out of Fort Bragg to go into harm's way. We took out Usama bin Laden. We've got ISIL on the run. We're more respected around the world than we were when I came in.\nMeanwhile, here at home, high school graduation rates at an alltime high; college graduation, alltime high. Millions of young people are able to get Pell grants who weren't getting them before.\nWe've made sure that we reinvigorated the voting rights division of the Justice Department, working on criminal justice reform. Made sure that in all 50 States, people have the freedom to marry who they love.\nAnd it's been hard work. And there have been times where we've had setbacks, and there have been times where some of you may have felt discouraged. But I tell you why I didn't get discouraged. I didn't get discouraged because of you. I didn't get discouraged because over these 8 years, I traveled across all 50 States. I went to big cities. I went to small towns. I went to suburbs and rural areas. I met people from every background and every faith and every party, and I saw what makes America great: I saw you. I saw you. And I saw you working together in neighborhoods and in your towns, in your cities, in your churches, in your congregations.\nI saw young and old, men and women, Black, White, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, people with disabilities, gay and straight, all pledging allegiance to the red, white, and blue. That's the America I know.\nAnd there is only one candidate in this race in 2016 who has devoted her life to helping to build that better America, and that's the next President of the United States, Hillary Rodham Clinton.\nBut we can't take it for granted. We can't be complacent. All the progress that we've made these last 8 years goes out the window if we don't win this election. So we've got to work our hearts out this week, these last 4 days, as if our future depends on it, because our future depends on it.\nAnd I know sometimes at the end of campaigns, there are so many negative ads on TV, there is so much noise, so much distraction, a lot of okey-doke out there. [Laughter] They want to bamboozle you. [Laughter] I want you to tune all that out, and I want you to focus on the choice that we actually face in this election. Because if you just focus, if you just think about it, the choice could not be simpler, it could not be clearer. There is a reason that so many Republicans, so many conservatives have denounced the nominee of their party. It's never happened before. You've never seen a situation in which folks are denouncing the person who's nominated as their party leader. And it's because Donald Trump is uniquely unqualified to be President. He is temperamentally unfit to be Commander in Chief.\nListen, if you want to keep our military the greatest fighting force that the world has ever known, if you want America to stay strong and respected, then we can't have a Commander in Chief who suggests that it's okay to torture people, that suggests that we should ban entire religions from our country.\nWe can't afford a Commander in Chief who insults POWs or attacks——\n[At this point, there was a disruption in the audience.]\nThe President. No, wait, wait, wait. Hold up. Hold up. Hold up. Hey, hold up! Hold up! Hold up! No, it's okay. Hey! Hold up! Hold up! Hold up!\nAudience members. Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!\nThe President. Hey, listen, listen, listen——\nAudience members. Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!\nThe President. Hey, hey, hey, listen up! Hey, everybody! Everybody! Hey! Hey! Listen up! Hey! I told you to be focused, and you're not focused right now! Listen to what I'm saying. Hold up! Hold up! Hold up! Everybody sit down and be quiet for a second. Everybody sit down and be quiet for a second.\nNow, listen up! I'm serious, listen up. You've got an older gentleman who is supporting his candidate. He's not doing nothing. You don't have to worry about him. You should—this is what I mean about folks not being focused.\nFirst of all, we—hold up! Hold up! First of all, we live in a country that respects free speech. So, second of all, it looks like maybe he might have served in our military, and we've got to respect that. Third of all, he was elderly, and we've got to respect our elders. And fourth of all, don't boo.\nAudience members. Vote!\nThe President. Vote! Don't boo, vote! Come on.\nNow, I want you to pay attention. Because if we don't—if we lose focus, we could have problems. This is part of what's happened here during this election season. We just get stirred up for all kinds of reasons that are unnecessary. Just relax. [Laughter]\nNow, I want to remind you what I was saying. We can't afford a Commander in Chief who insults POWs, who attacks a Gold Star mother, who actually talks down our troops, says he knows more than our generals. Even a Republican Senator said we can't afford to give somebody like that the nuclear codes, somebody so erratic. I want you to think about that.\nWhen I was sworn in as President, the next day I'm sitting down—actually not the next day, that, just right afterwards—I had to sit down with somebody who explained this whole nuclear thing. It will sober you up. [Laughter] It's serious business. We can't have somebody like that handling our nuclear codes. We can't have somebody who gets upset because \"Saturday Night Live\" does a skit about him—[laughter]—and starts tweeting at 3 o'clock in the morning. That's not the temperament that you want for somebody who has got the nuclear codes.\nSo if you believe that America is stronger when everybody does their part, if you believe that America is stronger when everyone pays their fair share, then we can't elect the first candidate in decades who refuses to release any tax returns, admits he has not paid Federal income tax in years; somebody who stiffs small businesspeople who do work for him or workers who've done work for him and he owes them.\nBut he says, I won't pay you because, you know what, I've got more lawyers than you. The notion that somebody like that is going to be the champion of working people—somebody who exploits working people, somebody who probably doesn't know any working people except the person who cleans up and the person who mows the fairway at his golf course—how can that person be a champion for working people?\nIf you cherish our Constitution, we can't elect a President who threatens to shut down the press when they say something he doesn't like; who threatens to throw his opponents in jail; who discriminates against people of different faiths. Our Constitution does not allow that. There are places around the world where that's acceptable, but that's not the United States of America.\nIf you believe we're stronger together, then we can't elect a President who vilifies minorities, mocks Americans with disabilities, calls immigrants criminals and rapists. We can't elect a President who brags that being famous allows him to get away with something that, if you read the description, qualifies as sexual assault; who calls women pigs and dogs and slobs, and grades them on a scale of 1 to 10. That's not America. This is not a Democrat or a Republican. That's not America.\nMichelle and I, we've got two magnificent daughters. And they are primarily magnificent because Michelle is magnificent. And they're smart, and they're cute, just like their mama. But the thing I'm so proud of them is that they're kind and they're generous. And we've taught them to respect everybody; that nobody is higher than you, but nobody is lower than you, and you don't lift yourself up by putting somebody else down. Those values that we've taught our children, that you're teaching your children and your grandchildren, we can't have a President who every day seems to violate those basic values.\nAnd the problem is, is that he's done it so much that it's become almost normal. It's like suddenly reality TV has entered into the race for the Presidency. It's not even \"Survivor\" or \"The Bachelorette.\" I mean it's like some \"Love and Hip Hop\" stuff. [Laughter] I mean it's just—some stuff that, up until this election, we would have said is completely disqualifying. And yet somehow, everybody has gotten accustomed to it, acting like it's normal.\nAnd we hear people justifying it and making excuses about it and saying, \"Well, you know, he didn't really mean it,\" or, \"It's locker room talk,\" or, \"Well, maybe he did mean it, but as long as he supports tax cuts for the rich or as long as he supports doing the things we want to do, then it's okay.\" Come on, man. That—we can't be thinking somehow that just because he agrees with you on some policy issue, or just because you're frustrated with Government, that it's okay to display the kind of behavior he displays.\nBecause I want to tell you something about this office that I've been in for 8 years: Who you are, what you are does not change once you become President. It will magnify who you are. You have more power so as a consequence, folks will enable you to be more who you are. It will shine a spotlight on who you are. But if you disrespected women before you were in office, then you will disrespect women once you take office. If you accept the support of Klan sympathizers, if you don't denounce them right away because you're kind of not sure, well, that's what you're going to do when you're in office. If you disrespect the Constitution when you're running for President, then not only will you disrespect it once you become President, but you actually might be able to violate the Constitution once you're President.\nAnd the reason I say all this is because, yes, I am a proud Democrat, but we're not Democrats or Republicans first. We're children of God first. We are Americans first. We are human beings first. I've got Republican friends who don't think or act the way Donald Trump is acting, and as a consequence, they're not voting for him, even if they disagree with Democratic policies. This is somebody different, uniquely unqualified to do the job.\nBut the good news is, North Carolina, all of you are uniquely qualified to make sure he doesn't get the job. You just have to vote. You just have to vote. And the good news is you don't have to just vote against somebody, you can vote for somebody. Because there is somebody who's smart, and who's steady, and who's tested; somebody who I believe is as qualified as any person ever to run for this office. She is my friend. I trust her. She will be an outstanding President. And her name is Hillary Clinton, and I need you to vote for her.\nThis is somebody who has dedicated her life to making this country better. Think about how she got started. At the same time, Donald Trump and his developer father were being sued by the Justice Department for denying housing to African American families, Hillary was going undercover from school to school to make sure minority kids were getting an equal shot at a good education. That's who she is. That's her values. And she has not stopped fighting for justice and equality ever since.\nHer heart has always been in the right place. But it's not just her heart. She's smart. She does her homework. She works hard every single day. I know. She worked hard when she was running against me. [Laughter] Then I said, boy, that woman worked so hard, I need her to work for me. [Laughter] And I saw up close her outstanding work. She was in the Situation Room making arguments to go after bin Laden when it was a risky proposition. She circled the globe again and again as Secretary of State, earned the respect of world leaders.\nShe was outstanding in her job. She was loyal to me. Her efforts were not flashy. They weren't always fully appreciated. That happens sometimes to women. You know, you go up into some church here in Fayetteville, tell you, look who's doing the work. They're not always out front, but you know who's doing the work.\nShe made me a better President. She actually understands the world, understands the challenges we face; doesn't have to have somebody explain to her the difference between a Sunni and a Shia. [Laughter] Doesn't have to have somebody explain the difference between Ukraine and Lithuania. [Laughter] She can find them on a map.\nAnd by the way, when things don't go her way, she doesn't whine. She doesn't complain. She doesn't blame somebody else. She doesn't say the game is rigged. She just works harder, comes back stronger. Gets up when she gets knocked down, dusts herself off, keeps on going. She will be a smart and a steady President.\nAnd by the way, Deborah Ross will be the same kind of Senator if you give her the chance. She has heard your stories. She has fought on behalf of working families, and she'll keep fighting so they get a fair shot, so kids get a great education, so seniors get the secure retirement they've earned. And by the way, unlike her opponent, she doesn't support Donald Trump.\nShe's running against Senator Richard Burr. Now, I know Richard Burr. He and I came into the Senate together. And we worked out sometimes at the gym. We'd be there at the same time. He's a perfectly nice guy to talk to. But he seems to be willing to say anything just to get elected.\nSo he said the other day, there is not a separation between me and Donald Trump. Now, that's a problem. So either he's telling the truth, and that's a problem, or he's just saying it because he thinks it will help him get elected. That's still a problem. [Laughter]\nAnd he started to—he's been starting to adopt some of the habits of Donald Trump, like he actually joked about violence against Hillary. We've been hearing a lot of that lately—just some loose talk that's dangerous. He apologized, but the problem is, is that the fact that he said it in the first place means that he has become part of this whole kind of reality TV—say anything, do anything, insult anybody, whatever-it-takes-to-get-elected kind of attitude. And you know what, that's not what North Carolina is about.\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. That's what—that's not what America is about. I always say, when I come to North Carolina, the thing I love about North Carolina, even the folks who don't vote for me are nice. [Laughter] Because folks got some good home training. You don't go around making jokes like that.\nSo the bottom line is, is that Deborah needs to get elected right alongside of Hillary. Because for Hillary to continue to make the progress that we've made, she's got to have allies like Deborah Ross in the Senate. You cannot elect Hillary and then stick her with the kind of Congress that's behaving the way they've been behaving.\nThey did not work with me when I took office, even though we were in the middle of a great recession, would not lift a finger. They decided it's better for our politics just to say no. And now they're promising more dysfunction. I don't know how you could have more dysfunction than you've got right now out of them, but they're promising more. They're going to try to come up with something. So they're already saying, we're going to have years of hearings and investigations of Hillary. We're going to have more shutdowns, more obstruction, more repeal votes of the health care act.\nAudience member. Wasting our tax dollars!\nThe President. Wasting our tax dollars. Who said that? That's what you said?\nRichard Burr, Deborah's opponent, said that if Hillary wins, he will do everything he can to block all Supreme Court nominations. Now, keep in mind, 11 years ago, he said a Supreme Court without nine justices wouldn't work. Well, what changed? Only Republican Presidents get to nominate judges now?\nSome Republicans are suggesting that they might start impeachment hearings against Hillary. She's not even elected yet. Come on. You can't do that. That ain't right. Not only is it not right, but it ain't right!\nListen, listen, gridlock—you hear a lot about gridlock. Gridlock is not some mysterious fog that just kind of drops down on Washington. Gridlock is not the Democrats and the Republicans just both being equally unreasonable. Gridlock is happening, has happened, will happen when Republican politicians like Richard Burr decide they will oppose anything that's good for the country just because a Democrat proposes it.\nSo if you think \"Endless gridlock\" is a good slogan, then you should vote for Richard Burr. You should vote for Republicans. But if you believe America can do better, if you care about creating jobs for families here in Fayetteville, if you think that we should help a single mom get affordable childcare so she can go to work, if you think women should be paid the same as men for doing the same job, if you think we should be able to raise the minimum wage so working people get a fair shake, if you think that people who are working hard deserve respect—then you've got to vote for the Democrat up and down the ticket. You've got to vote for Hillary. You've got to vote for Deborah Ross. You've got to vote for Roy Cooper. You've got to vote for people who put you ahead of politics and are ready to move the country forward.\nSo, North Carolina, let me close by saying——\nAudience member. We love you!\nThe President. I love you, too. But let me—I do. You know I do. But let me finish up by just saying this.\nAudience member. We love you.\nThe President. I do too.\nBut listen, there is something—hold on a second. There is something more fundamental at stake in this election than just politics. This election is going to say something about who we are as a country. Hillary tells me when she was young, her mom taught her the Methodist creed: \"Do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, as long as you can.\" That's her values. That's her north star—the idea we can summon what's best in each of us to make this country better for all of us.\nThat's what America is about. We are a country like no other; a place founded for the sake of an idea. It's not because we have the biggest buildings or we've got the most powerful military. It's because we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal. That we are endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights.\nWe don't have to be rich, don't have to be privileged, don't have to look a certain way or have a certain name in order to make a contribution. Which is why patriots fought against tyranny to create this country, why our GIs defeated fascism. It's what gave women the courage to reach for the ballot and marchers to cross a bridge in Selma. It's what allowed workers to organize for better wages and better benefits. That's what's made America exceptional. That's what makes America great.\nAnd it hasn't happened because somebody did it for us. When I ran in '08, I didn't say, \"Yes, I can.\" What did I say?\nAudience members. \"Yes, we can!\"\nThe President. I said, \"Yes, we can.\" This is about what we can achieve together. Us. Through self-government. And Hillary understands that. She knows we've got a big country and a diverse country and not everybody is going to agree all the time. But we don't demonize each other. She knows issues aren't always black and white, so we've got to compromise sometimes, even when you think you're right. She knows none of us are perfect, including our Presidents, but we should at least try to conduct ourselves with some basic decency, some basic consideration for others. So I know a lot of you sometimes may feel cynical and fed up about politics. And there's a lot about this election that might give you a reason to be cynical. But I am telling you right now—and especially the young people I'm talking to right now—you know, it isn't that often where, in your life, you've got a chance to move history. It's not that often where you have the chance to bend the arc of history in the direction of justice. It's not that often where you know you can make a difference. This is one of those moments.\nRight now you can reject the mean-spirited politics that would take us backwards. Right now you can elect a leader who has spent her entire life trying to move this country forward. Our first female President: an example for our daughters and our sons.\nYou have a chance to shape history. Don't let that slip away. Don't fall for the easy cynicism that tells you politics doesn't matter, my vote doesn't matter, everybody—all, they're all crooked, it's all the same. That's what those who have been opposed to me and now oppose Hillary, they want you to think that way so you don't vote. And by the way, here in North Carolina, there have been Republican politicians who have actually been trying to keep you from voting.\nA few years ago, Roy Cooper's opponent, Governor McCrory, signed a law that made it harder for African Americans to vote. And, look, I'm not—this is me—this is not me just opining. A Federal judge looked at all the evidence, said this law targeted Black voters with \"surgical precision.\" That's a quote. One of the worst voter suppression laws in the country. Right now, Donald Trump is calling on his supporters to monitor \"certain areas\" on election day. I don't know what \"certain areas\" he's talking about, but you do. No wonder Governor McCrory calls Donald Trump a role model.\nThis is not an accident. Think about—I want you to think about a woman I know named Grace Bell Hardison. She lives in Belhaven, North Carolina. She's lived there her entire life—she's a hundred years old. A few weeks ago, Republicans challenged her voter registration status, trying to remove her from the voter rolls. She has never left the county in a hundred years—a hundred years. The list of voters Republicans tried to purge was two-thirds Black and Democratic. And it was happening in counties across the State.\nSo, young people, I want you to understand this. There was a time when systematically denying Black folks the right to vote, that, too, was considered normal. It wasn't that long ago when folks had to guess the number of jellybeans in a jar, the number of bubbles on a bar of soap. It wasn't long ago when folks were beaten trying to register voters in Mississippi. So the idea that you would give your vote away, that you would sit there and not even take the 15 minutes to walk across the street and vote.\nYesterday, Grace Bell Hardison sent me a letter, and I want you to know what she wrote. \"Dear Mr. President, at a hundred years old, you can believe I have seen it all. [Laughter] It is by God's grace that I am still able to be here with my family. . . . I lived through the civil rights era. I know the blood that was shed in the name of the right to vote. I remember how hard Dr. King and many civil rights lawyers fought for the right to vote. I remember the victories they won for me and the generations after me. I can assure you, Mr. President, that I will keep fighting on. If I haven't stopped fighting at 100 years old, then neither can you.\"\nNow, Miss Hardison got her voter registration reinstated. You better believe she's going to vote. They targeted the wrong woman—hundred years old, could be our great-grandmother; great-great-grandmother. It's bad enough she was disrespected. Are we now also going to disrespect her because we're not voting when she fought so hard to make sure she can vote? If she hasn't stopped fighting at a hundred years old, neither can we. If she's not tired, I'm not tired. If she's not tired, then I can keep on working to make sure everybody votes.\nIf you've been marching for criminal justice reform, that's great, but you still need to vote! If you care about the environment, that's great, but you need to vote! If you care about making sure our veterans get treated fairly and get the benefits they've earned, that's great, but you need to vote!\nYou need to vote. Because I know this: that if you vote, we'll win North Carolina. And if we win North Carolina, Hillary Clinton will be President. And Deborah Ross will be Senator. And Roy Cooper will be Governor.\nUnderstand the stakes. Understand the stakes here. My name is not on the ballot. But everything we've worked for is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot! Equality is on the ballot! Jobs are on the ballot! Health care is on the ballot! Criminal justice reform is on the ballot! Democracy is on the ballot!\nI need you to vote! Don't choose fear, choose hope. Don't choose fear, choose hope. Don't choose fear, choose hope. Go out there and vote. And if you do, we'll remind the entire world why America is the greatest nation on Earth.\nGod bless you, Fayetteville. God bless the United States of America.

Policy. As articulated in the National Strategy for Countering Biological Threats and implemented in Presidential Policy Directive 2 (PPD-2), promoting global health security is a core tenet of our national strategy for countering biological threats. No single nation can be prepared if other nations remain unprepared to counter biological threats; therefore, it is the policy of the United States to advance the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA), which is a multi-faceted, multi-country initiative intended to accelerate partner countries' measurable capabilities to achieve specific targets to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats (GHSA targets), whether naturally occurring, deliberate, or accidental. The roles, responsibilities, and activities described in this order will support the goals of the International Health Regulations (IHR) and will be conducted, as appropriate, in coordination with the World Health Organization (WHO), Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL), and other relevant organizations and stakeholders. To advance the achievement of the GHSA targets and to support the implementation of the IHR within partner countries, each executive department, agency, and office (agency) shall, as appropriate, partner, consult, and coordinate with other governments, international financial institutions, international organizations, regional organizations, economic communities, and nongovernmental stakeholders, including the private sector.\nSec. 2.

Hello, Charlotte! Are you fired up? Fired up! Fired up!\nOh, let me tell you something, Dennis got me fired up! Can everybody please give him a big round of applause? I feel a little bit like the guest pastor coming into church. [Laughter] He got me fired up backstage.\nThere's some people I want to thank. First of all, outstanding Congresswoman Alma Adams is here. Your next State treasurer, Dan Blue III is here. Your next Governor, Roy Cooper, is in the house. Your outstanding mayor of Charlotte, Jennifer Roberts, is here. And all of you are here.\nThis is a pretty good crowd right here. So I just want to say to you: 4 days.\nAudience members. Four days!\nThe President. Four days, North Carolina.\nAudience members. Four days!\nThe President. Four days to decide the future of this country that we love. Now, the good news is you don't have to wait 4 days, because here in North Carolina, you can vote early. If you are not registered to vote, you have until tomorrow to register and vote at any of the one-stop locations in your county. There are two within a few miles from here: UNC-Charlotte, at the Cone Center—these guys right here, they'll show you where to go if you need to—or University City Regional Library.\nAnd if those don't work for you, then you can go to iwillvote.com, and they'll show you where to vote. But when I see something that says \"Carolina Votes\" up there, I just want to make sure that whoever put up that sign isn't telling a lie. I need you to vote. The country needs you to vote. Because, I don't know about you, but I like to finish what I start. I like finishing what I start. And we need to finish what we started 8 years ago.\nNow, I realize I'm kind of gray now. You say I still look good, though, right? Okay. Michelle says that, too. [Laughter] But it makes me realize that back in 2008, some of you were 10. [Laughter] Some of you who are acting like you're grown now and you're in college, but back then you were watching the Disney Channel. So let me refresh your memory about where we were when I visited Charlotte in the final days of the 2008 campaign.\nWe were living through two long and painful wars. We were about to enter into the worst economic crisis in our lifetimes. But because of you, because of the American people, we battled back from what might have been a Great Depression. Last year, we saw incomes rise at the fastest pace in four decades. We saw poverty fall at the fastest pace since 1968.\nWe've created 15½ million new jobs. The unemployment rate is down to 4.9 percent, near its 9-year low. Twenty million people have health insurance that didn't have it before. We kicked our addiction to foreign oil. We doubled our production of renewable energy, including right here in Carolina. You've been a leader. America became a world leader in fighting climate change. And, by the way, we did all that, and gas is two bucks a gallon. Back in 2008, they said if you elect Obama, it's going to be six bucks a gallon. It's two bucks a gallon. Thanks, Obama.\nWe brought home more of our men and women in uniform who had sacrificed so much for our security. We took out Usama bin Laden. We've got ISIL on the run.\nHere at home, we've seen the highest high school graduation rates on record. Highest college attendance and graduation rates. Provided Pell grants to millions more young people who didn't have them before. And by the way, we made sure that in all 50 States you can marry the person you love.\nNow, the reason this happened wasn't just luck. It had to do with some policies that were thought through. But it most of all had to do with our greatest asset, and that is you, the American people. People of every party, people of every faith, people of every color, creed, background, who understand we are stronger together. That it shouldn't matter the circumstances in which we're born, we should be able to live out our dreams. That it shouldn't matter whether you're young or old, Black or White, Latino, Asian, Native American, whether you've got a disability, whether you're gay or straight, we all pledge allegiance to the red, white, and blue. We all love this country. We all want to move it forward. That's the America I know.\nAnd there is only one candidate in this race who understands that be—and she has devoted her life to creating a better America, and that's the next President of the United States, Hillary Rodham Clinton.\nNow, this should not be a close race.\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. But it's going to be a close race. It's going to be especially close here in North Carolina. And I want everybody to understand, all the progress we've made, everything we've fought for, everything we aspire to, all of that goes out the window if we don't win this election. So we've got to work our hearts out this week, over the next 4 days. We've got to work like our future depends on it. Because, you know what? Our future depends on it.\nAnd that also means we've got to block out the noise. I know here in North Carolina, you are tired of all those ads on TV. It just gets you depressed, and there's so much noise and so much distraction, so much stuff that has nothing to do with your lives, so much stuff that's made up and fabricated. And so there's a temptation to want to just tune it out. But I want you to focus on the choice that we face in this election, because if you block out the noise and the distraction, the okey-doke, the nonsense, the hype, the misinformation, if you block all of that out, the choice could not be simpler, it could not be clearer.\nI mean, there is a reason why, in an unprecedented fashion, you have Republicans and conservatives, who aren't running for office so they feel it's safe to do so, to denounce Donald Trump. And the reason is, is because Hillary's opponent, Donald Trump, is uniquely unqualified to be President; is temperamentally unfit to be Commander in Chief. And the fact that he has gotten this far tells me the degree to which our politics has become like a bad reality TV show.\nListen, if you want to keep our military the greatest fighting force in the world, if you want America to stay strong and respected around the world, you can't have a Commander in Chief who says it's okay to torture people. You can't have somebody who suggests that we can ban entire religions from our country. Audience members. Boo!\nThe President. Don't boo.\nAudience members. Vote!\nThe President. Vote! He can't hear your boos, but he can hear your votes. A boo don't get you nowhere. Voting gets you someplace.\nWe can't afford a Commander in Chief who insults POWs, attacks a Gold Star mom, says he's going to be his own foreign policy adviser because he says he's got a \"good brain.\" [Laughter] Who says that? [Laughter]\nNo, listen, I'm serious. If, like, you just knew somebody, some guy in your office or somebody at school, and they're all, like, \"No, I've got a good brain,\" what would you think? You would not put that guy in charge of nothing. Come on, man. You can't do that. Listen, you know, you can't have somebody as your Commander in Chief who doesn't know the difference between Iraq and Iran; who doesn't know the difference between Lithuania and Latvia. Even a Republican Senator said we can't afford to give the nuclear codes to somebody that erratic. Now, think about that. We are talking about somebody being responsible for the nuclear codes. Right after you get sworn in, somebody comes and says, okay, Mr. President, here is what you've got to know. It's serious. You sit there and you go, oh, okay, this is serious.\nSo you can't have that person, as he is getting briefed, thinking \"Saturday Night Live\" insulted me, now I'm going to send a tweet. You can't have that. You've got to have somebody who's focused, because this is serious business.\nIf you think that America is stronger when everybody does their part, and everybody does their fair share, you can't elect a candidate, the first in decades, who refuses to release any tax returns. We don't know who he does business with. We don't know who he owes favors to. We have no idea.\nAnd what we do know is, because he's bragged about the fact that he's a really smart businessman, from his perspective that mean he doesn't pay Federal income taxes, and stiffs small businesses that did work for him, and stiffs workers what he owes them, and puts his name on a phony university that tricks people into paying up money and getting nothing for it.\nThe idea that this guy claims to be the voice for working people, someone who exploits working people, who probably doesn't know any working people except the guy who's cleaning up in his hotel and the guy who's mowing the lawn in his fairway. Come on. I know a lot of successful businesspeople. They don't go around cheating people to be successful.\nIf you cherish our Constitution, how can we elect a President who threatens, seriously, to shut down press that reports things he doesn't like? Or suggests that he might throw his opponent in jail in a Presidential debate? Or feels comfortable suggesting we discriminate against people of different faiths? Our Constitution does not allow that. You don't have to go to law school to know that. You've just got to read one of those pocket Constitutions that Mr. Khan was handing out. It's right there under the Bill of Rights.\nThere are places in the world where that might be acceptable, but this isn't one of them. This is the United States of America. We've got laws. We've got rights.\nHow could we possibly elect a President who feels comfortable—no, let me change that—who, for political purposes, deliberately vilifies minorities? Thinks it's funny to mock Americans with disabilities? Has no compunction in suggesting that women be treated as objects? Who brags about how being famous allows him to get away with something that is the definition of sexual assault, that we're trying to fight on college campuses right now, that we're trying to get rid of in those instances where it happens in our Armed Forces?\nYou're the Commander in Chief. You're supposed to be setting an example. And you've got somebody who wants to be elected President who calls women pigs or slobs or dogs, or grades them on a scale of 1 to 10.\nListen, I have two magnificent daughters because I have a magnificent wife. And they are strong, and they are smart, and they are full of character, and they are kind. And there is nothing they cannot do. And we have taught them not just to respect others, but to respect themselves. The idea that we would put in place in the most prominent, most powerful office in the land somebody who undermines that?\nAnd the worst part about it, Charlotte, is we have begun to treat this as if it's normal. Every day, this is a candidate who has said things that just 4 years ago, just 8 years ago, 12, we would have considered completely disqualifying. I mean, imagine if in 2008 I had said any of the things that this man said. Just imagine it. Imagine if I had behaved in the way this man behaved. Imagine what Republicans would have said. Imagine what the press would have said.\nBut now we act like, I guess, this is normal.\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. As if it's some parody. You can't tell the difference between \"Saturday Night Live\" and what's actually happening on the news. [Laughter]\nAnd then, we hear people who are voting for him justifying it. They say, well, he doesn't really mean it. Or they say, well, that's just locker room talk. Although I've been in a lot of locker rooms; I never heard that. Or they say, well, you know what, we really don't like that, we really don't like this, but as long as he helps us potentially get tax cuts for the wealthy passed, or as long as he's willing to roll back Obamacare so 20 million people don't have health insurance anymore, as long as he's willing to do the things we want to do, then it's okay, we can ignore these elements of his character.\nBut I want all of you to understand something. I've been in this office now 8 years. And—[applause]—no, no, no, hold on, hold up. Hold on. I want you to pay attention here, because it's been interesting to watch the evolution of—and the realization that I arrived at during the course of this campaign and then the Presidency. Who you are, what you are does not change after you become President. It magnifies it. It shines a spotlight on it. You may be tested, and you may see who you are, but it doesn't fundamentally change who you are.\nSo if you disrespected women before you were President, you'll disrespect women after you're President. If, as Dennis said, you accept the support of Klan sympathizers before you were President, are kind of slow in disowning it, saying, \"Well, I don't know,\" that's how you'll be when you're President. If you disrespect the Constitution when you're running for President, you'll disrespect the Constitution even after you've sworn an oath to uphold and protect it.\nAnd the reason that's important to understand is, because I'm a proud Democrat. But—[applause]—no, hold on. I can honestly say to myself that if we as Democrats had nominated somebody who said the things Mr. Trump said, then I'd have to say, I'm sorry. Yes, I'm a Democrat, but I'm an American first. I'm a human being first. I'm a father first. I'm a husband first. And there are Republicans who have done that. I have a—Republican friends who don't think or act the way Donald Trump does, and they don't intend to vote for him because they understand this is somebody different who is uniquely unqualified to hold this job.\nAnd the good news, though, North Carolina, is that you are uniquely qualified to make sure he doesn't get the job. But you've got to vote. You can't just sit on the sidelines. You've got to vote. You can't just complain. You've got to vote. You can't just get depressed and crawl up in the fetal position, and look at the online polling and go, oh, what's going to—no, you've just got to vote!\nAnd the good news is, you don't have to just vote against somebody. You can vote for somebody, because there's a candidate who's actually worthy of your vote. A candidate who is smart and is steady and is tested, probably the most qualified person ever to run for this office: our next President, Hillary Clinton!\nYou know, I will tell you, as I've been watching this thing unfold, it has been a source of some frustration to me to see the degree to which Hillary's reality diverges from what you see in the media and on the news and on the blogs and all that, because this is somebody who has devoted her life to making this country better. This is somebody who has always fought on behalf of working people, has always fought on behalf of the vulnerable. Somebody who has worked tirelessly for civil rights.\nThink about how she got her start. When Donald Trump and his dad were being sued by the Justice Department for denying housing to African American families, Hillary was going undercover from school to school to make sure minority kids were getting an equal shot at a good education. That's at the start of her career. And she didn't stop: working with the Children's Defense Fund, working as First Lady, working as a U.S. Senator, working as a Secretary of State.\nHer heart has always been in the right place. She works hard every single day. I know, because I ran against her. [Laughter] I got worn out. [Laughter] And I said, she's so smart and hardworking, let—come on, work with me. And she made me a better President. She was in the Situation Room when we made the decision to go after bin Laden. She circled the globe tirelessly, earning the respect of world leaders. She did her homework. She was well prepared. She wasn't flashy. She was loyal. She had my back. She had the American people's back. She understands the world. She understands the challenges that we face. And when things don't go her way, she doesn't whine, she doesn't complain, she doesn't say the game is rigged.\nYou know what, I—you know, Malia and Sasha, they used to have, like, soccer when they were kids—little kids—7, 8. They'd be running around, just all circling around the ball. You know how they don't know how to spread out; they're just like running around. [Laughter] And sometimes, they'd lose; sometimes, they'd win. But the one thing that I always taught Malia and Sasha—and I'm sure the parents here who have kids in sports teach you—is you don't complain when things aren't going your way. You don't whine. There's no crying in baseball. [Laughter] You just come back and you work harder and you do better. And that's what Hillary Clinton does. If she gets knocked down, she gets back up. She dusts herself off. She gets back to work. She'll be a great President as long as, Carolina, you vote for Hillary Clinton for President!\nAnd, by the way, Deborah Ross will be the same kind of Senator if you give her a shot. I've gotten a chance to know Deborah. This is an outstanding woman. She has heard your stories. She's going to fight to give working families a fair shot, our kids a great education, our seniors a secure retirement. And unlike her opponent, she does not support Donald Trump. So you can't just stop voting. You can't just stop by voting for Hillary. You've got to go down the ballot. You've got to vote for Roy Cooper. You've got to vote for Deborah Ross.\nYou know, Senator Richard Burr, who Deborah is running against——\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. Don't boo. What are we going to do?\nAudience members. Vote!\nThe President. Vote!\nHe said just a while back, \"There's not a separation between me and Donald Trump.\" Now, you think about that.\nAudience members. What?\nThe President. What?\nAudience members. What?\nThe President. What? [Laughter]\nNot a separation. Two things are possible there. Either he really does think like Donald Trump, in which case you don't want him in the United States Senate representing Carolina. Or he's just saying he agrees with Donald Trump because he thinks it will help him get elected, in which case you don't want him representing North Carolina in the United States Senate.\nThe other day, he joked about violence against Hillary Clinton. He went on to apologize. And, you know, I know Richard Burr, and I suspect he didn't actually mean it. But the problem is, is that they've become so accustomed to saying these things in their rallies and in their town halls and on the Internet, it becomes an applause line. And it's become normalized, the idea of making a joke about violence against somebody who is running for President or is President. There's a reason why we've got Secret Service. There's nothing normal about that. And that's not what North Carolina is about. That's not what America is about.\nSo if you want Hillary Clinton to continue the progress we've made, then you've got to give her allies like Deborah Ross. You can't just elect Hillary and stick her with a Republican Congress that's been behaving the way they've been behaving. They have not been willing to work with me, even when we were trying to prevent a Great Depression. They wouldn't do stuff even when it originally was their idea. I'd, like, go through their list of things they wanted to do, and I'd say, okay, I want to do this too. Let's do it. They'd say, oh, well, now that you're for it, we can't be for it.\nNow they're promising even more dysfunction in Washington. That is hard to do. [Laughter] They're promising years of hearings and investigations. They're promising more shutdowns, more obstruction, more repeal votes. Deborah's opponent just said, if Hillary wins, he'll do everything he can to block all Supreme Court nominations. Never in history have we seen that attitude. Eleven years ago, the same guy said a Supreme Court could not function without nine justices. So what changed all the sudden? The reason they say they're not confirming my nominee, Merrick Garland, who everybody acknowledges is an outstanding jurist, is they said, \"We're going to let the American people decide; it's too close to the election.\" Now we're getting close to the election, and they're saying, \"Well, if Hillary wins, we might not nominate him anyway.\" I—what happened? Only Republican Presidents get to nominate judges now?\nYou've got some Republicans who are actually suggesting they will impeach Hillary. She's not elected yet. They can't even tell you what it is they'll impeach her for. They just decided, that's how we're going to roll, that's what we're going to do; we are good at saying no because we can't say yes to anything; we can't pass our own stuff; we don't know what we stand for, but we do know if we block everything from happening, no matter how much it damages the American people, it might advantage us in an election.\nListen, gridlock—gridlock is not some mysterious fog that descends on Washington. Gridlock is not the result of Democrats and Republicans being equally unreasonable. Gridlock has happened because Republicans like Richard Burr have decided they're going to oppose anything, no matter how good it is for the country, because a Democrat proposes it or because they're worried about their Republican voters not liking it. So if you think a vote for gridlock is good, you should vote Republican.\nBut if you think America can do better than that, if you care about creating jobs for families in your neighborhoods, if you care about childcare for single moms who are trying to get to work, if you care about equal pay for equal work and raising the minimum wage, if you care about making sure that we're rebuilding our roads and our bridges and our airports, rebuilding America, then you need to vote for Democrats up and down the ticket. You need to vote for Hillary Clinton and vote for Deborah Ross, vote for Roy Cooper, people who will put you ahead of politics, people who are ready to roll up their sleeves and move this country forward.\nSo let me just say this: If you are not yet persuaded, I want you to understand, there is something more fundamental at stake in this election than just policies and programs. What's at stake right now is the character of our country. Hillary Clinton says her mom taught her the Methodist creed: Do all you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, as long as you can. That is her idea of America. Those are the values she wants to summon for all of us to make this country better. That's what this country is all about.\nWe are a nation like no other, not because we're the largest or the richest or we've got the biggest military. We are exceptional because this country was founded for a sake of an idea: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal. That we're endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights. You don't have to be born into wealth or privilege to make a difference in this country. You don't have to practice a certain faith or have a certain last name in order to be successful in this country.\nThat idea is what drove patriots to choose revolution over tyranny. It's what led our GIs to defeat fascism an ocean away. It's what gave women the courage to reach for the ballot; gave marchers the courage to cross that bridge in Selma; gave workers the courage to organize for collective bargaining and better wages. That's what's made America exceptional. That's what's made America great.\nAnd the thing about it is, North Carolina, it doesn't depend on somebody up on high, doesn't depend on somebody doing it for us. It's what we do for ourselves. It's what we do for each other. It's achieved by us, together, through the hard and sometimes frustrating, but ultimately necessary work of self-government.\nWhen I ran in '08, I didn't say, \"Yes, I can.\" I said, \"Yes, we can.\" You and me. All of us. Justice Louis Brandeis once said, the most important office in a democracy is not President or Senator or mayor, it's the office of citizen. That's what this has always been about: What can we do together? And so the question right now is, what are we going to do together? Because if you vote, if you vote, we will win North Carolina.\nBut we're going to have to do it together. You can't just depend on somebody else to do it. That's what Hillary understands. She understands this is a big, diverse country, a big, diverse democracy. We only succeed when citizens are involved and paying attention. And that's why it's so important that we understand, even when we disagree with somebody, that we can engage with them. We don't demonize other people. We're willing to compromise even when we think we're right. We don't try to burn the house down when we don't get our way. She understands that.\nBut she needs help. She needs your help. You can't sit on the sidelines on this one, especially here in North Carolina. Because some of you may be aware there was a time when African Americans couldn't vote here in North Carolina. You had to figure out how many jelly beans were in a jar. You had to figure out how many bubbles there were on a bar of soap. You may also know that just recently, this Governor who is currently in place signed a law that a Federal judge said with \"surgical precision\" was trying to discriminate and prevent people from voting.\nNow, that law has been suspended, which is why it matters that we have an independent judiciary. It matters that we have a Constitution. But can you imagine, after all the battles that have been waged, after all the blood, sweat, and tears to give us the right to a voice in our democracy, after all the hardship, all the struggle, that some of us would choose to give away our birthright, give away our power, give away our voice because we couldn't go across the street and spend 15 minutes to determine who it was that we're going to make fundamental decisions about our lives?\nIf that idea doesn't upset you, I want to tell you about a woman named Grace Bell Hardison. She sent me a letter. You might be interested in it. She's a hundred years old. Says: \"Dear Mr. President, at a hundred years old, you can believe I've seen it all. It's by God's grace I'm still able to be here with my family. I lived through the civil rights era. I know the blood that was shed in the name of the right to vote. I remember how hard Dr. King and many civil rights lawyers fought for the right to vote. I remember the victories they won for me and generations after me. I can assure you, Mr. President, I will keep fighting on. If I haven't stopped fighting at a hundred years old, then neither can you.\" Neither can you.\nThe authorities were trying to strike her off the voter registration rolls a few weeks ago. Somebody caught them and said, uh-uh. She got her voter registration reinstated. You can bet she's going to vote.\nIf Miss Grace Bell Hardison, a hundred years old, if she's not tired, then I'm not tired. If I'm not tired, you can't be tired. My name won't be on the ballot this time. But everything we've worked for is on the ballot. Twenty million people having health care is on the ballot. Treating the LGBT community with respect and equality is on the ballot. Good jobs and good wages is on the ballot. Early childhood education is on the ballot. Women's rights is on the ballot. Workers' rights is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot. Fairness is on the ballot. Decency is on the ballot. Our very democracy is on the ballot.\nAnd Hillary Clinton will advance these things if you give her a chance. Deborah Ross will fight for these things if you give her a chance. But you've got to go out and vote. You've got to get your friends to vote and your cousins to vote, your uncles and neighbors and coworkers to vote. Tell them, this is a moment where we take a stand. Tell them, this is a moment where our character is tested. Tell them, don't succumb to fear. Tell them to lift up hope. Tell them to choose hope. Choose hope. Carolina, choose hope. Carolina, choose what's best in us. Choose hope. Get out there and vote.\nLet's work for 4 more days. Let's win North Carolina. Let's win the Presidency for Hillary Clinton. Let's put Deborah Ross in the Senate. Let's make Roy Cooper our Governor. Let's finish what we started and remind the world why this is the greatest nation on Earth.\nGod bless you, North Carolina. God bless the United States of America.", "timestamp": "2016-11-04", "title": "Remarks at a Campaign Rally for Democratic Presidential Nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton in Charlotte, North Carolina"}

The transcript was made available by the Office of the Press Secretary on November 4, but was embargoed for release until 6 a.m. on November 5. The Office of the Press Secretary also released a Spanish language transcript of this address.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119607", "text": "Hi, everybody. Americans have been fighting for the idea that health care is a right and not a privilege since the second-to-last time the Cubs won the World Series. I'm not talking about the 2016 Cubs, I'm talking about the 1908 Cubs.\nThat's a really long time. And thanks to the efforts of so many of you, we did it. Today, 20 million more American adults know the financial security of health insurance. On top of that, another 3 million more kids have coverage than when I took office. In fact, never in American history has the uninsured rate been lower than it is right now, and health care prices have been rising slower than they have in 50 years.\nIf you haven't gotten covered yet, now is the time to do it. It's open enrollment season. That means you can go to healthcare.gov and shop for insurance plans in a marketplace where insurers compete for your business. Healthcare.gov is faster and easier to use than ever before. With a few clicks, you can start comparing plans to see which one is right for you and your family. You can even look up your doctor and medications as you shop. Most Americans who get coverage through healthcare.gov can find an option that costs less than $75 a month. That's probably less than your cell phone bill.\nNow, most of us don't get our health care through the marketplace. We get it through our job or through Medicare or Medicaid. And what you should know is that, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, your coverage is better today than it was before. You now have free preventive care. There are no more annual or lifetime limits on essential health care. Women can get free checkups, and you can't get charged more just for being a woman. Young people can stay on a parent's plan until they turn 26. Seniors get discounts on their prescriptions. And no one can be denied coverage just because of a preexisting condition.\nThat's because our goal wasn't just to make sure more people have coverage, it was to make sure more people have better coverage. And as we continue working to make the system better, there's something you can do to help yourself and help the country. Go to healthcare.gov. Get covered. And if there's someone you care about who hasn't signed up yet, help them get covered today too.\nEnrollment is open right now, but only until January 31. If you sign up by December 15, you'll be covered by the beginning of the year. So go check out healthcare.gov or call 1-800-318-2596, and someone will personally help you find a plan that's right for you.\nInsurance is based on the idea that we're all in it together. That's what makes it work. And it's the same idea that's always made America great.\nThanks, everybody, and have a good weekend.", "timestamp": "2016-11-05", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

Are you fired up? Are you ready to go?\nAudience member. I love you!\nThe President. I love you back! It is good to be back.\nCouple of people I want to thank. First of all, my favorite and, more importantly, Michelle's favorite, give it up for the great Stevie Wonder. I was going to come up and sing with Stevie, but Stevie explained that this was designed to get votes not lose votes, so we decided not to do that. [Laughter]\nI also want to thank one of the finest public servants Florida has ever known and one of the greatest Senators in the country, Bill Nelson. And I want to thank your next United States Senator, Patrick Murphy.\nTwo days, Florida. Two days to decide the future of this country. And I need you to go vote. I need your help to help finish what we started 8 years ago.\nThink about when I was—where we were when I last visited Florida, in the final days of the 2008 campaign: living through two long wars, about to enter into the worst economic crisis in 80 years. Because of you, we have been able to turn the page. We fought back. We avoided a depression. We restored the housing market. We helped to make the financial system work again. We raised income. Poverty fell. Created 15½ million new jobs. Unemployment rate 4.9 percent, near a 9-year low. Twenty million Americans have health insurance. We kicked our addiction to foreign oil, doubled our production of renewable energy. Became a world leader in climate change. Oh, and by the way, gas is 2 bucks a gallon.\nWe brought home more of our men and women in uniform. We took out Usama bin Laden. High school graduation rates, alltime high; college enrollment at an alltime high. We helped to make sure that in all 50 States, people have the freedom to marry who they love. No wonder I've got gray hair. We've been working hard.\nAnd most of all, over these last 8 years, as I've traveled all across 50 States, as I've traveled to Puerto Rico, as I've traveled all around the country, I've seen what has made America great. I have seen you, the American people.\nAudience member. Yes, you! [Laughter]\nThe President. I've got a hype man here.\nAudience member. Obama! Obama! Obama!\nThe President. I have seen Americans of every party and every faith who know that we are stronger together. Doesn't matter whether you're young or old, men or women, Black, White, Latino, Asian, Native American, folks with disabilities, gay, straight—all of us are pledging allegiance to the red, white, and blue, all of us trying to make life better for our kids and our grandkids and generations to follow. And I will tell you there's only one candidate in this race who has devoted her life to lifting up that better America, and that's the next President of the United States, Hillary Clinton. Hillary!\nAudience members. Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!\nThe President. Now, here's the thing though, Florida: All the progress we've made goes out the window if we don't win this election. And we win this election if we win Florida. If we win Florida, it's a wrap. We win Florida, it's over.\nSo we've got to work our hearts out this week, these next few days, as if our future depends on it, because our future depends on it. And I know that sometimes at the end of a campaign, there's been so much negativity and so much noise and so much distraction and so much innuendo and rumors and false statements, and at a certain point, you feel like you just want to tune it all out. Some of you all saw \"Saturday Night Live\" yesterday? They just decided that's it, we can't do it anymore. They ran outside. [Laughter] And sometimes, you feel like that.\nBut I want you to focus on this election and its candidates, because the truth is, the choice couldn't be simpler or clearer. On the one hand, you have somebody who may be the most qualified person ever to run for the Presidency. On the other hand, you've got the Donald.\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. Don't boo, vote. Don't boo, vote. Don't boo!\nAudience members. Vote!\nThe President. He can't hear your boos, but he can hear your vote.\nThere is a reason that so many Republicans, so many conservatives have denounced Donald Trump, even if sometimes they said, well, but we're going to vote for him anyway. That is because Donald Trump is uniquely unqualified to be President, temperamentally unfit to be Commander in Chief.\nLook, if you want to keep our military the greatest fighting force in the world, if you want America to be strong and respected around the world, we cannot have a Commander in Chief who suggests that it's okay to torture people or to ban entire religions from our country or insults POWs or attacks a Gold Star mom or talks down our troops.\nEven a Republican Senator said we cannot afford to give the nuclear codes to somebody so erratic. Think about that. We're talking about somebody who has the nuclear codes if they're elected President. Now, you may have heard that—this was just announced, I just read it, so I can't confirm it's true, but apparently, his campaign has taken away his Twitter. [Laughter] In the last 2 days, they had so little confidence in his self-control, they said, we're just going to take away your Twitter.\nNow, if somebody can't handle a Twitter account, they can't handle the nuclear codes. [Laughter] If somebody starts tweeting at 3 in the morning because \"SNL\" made fun of you—[laughter]—then you can't handle the nuclear codes.\nIf you believe that America is stronger when everybody does their part, and everybody pays their fair share, then you can't have the first candidate in decades who refuses to release any tax returns, who hasn't paid his Federal income tax in years, who stiffs small businesses who have done work for him, stiffs workers who have done work for him. That's not being a champion of working people. That's exploiting working people.\nIf you cherish our Constitution, you can't elect a President who threatens to shut down the free press, throws his—threatens to throw his opponents in jail, discriminates against people of different faiths. That's not what our Constitution allows. There may be other countries who do that. Maybe he admires Vladimir Putin and some other folks who think that's okay, but this is the United States of America. We can't have that.\nThe President. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nAudience members. U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nThe President. We believe in the Constitution here in the United States of America. We believe in the Bill of Rights.\nAudience member. Sí, se puede, Obama!\nThe President. Sí, se puede.\nIf you believe that we're stronger together, we cannot elect a President who vilifies minorities, who mocks Americans with disabilities, who calls immigrants criminals and rapists. We can't elect a President who brags that because he's famous, he can get away with stuff that looks like the definition of sexual assault or calls women pigs and dogs and slobs, grades them on a scale of 1 to 10.\nI've got two daughters, and they are magnificent because my wife is magnificent. And we've taught them that they can do anything a man can do and then some. And our friends who have sons have taught their sons to respect women and respect girls and judge the on the content of their character, not what they look like, and not to demean them and put them down. That's what I want whoever is in the Oval Office to do, is to help show all our girls, all our boys what it means to respect women.\nSo this election should not be a close choice. And the fact that, look, let's admit it, there are people who are supporting this other guy is an indication of the degree to which stuff that's not normal people have been treating like it's normal. I mean, we hear people justify some of this comment—some of his comments——\nAudience member. [Inaudible]\nThe President. Hold on a second.\nAudience member. Mr. President, we love you!\nThe President. I love you too, but hold on one second.\nWe hear people say that it's okay because he doesn't mean it. Or they say, well, it's just locker room talk. Or they say, well, yes, what he says is terrible, but once he gets into office, it will be different.\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. Let me tell you something. I've been in this office now almost 8 years. And here's what I can tell you. Here's what I can tell you. Who you are, what you are does not change when you take office. It just magnifies who you are. It just shines a spotlight on who you are. If you disrespect women before you became President, you'll do so once you're President. If you accept the support of Klan sympathizers before you're President, then you'll accept their support after you're President. If you disrespect the Constitution when you're running for President, then you are even more likely to disrespect it even when you swear to uphold that Constitution when you take the oath of office.\nAnd look, I am a proud Democrat. But we're not Democrats or Republicans first. We're Americans first. I've got Republican friends. They don't think or act the way he does, which is why they're not planning to vote for him. Our values are at stake.\nYou know, just a small—just a little example. I was in Fayetteville—some of you may have seen this—and it was a packed hall, and a Trump supporter stood up with a sign. He was an elderly gentleman, had a military uniform on. I couldn't really hear what he was saying. And everybody in the crowd started shouting him down and booing. And I said to everybody, you know what, just settle down. First of all, he's not doing any harm. Second of all, he's elderly. And third of all, we have free speech in this country. And I—and fourth of all, I said, don't boo, vote. [Laughter]\nJust a few hours later, Trump gets up on stage in front of his crowd—this is just a few hours later—and he said, did you see how President Obama yelled at a Trump supporter in his audience? Now, just made it up. Didn't just make it up, but said the exact opposite of what had happened. With impunity. There was tape, there was a video, and some of the press called him out on it. But the point is that he thought it was okay just to lie in front of all his supporters, on television. Wasn't even trying to be sneaky about it.\nAnd—but that says something about how unacceptable behavior has become normal. And that's why he is uniquely unqualified to hold this job. And the good news is, all of you are uniquely qualified to make sure he doesn't get the job. Florida, you've just got to vote!\nAnd the good news also is, you don't have to just vote against somebody, you got somebody to vote for. You got somebody who is worthy of your vote. Because she is smart and she is steady and she is tested—probably the most qualified person ever to run for this office—our next President, Hillary Clinton!\nAudience members. Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!\nThe President. Hillary!\nAudience members. Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!\nThe President. This is somebody who's dedicated her life to making this country better. Think about how she got her start. While Donald Trump and his developer dad were being sued by the Justice Department for denying housing to African American families, Hillary was going undercover from school to school to make sure minority kids were getting equal educations. She has not stopped fighting for justice and equality ever since.\nHer heart is in the right place, works hard every day. I know. I ran against her. [Laughter] And it was tiring because she worked so hard. I benefited from it because she came to work for me, and she was there in the room when we were making tough decisions, when we were deciding whether to go after bin Laden. She circled the globe tirelessly as Secretary of State, earned the respect of world leaders. Her efforts weren't always flashy; folks didn't always appreciate them here at home. But she made me a better President. She made this country stronger. She understands the challenges we face. And by the way, when things don't go her way, she doesn't whine, she doesn't complain, doesn't talk about things being rigged. Just works harder. Comes back stronger. Comes back better. She's like the Energizer Bunny; she just, like, keeps on going.\nShe will be an outstanding President, especially if she gets some help, which is why you got to also vote for Patrick Murphy for United States Senate. One thing about being President, you've got to have allies in Congress. Unlike his opponent Marco Rubio——\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. Don't boo. Oh, don't, oh, whoa—you're supposed to vote!\nPatrick actually shows up to work, puts you ahead of politics. He's fought to make sure Planned Parenthood is still around to provide health care to people. He's fought for comprehensive immigration reform. He accepts the science behind climate change, brought Democrats and Republicans together to fund the Everglades restoration.\nThere's one other big difference between Patrick and Marco Rubio: Marco Rubio supports Donald Trump. Now, keep in mind, Marco, a while back, when he was running against Donald, called him a \"dangerous con artist\" who \"spent his career sticking it to working people.\"\nAudience member. Hypocrite!\nThe President. He tweeted, \"friends don't let friends vote for con artists.\" [Laughter] Guess who just voted for Trump a few days ago: Marco Rubio. So, A, that means he doesn't have any good friends. [Laughter] B, it means that even though he knows Trump is unqualified, even though he knows he's a con artist, he still voted for him because it was politically expedient.\nSo if you want a Senator who will say anything, do anything, be anybody just to get elected, then that's your guy. If you want a Senator who will show up and work for you and tell you the truth, then vote for Patrick Murphy, and give Hillary some help.\nIt's not enough just to vote for Hillary. You can't stick her with a Republican Congress that behaves the way they've been behaving with me. I mean, we were about to go into a Great Depression. By the way, because there had been a Republican administration that had created a whole bunch of problems, we were coming in to clean it up. And they refused to lift a finger, said no to everything we said we would do. And now they want to take credit for, like, the auto industry being saved. No, they weren't there. [Laughter] They said, no. Run back the tape.\nInstead, what they've done is to practice unprecedented dysfunction in Washington. And they say now that they're going to do the same if Hillary wins—promising years of hearings, years of investigations, years of shutdowns, more obstruction, more repeal votes.\nMarco Rubio said he would not have supported the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, an outstanding jurist, first Latina on the bench. Proud of her Puerto Rican heritage, by all accounts doing an outstanding job. He would not have voted for her. Now he and his Republican colleagues are threatening to block all Supreme Court Justices.\nAudience member. We need a medic!\nThe President. Okay, we need a medic. They'll be all right. Don't worry, people fall down when you're standing up this long. Everybody bend their knees real quick. [Laughter] There you go. Do a little exercise. They'll be okay, just give them some room. So now they're threatening to block all nominees. And they're suggesting they might impeach Hillary. They don't know what for yet—[laughter]—but they're thinking about it. You know what? That's not how this democracy is supposed to work. If a Democrat was threatening to do that, I would say that's wrong. It's not any better when a Republican decides to do it. Gridlock is not some mysterious fog that descends on Washington. It's not both sides being equally wrong. Gridlock has been happening because you've got folks like Marco Rubio who decide to oppose anything that's good for the country if a Democrat opposes [proposes]*.\nAudience member. Your first 4 years!\nThe President. You want some more endless gridlock, vote for Republicans. You want an America that can do better, that can put people back to work, that can make sure that young people can go to college, that can provide childcare for the single mom, that will raise the minimum wage, that will make sure that we've got paid family leave—then you need to vote for Democrats up and down the ticket. You've got to vote for Hillary; you've got to vote for Patrick—people who will put you ahead of politics, who are ready to do work and move this country forward.\nSo here's the bottom line. [Applause] Here's the bottom line: There is something more fundamental at stake in this election than any policy, any plan. It's about the character of this country. Who are we? What do we stand for? What do we project around the world?\nWhen Hillary was young, her mom taught her the Methodist creed: Do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, for as long as you can. That's what she believes. That's the idea she believes she can summon from all of us in this country. That's what America is about.\nWhat makes America great—the reason people from all around the world have looked up to us and want to come here—it's not because of the size of our military. It's not because of our wealth. It's because this country was founded for the sake of an idea: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that we are endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights.\" You don't have to be born into wealth and privilege in this country to succeed. You don't have to look a certain way or have a certain last name to be able to provide for your family.\nThat's what drove patriots to fight a revolution. That's why our GIs fought fascism and communism. It's what gave women the courage to reach for the ballot, marchers to cross that bridge in Selma, workers to organize for collective bargaining and better wages. That's what makes America exceptional and great.\nIt's not about what somebody on high will do for us, it's what we do together, from the bottom up: citizens, self-governing, helping to move this country forward.\nAnd Hillary understands that. She knows our democracy is big. It's diverse. We don't demonize each other all the time. Progress requires compromise. She knows that. She knows that none of us are perfect, not even Presidents, but we should try to conduct ourselves with the basic values of decency and courtesy and dignity and respecting other people and being bighearted and knowing that if this country has given you so many breaks you should give something back; that we should look out for all kids, not just our own kids. So I know a lot of you may be cynical or fed up about politics. And this election has been a tough one. But you have the power to reject the mean-spirited politics that would take us backwards. The most important office in a democracy isn't President, it's citizen. You have the chance to make sure that this country goes in a better direction. You have the chance to elect somebody who has spent her entire life believing in this democracy.\nAudience member. We're going to miss you!\nThe President. You have the chance to elect the first female President, an example for our daughters and our sons.\nYou have the chance to shape history. Don't let that chance slip away. Don't fall for those who tell you your vote doesn't matter.\nAudience member. No!\nThe President. Don't fall for this idea that all politicians are the same. They're not. None of them are perfect, but they're not all the same. Although, some of them are a lot worse. [Laughter] Some of them are better. Some of them will look out for you. Some of you—well, I can't say what they'll do to you. [Laughter]\nSo if you've been marching for criminal justice, you've got to have a President and a Congress who actually wants to disrupt the pipeline from underfunded schools to overcrowded jails. If you've been marching for the environment, you've got to have a President and a Congress that believes in science and will protect this planet.\nIf you want more good jobs and a higher minimum wage, you can't just sit there and complain, you've got to vote. If you care about immigration reform or helping Puerto Rico get back on its feet, you've got to vote.\nYou know, over these last 8 years, a lot of things have happened, but I can tell you unequivocally, without a doubt, with data to back it up, that this country is a lot better off now than it was when I came into office. I can prove it. The numbers don't lie. And so I want you to understand that that would not have happened had it not been for the votes you made back in '08, wouldn't have happened had it not been for the votes that you made in 2012. You have proof that your vote matters. And I may not be on the ballot this time, but everything we've done has been on the ballot.\nJustice is on the ballot. Fairness is on the ballot. Looking after working people is on the ballot. Higher wages is on the ballot. Protecting the environment is on the ballot. Treating people fairly is on the ballot. Civil rights is on the ballot. Our democracy is on the ballot.\nHillary Clinton, she'll build on the progress we've made, but you have to vote. Then, you've got to get your friends voting, your cousins voting, your neighbors voting, your coworkers voting. Cousin Pookie has got to get in the—get him off the couch, he's got to vote.\nAnd when you vote, America is transformed. When you vote, we cannot lose. When you vote, we reject fear. When you vote, we embrace hope.\nChoose hope! Choose hope! Choose hope! Vote! Vote! Elect Hillary Clinton. Elect Patrick Murphy. Let's continue this amazing journey that we started and show the world why America is the greatest nation on Earth.\nI love you, Florida. Let's finish the job!", "timestamp": "2016-11-06", "title": "Remarks at a Campaign Rally for Democratic Presidential Nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton in Kissimmee, Florida"}
{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119579", "text": "Aboard Air Force One\nEn Route Ann Arbor, Michigan\n10:18 A.M. EST\nMR. EARNEST: Happy Election Eve, everybody. The President, on the day before the election, has an ambitious travel schedule today, and we're pleased that you all will be along for the ride.\nThe President is looking forward to visiting three states that he won twice when he was running for President. And he's enthusiastic about spending some time in states that don't have early vote. As you know, over the course of the last four or six weeks, the President has been taking, obviously, direction from the Clinton campaign and has focused his activities in those states where people are already voting. And today, shortly before the election, attention turns to those states that are mobilizing GOTV efforts to turn out voters on Election Day.\nAnd the President is enthusiastic about going to these states. I think two of these events today are on college campuses, and I think that should be a pretty good indication to you the President is looking forward to making the case to young voters about why they should be engaged in this race, why they should be casting a vote on Election Day, and why he believes they should be supporting the candidate that's looking to build on the progress that we've made over the last eight years.\nSo you all will hear from the President. I wouldn't expect a speech that's markedly different than what you've heard before. But in Philadelphia, he'll be doing something a little bit different than what he's done before because he will be introducing Secretary Clinton, and it will be the last speech that he'll give before Election Day. And he'll be doing it from a historic place. This is the site where our Founding Fathers, 240 years ago, signed the Declaration of Independence. And I think that this symbolic nature of this evening's event I think will be powerful.\nOver the next 48 hours, the American people will be taking part in our democracy, where the greatest country in the world decides who its leader will be, based on the preferences of the people. And that's a rather profound thing. And when you consider how we've been sort of focused on polling numbers and charges and counter-charges between the campaigns, there's something profound about the citizens of the greatest country in the world coming together to decide who is going to lead them for the next four years.\nThat's a weighty decision, but our process for that peaceful transition of power is an important part of what makes America the greatest country on Earth. And that's the exercise that we'll all be observing and participating in over the next 48 hours. And the President is looking forward at this impactful moment to having an opportunity to make a forceful case in support of Secretary Clinton.\nSo with that, I'm ready to take your questions.\nQ: Josh, yesterday Director Comey issued a letter to Congress saying that the FBI --\nMR. EARNEST: I saw that.\nQ: I'm sure you did. What's the White House reaction to that? And more generally, what is your reaction to the fact that he did this at all?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Jeff, the thing I can -- one week ago today, we stood in the White House Briefing Room -- you all sat in the White House Briefing Room, and we had a protracted back- and-forth about the White House's view of Director Comey's decision to send a letter to Congress updating them on the status of their review of some emails potentially related to Secretary Clinton's server. At that point, I indicated that I was neither prepared to defend, nor criticize Director Comey's decision to communicate to Congress about that position. And standing here today aboard Air Force One, I'm not prepared to defend, nor criticize Director Comey's position to send another letter updating Congress further on the status of that work.\nThe White House has not been briefed on this investigation over the course of the last year and a half, and we've not been updated -- we've not been briefed on that investigation over the course of the last week and a half, either. This is an investigation that's being conducted by the FBI and the Department of Justice. And the White House has gone to great lengths to avoid even the appearance of political interference in that ongoing investigation.\nSo the White House was not informed in advance of Director Comey's decision to send the letter yesterday. And the President believes that those decisions are best left to professionals at the FBI and the Department of Justice, who have a responsibility to set aside their own personal political views and focus on the facts of the investigation, follow where the evidence leads, and ensure that we have a criminal justice system, an investigative process that's insulated from politics, that's focused on the rule of law. And the President believes that our democracy is best served when investigators demonstrate a commitment to that principle.\nQ: Do you acknowledge that the FBI Director's actions have affected the campaign, even if that's not what the intent was?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think I would acknowledge that much of the debate in the campaign over the last 10 days has been concentrated around Director Comey's decision. I think that is an objective fact for anybody that's been watching television or reading the newspaper or checking Twitter.\nWhat impact it actually has in the polling place I think is something that we'll have greater insight to on -- about 36 hours from now. But even then, I'm confident that there were will be a lot of post-election analysis trying to discern what kind of impact and how much of an impact it actually had. And that's something for academics and political analysts to focus on.\nRight now, the President will be making the case, and over the course of today the President will be making the case, that there's a lot at stake in this election. And that when you consider the impact on the economy, the impact on our national security, the impact on our ability to look out for middle-class families -- all that's at stake in this election, too.\nQ: Does the President continue to have confidence in Director Comey?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I indicated last Monday, when asked about Director Comey in the briefing, that the President views Director Comey as a man of integrity, a man of principle. There's a reason that President Bush chose him to serve in a senior position at the Department of Justice. There's a reason that a strong majority of Democrats and Republicans in the United States Senate confirmed him to be the Director of the FBI after he was nominated by President Obama. And the President's views on him have not changed and, yes, he continues to have confidence in his ability to run the FBI.\nQ: One of the arguments from Donald Trump has been that it's not logistically feasible for the FBI to have gone through 650,000 emails in just over eight days, and that, therefore, they didn't actually look into this. Is the White House confident that the investigation was carried out diligently?\nMR. EARNEST: Josh, I have not been briefed on the investigation, so for how exactly the FBI went about doing the work that they said that they were going to do, beginning last -- a week ago Friday, is something that you should talk about with them.\nAs I indicated last week, the President is entirely confident that Director Comey is not using his authority to advantage a particular political candidate or a particular political party. But for greater insight into how the FBI and the Department of Justice did the work they said that they were going to do and said that they have now completed, you should go talk to them.\nQ: The final day of the campaign, waged very viciously or hard, can I think bring about different emotions. And we saw, like, four years ago, for example, President Obama teared up in Iowa in the final campaign stop. Could you give us some color about sort of the President's mindset, what he's feeling right now, personally? I mean, this is sort of the final day before we may have a President-elect that would replace him. And also, maybe your own personal reflections.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I did speak to the President a little bit earlier today, both on the helicopter and on the plane. I think my comments earlier about the profound nature of this grand experiment that we call democracy is something that is on the President's mind today. It's a remarkable thing that the greatest country in the world, the most powerful country in the world, chooses its leadership not through force, but through a fair election in which the citizens have an opportunity to express their preference. And there's a commitment on the part of the person who is serving in power to ensure a smooth transition to the next person, regardless of whether or not he supported the previous candidate.\nI think the other thing that's on the President's mind is there's also an opportunity for our country to make some history. There's an opportunity for the American people to decide to elect a woman as President of the United States, and for the first time in the 240-year history of our country. That's a powerful thing, too.\nI think President Obama is well aware of the stakes of this election. He's dedicated that last decade of his life to fighting for and advancing an agenda that tries to make our country more fair and more just, and expands opportunities for middle-class families and those families that are working really hard to try to get to the middle class. He poured his heart and soul into trying to advance our interests around the globe and to making the United States of America and the people of the United States safer.\nAnd he's proud of the progress that we've made. That progress would not have been possible without investment and involvement of the American people, and he recognizes that that progress will not continue unless the American people send a clear signal that it should. And that certainly is an important part of this election too.\nI think the other thing that -- in terms of my own view, the election of the next President is the clearest tangible sign that this presidency is about to end. And having served with President Obama since his first day in the White House, it's a moment for reflection.\nAnd today's a day to savor, I think, in a lot of ways. If you haven't noticed yet, you'll notice over the course of today that there are a number of members of the President's senior staff who are traveling today, and I think all of them have the same recognition, which is that this has been an extraordinary blessing to have an opportunity to serve this President and to serve this country, and to try to fight for things that we all believe deeply in too.\nSo I think I'm not the only one that's feeling a deep sense of gratitude for the kind of opportunities that I've had over the last eight years. That doesn't mean that every day has been easy. It doesn't mean that every day has been fun. But this has been the opportunity of a lifetime.\nAnd this is the kind of opportunity that most people don't have. And so I feel incredibly blessed to have had the good fortune to see so much history up close and to be associated with a group of people who are committed to the public interest and fighting for a set of values that were instilled in me at an early age in terms of the fairness and justice and equality.\nAnd so that certainly is on my mind through the course of today.\nQ: -- strong emotions. I wonder if the President has talked or delivered any personal message to you all today, for the staff or is he making calls to other alumni, by any chance? And then also if you could also foreshadow at all what his schedule is like tomorrow, where he'll be watching the election. And I know on Election Day, the team has often had rituals such as playing basketball and so on. Does the President have any of those rituals he's going to do tomorrow as well?\nMR. EARNEST: In terms of the President's time today, he's very focused on the upcoming election. And he's going to be 100 percent focused on making a strong public case for Secretary Clinton and ensuring that people understand the stakes of this election. And there will be time for him to think and talk a little bit more about his own presidency and his own perspective on the last eight years in the two months or so that remain in his presidency. There will be plenty of time for that.\nI don't have much of an update on his schedule tomorrow. We'll keep you posted on that. The President does have some Election Day traditions, and we'll certainly do our best to keep you posted on how those are observed.\nQ: Tens of millions of people have already voted. The President said last week or a couple of weeks ago that he follows the returns and he was tracking the African American vote, and said that it hadn't been where he expected it to be. Now that early voting is basically done, how does he feel about the electorate so far? Is he more confident today than he was back then?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the President continues to feel optimistic about the trajectory of the race, and that is based on publicly available data; that is based on the data that he has access to in terms of the composition of the early vote. And it also is consistent with his sense of things on the ground. He's spent a lot of time on the road over the last week and he senses the kind of energy among Secretary Clinton's supporters that leaves him feeling optimistic about the trajectory of the race.\nBut I think the aggressive schedule that he has assembled for today I think is an indication that he's not taking a single vote for granted. He is fighting complacency. And given the stakes of the election, he's counting on Secretary Clinton's supporters to do the same thing. He's also counting on his supporters to do the same thing. He's urging people not to give in to the temptation to not be as focused on this election just because he's not on the ballot.\nAs you've heard him say many times, his agenda, his legacy is on the ballot. And so much of the work that he is proud of accomplishing over the last eight years would not have been possible without the American people mobilizing to make it happen, and he's counting on the American people to mobilize once again on Election Day to ensure that that work and that progress can continue.\nQ: The Kurdish-led forces in Syria started the operation over the weekend to try to retake Raqqa. We now have that very challenging operation going on at the same time as another very challenging operation in Mosul. Could you give us an update on what kind of progress the U.S. is seeing in both of those battles?\nMR. EARNEST: Josh, for a detailed operational assessment, I'd refer you to my colleagues at the Department of Defense, but I got a very top line briefing this morning. As you've obviously seen from the Syrian Democratic forces and from Secretary Carter, the Syrian forces on the ground inside of Syria that we are supporting have begun the operation against Raqqa.\nThe first step in that process is isolating Raqqa. And we're obviously pleased to see this coalition of forces that includes Arabs and Kurds and Turkmen fighters beginning to focus on what's necessary to retake the city in Syria that ISIL has designated as their capital. This is important to successfully destroying the myth of a caliphate that ISIL has tried to propagate.\nAnd the work that the Syrian Democratic forces are doing on the ground obviously will benefit from the kind of air campaign that the United States and our coalition partners can wage to advance their efforts. Those Syrian Democratic forces also benefit from the equipment that the United States and our coalition partners have provided them.\nAt the same time, we anticipate that this will be a long campaign and not one that is easily won. ISIL has dug into Raqqa for more than two years, and we anticipate that ISIL fighters will expend great effort to defend the city that they have designated as their capital.\nWith regard to Mosul, I can tell you that Iraqi security forces continue to make progress. The progress there is slow, but it's steady. They benefit from the advice and assistance of U.S. and other coalition forces on the ground. They also benefit from the military airpower that our coalition can bring to bear to make them more effective on the ground.\nAnd the President is getting regular updates on the situation. And obviously all of this is an indication of the progress that our counter-ISIL coalition is making to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\nQ: Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized the President for spending so much time on the campaign trail, saying that he should be focusing on ISIS and jobs. Can you give us a sense of how the President is balancing his official duties with his pretty heavy campaign schedule?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Toluse, you've heard me observe on a number of occasions that any successful President must be able to demonstrate an ability to handle more than one priority at a time. And the progress that our coalition is making against ISIL in Iraq and in Syria continues unabated -- unabated by the campaign, I should say -- they are obviously countering resistance on the ground. But they are continuing to make progress. And the Commander-in-Chief and everybody else in the chain of command has not been distracted one bit by the campaign -- by the political campaign in the United States. Our fight against ISIL is critical to our national security and is prioritized for that reason.\nI think last Friday's jobs report is an indication that the President and his economic team continue to be focused on the kinds of policies that support and have supported the longest streak of job growth in our nation's history.\nAnd the truth of the matter is, though, Tuluse, is that the outcome of the election will have an impact on our national security and will have an impact on our continued economic strength. After all, you have one candidate who's vowing to undermine the kinds of policies that have contributed so greatly to our economic recovery, and a political candidate who's vowing to not just ignore but roll back the recommended steps that are advised by our nation's military leaders.\nThese are the steps that have allowed us to increase the pressure on ISIL, to take back more than 50 percent of the territory that ISIL previously controlled in Iraq and a large portion of the territory that ISIL previously controlled in Syria.\nIn northern Syria, there now is an area about the size of New Jersey where opposition forces have succeeded in driving ISIL out, where ISIL no longer poses a direct, imminent threat to those areas. That's reflects important progress, and that progress is possible because of the good advice the President is getting from his military leaders.\nIgnoring that advice, rolling it back would not be good for our national security, would not be good for our counter-ISIL campaign, and certainly would not be good for our relationships with the 60-some-odd countries that are contributing to the counter-ISIL campaign.\nSo it's important for people to understand that the kinds of priorities that the President is focused on every day are not disconnected from the outcome of tomorrow's election.\nQ: The President and Secretary Clinton will presumably have a chance to speak before or after their event today in Philly. Do you know when the last time they spoke was and where the last time they were able to meet face to face?\nMR. EARNEST: Off the top of my head, I don't know the last time they met face to face. I suspect it might have been at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute dinner about six weeks ago in Washington. They both spoke at that event. I believe they were there at the same time and saw each other backstage. I can't recall another time when they were in the same place at the same time.\nQ: -- over the phone or over email over the course of the campaign?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any additional phone calls to tell you about. But obviously, Secretary Clinton has been quite busy on the campaign trail. But I don't have any additional calls to tell you about.\nQ: Just for clarification. You said earlier that some of the senior staff is traveling with the President today on the final campaign swing. We saw some get on the plane earlier. Are some joining later in the trip, to arrive with the President?\nMR. EARNEST: I was noting that there are a number of senior officials that are on the plane today.\nAll right? Thanks, everybody. We'll see you on the ground.\nEND 10:41 A.M.

{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "note": "Remarks as delivered.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119690", "text": "Hello Grand Valley! Thank you! Thank you.\nIt is great to be back in western Michigan. Thank you. Are there any Lakers here?\nOh, my gosh. I am so thrilled to be here. I want to thank the president of this great university, Tom Haas, the faculty, the staff, the students. I want to thank Brandon Dillon, the Chair of the Michigan Democratic Party. And I especially really want to thank you for sending Debbie Stabenow to the United States Senate.\nI have also the great personal experience and privilege of having worked with Debbie, gotten to know her, become a friend of hers, and I am so excited at the possibility that I'll be able to work with her again. But I want you to know this - and I really, really hope you'll tell folks, because there is no more dedicated, effective member of the United States Senate than Debbie Stabenow.\nShe fights for all of you every day, but she does it with that smile that never leaves her face. And she brings people together who are on opposite sides of issues because she just keeps talking. And don't we need more of that in Washington where people actually talk and listen to each other. So it's wonderful to be with all of you and to be introduced by Debbie.\nAre you ready to vote tomorrow, Michigan? Are you ready to help get your friends to vote tomorrow? That is clearly the right answer because we have a really important election tomorrow.\nThe choice in this election could not be clearer. And I know that for many people, you've gone back and forth, you've thought about what to do, and I really respect that. But let me say this. Let me say this. This election is basically between division and unity in our country.\nIt's between strong and steady leadership or a loose cannon who could put everything at risk. It is between an economy that works for everyone or one that is even more stacked for those at the top. And I want each and every one of you to be thinking through about all the issues that you care about. Because although my name and my opponents name will be on the ballot, those issues, and those values, are on the ballot as well.\nAnd as you think about what you care about and what you want your future to look like you have to recognize this is a consequential election. I have been privileged to know a lot of our presidents over the past decades, and people who ran for president. I was privileged to know as a college student, Gerald Ford.\nIn fact, I had an internship with the House Republican Conference Committee, which he headed, after my junior year in college. So when I say I've gotten to know a lot of our presidents, and people who've run for president, it goes back a ways. And here's what I want you to understand. I didn't agree with everything they did or said. Even the Democrats. We had differences and politics and policies and sometimes on principle, but I never doubted, I never doubted that they were fit to serve as our president and commander-in-chief.\nThat's why this election is so different. And it's why so many Republicans have spoken out to endorse me and support me, and who have taken very courageous stands against the nominee of their own party. Because they believe that we must put country ahead of party when it comes to this election.\nI was at Kent State, in Ohio, last week and I was introduced by a gentleman by the name of Bruce Blair. And Mr. Blair had served in the Air Force, he was a young officer assigned to be what was called a launch officer. That meant he served his time every day sitting in a bunker where the controls for launching nuclear weapons were housed. And his job - imagine the responsibility. A young Air Force officer in his twenties, waiting to hear whether or not an order is given for him to launch nuclear weapons.\nAnd Bruce Blair explained that there is no appeal from a president's order to do that. The joint chiefs of our military forces can't say, \"No, don't do it.\" There's no veto from Congress or anyone else. And the time between the order being given and the actual launch is four minutes.\nSo after watching this election Mr. Blair began contacting others who had served in this incredibly responsible position to share his concerns about what he was hearing and seeing. And several dozen of them - I'd never met them before - several dozen of them wrote a letter explaining why they could never support Donald Trump to be our commander-in-chief.\nThe awesome responsibility that is housed in one person is something I want you to think about between now and the time you vote. Because I will pledge to you that I will exercise the greatest care and responsibility in all of the powers invested in the office of the presidency.\nI also want to pose to you a contrast in visions. Did any of you see the debates? First of all, I did stand for four and a half hours with Donald Trump on the stage, proving conclusively I have the stamina to be president.\nBut I have to say, in addition to that, there were so many things that he said that of course I sometimes was surprised by. But the theme that ran through much of his rhetoric was the presentation of a dark and divisive vision for America. Now I have to tell you, I know we've got problems. I've spent 18 months traveling around our country talking to - by now - hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people, hearing what's on people's minds. We've got challenges but America's always had challenges. And since when do we become pessimistic and not able to think about what we can do to overcome those challenges and solve those problems together?\nI often didn't recognize the country that Donald Trump was describing. Because from my perspective, looking back at our history, we have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us. And you can vote for a hopeful, inclusive, big-hearted America that will set the stage for an even better future.\nAnd I want to say especially to the students who are here - I really believe that America's best days are still ahead of us if we reach for them together.\nMake no mistake. Our core values are being tested in this election. But my faith in our future has never been stronger. Last night in Manchester, New Hampshire, I was introduced by Mr. Khizr Khan.\nSome of you know or remember that his son, Captain Khan, serving in the United States Army, was killed serving in Iraq. And like at the Democratic Convention this summer, he spoke powerfully about what America means to him. And how we have to defend our values and our Constitution that are the envy of the rest of the world. People look at us with yearning. They see that we are a beacon of freedom, hope and opportunity for people, right here, at home.\nWhen I heard Mr. Khan speak at the convention, and I heard him again last night, I was so touched because what he said exhibited a love of our country. He said that when he started hearing Donald Trump speak, and all of the things he said about so many people, not only Muslims but African-Americans and Latinos and POWs and women and so many people - when he heard it he couldn't help but think as he walked around his house - he has a room where his son's medals - he got the Bronze Star, he got the Purple Heart - the flag that was draped on his coffin - is respectfully presented in the box that he was given it in. And he thought to himself, \"Would there be any room for my son in Donald Trump's America?\"\nThink about that for a minute. Because every single one of us has something to contribute. To this great country. We are already great but we can be greater. And we will be greater.\nI love our country and I believe in the American people, and I know there is nothing we can't do when we make up our minds. Throughout our history, generations of Americans have risen together to meet the tests of their time. They defended democracy. They built the greatest middle class the world has ever known. They marched for civil rights and voting rights, for workers' rights and union rights, for LGBT rights, rights for people with disabilities.\nAnd now, now we've got to come together and we have to prove we can meet the chal-lenges of our time. We've got to get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top.\nIf you believe, as I do, that America thrives when the middle class thrives, then you have to vote tomorrow.\nWe are going to make the biggest investment in good paying jobs since World War II. Jobs in infrastructure. Our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports, our water systems.\nThese are jobs we need doing in American and these are jobs that cannot be exported. They've got to be done right here in Michigan and across our country.\nAnd we are going to invest in new jobs in advanced manufacturing. I am not one of these folks who think, \"We just can't make it in America anymore.\" And I'll tell you why. Because if we have a plan and we actually commit to fulfilling that plan, we can lead the world in precision machining, in 3-D printing. We're not competing for low-wage jobs, we're competing with Germany for high manufacturing, high- skilled jobs.\nAnd we are going to have clean, renewable energy jobs as a way to fight climate change. As you heard, my opponent chose to make many of his products overseas. And as I pointed out in the last debate, he buys cheap Chinese steel and aluminum instead of good American steel, made by American steel workers.\nHe's gone all over this country, and he's gone all over Michigan, talking about how he's gonna really get more jobs and he's going to bring back what used to be there. Well I'll tell you what. Look at his record, don't just listen to his rhetoric.\nBecause I have a different idea. We're going to invest in America again. And for every-body who is frustrated, and anxious, and maybe even angry because they feel left out, left behind, that America's not working the way it should - I understand that. I under-stand that. I represented upstate New York for eight years, and I saw first hand a lot of the loss of jobs and factories, picking up and moving out.\nBut I also realized that anger is not a plan. You've got to come together and figure out what is it we're gonna do to bring new jobs back and create more opportunity for people.\nAnd I'll just tell you that I believe that we've got to defend the American worker's right to organize and bargain for better wages and benefits.\nWe're gonna get incomes rising here in western Michigan and across this state. And we're also gonna do more to help small business. My dad was a small businessman. He worked really hard. He ran a printing plant that printed fabrics for draperies, and I would from time to time help him out. You take a silkscreen, you put it down on the long table, you pour the paint in, you do the squeegee, you pick it up - it wasn't automated, we were the automaters - and you'd go all the way down to one table, you'd go to the other table. So I know how hard people in small business work.\nAnd I also know something else. Donald Trump made a lot of money off the backs of small business people and contractors by stiffing them and refusing to pay his bills. And I have said, \"I am sure glad my dad never got a contract from Donald Trump, because we could not have afforded that.\"\nBut it's not just enough to grow the economy. We have to make it fairer. And if you believe we need a fairer economy then you have to vote. I think the best antidote for whatever ails a person is a good job. I believe in hard work. That's how I was raised. But I also believe that if you work hard and you work full time you shouldn't still be in poverty at the end of the year. And I'm gonna raise the national minimum wage.\nAnd one of the things I've heard all over America, especially from young families, really from all families but particularly young families, is how hard it is to do so many of the things that are expected - like where do you find affordable quality childcare? In lots of states, it's more expensive than college tuition. We're gonna get the cost of childcare down. We're going to have a paid family leave program so that when you have a sick relative or you're sick you won't lose your job.\nI saw the folks over there holding up the Tim Kaine sign and I really appreciate that. Thank you. Thank you. I got to tell you - Tim and I were in Pittsburgh last month, with a big crowd, and we couldn't get everybody in, like today, so Tim went out to say hello to people and he saw a woman holding a baby, probably about three years old. And he stopped to talk to her and she said, \"I came here because I wanted to tell you, and to tell Hillary Clinton, what happened to me.\" She said that, \"I had my baby, it was a hard labor and delivery and I needed some time off. And I called by boss and said the doctors want me to take some time off and so I won't be in for - I think she said two weeks - and they said, \"OK. You're fired.\"\nThat is legal in America, still. And what that does is to say that - wait a minute, do we really value children? Do we really value families? And we've got to have a system that is fair to employers and fair to employees because you got to be able to balance work and family in today's America.\nAnd then finally, I think it is way past time to guarantee equal pay for women's work.\nAnd you know I gotta say - this always gets a huge round of applause, as you can tell - but this is not just a woman's issue. It's a family issue. If you have a wife, a mother, a sister, a daughter, who's in the work force, you want her to be paid what she deserves to be paid to help you and your family.\nJust about everything I've said so far my opponent disagrees with. And whenever I talk about affordable childcare, and paid family leave, and equal pay - he says I'm playing the woman's card and you know what I say, if that's the case? Then deal me in.\nAnd here's what else I want you to know. It's fair to ask, \"How are you going to pay for that?\" That's not only fair, that's necessary to ask. Because I want to be a good steward of your tax dollars just as I expect you're a good steward of your family budget. I have proposed a very simple formula. I will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000 a year.\nAnd for small businesses, we're gonna cut your taxes because I know a lot of small businesses need that kind of tax relief. So instead, we're going where the money is, to the millionaires and the billionaires and the big corporations.\nAnd that is in stark contrast to what Donald Trump has proposed. His whole economic plan is cut trillions of dollars in taxes from millionaires and billionaires and corporations. That is trickle-down economics on steroids. I profoundly disagree. I think the way you build an economy is from the middle out and the bottom up, not from the top down.\nWhen you think about it, Donald hasn't paid anything for 20 years. He's paid zero to support our military, our vets, Pell grants for students here at Grand Valley, our high-ways - and I am still pondering, I am just pondering how anybody can lose a billion dollars in one year.\nEspecially when you're running casinos. I do not understand that. But that will be one of the mysteries in this campaign because he's not going to release his tax returns now and the time you start voting. And that sort of suggests there must be something really terrible in those tax returns because everybody else for more than 40 years has released them.\nSo, we'll still wonder. But what we know is his economic approach will cost us jobs, not create jobs. And we can't afford that. We need to keep building. We have recovered from the worst financial crash since the Great Depression but we're not where we need to be yet. The last thing we need is a failed economic policy coming back in and pushing us back down. And depriving people of the jobs that we want to create.\nAnd if you believe all of our kids should have good schools and good teachers no matter what zip code they live in then you have to vote.\nAnd if you believe college should be affordable you have to vote. I've got to say I am proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran. It was a campaign about ideas and issues, not insults. And when it was over, we actually got together. What a novel idea. We wanted to figure out how we can work together to actually produce on some of the goals that we both shared. So Bernie and I worked on this plan together.\nPublic colleges and universities should be tuition-free for everyone who makes less than a $125,000 a year. And they should be debt-free for everyone else because nobody should go into debt. And if you have gone into debt, if you're among the millions of Americans who are struggling - as I see some hands pointing in the air - paying back your student debt, we are going to help you pay it down and pay it off.\nIt makes no sense at all. We have interest rates that are really low right now. Buy a car for what, 1 or 2 percent. You can buy a house for 3,4 percent. There are so many people who are paying 8, 10, 12, higher - 8, 10, 12 percent interest - how much? Twelve point seven. Fourteen point one. I got to tell you friends. That is outrageous. The federal government should not be making money off of sending kids to college.\nI can't wait to roll up my sleeves with Debbie and Bernie and we're gonna get to work right after this election if I am fortunate enough to win.\nLook. Working for children and families has been the cause of my life, but it's never been more important than it is right now. And that has to be our mission together. Doing all we can to help every American, and especially every young American and every child in America to have the chance to live up to their God-given potential. I will wake up every single day in the White House trying to figure out what I can do to make that a reality for you.\nSo after tomorrow the work will begin, and one of the highest priorities that I feel an obligation to address is how we bring our country together. A lot of people say we've got to heal our country, or as the Bible says repair the breach. Because we have so much divisiveness right now. We've got to start listening to each other. Respecting each other. I know it is unusual, I admit, for somebody running for president, especially the day before an election, but I've been saying this for months. To say that we need more of two things right now.\nWe need more love and kindness in America.\nI don't know about you, I don't know about you but I bet everyone of us has received a kindness and maybe, I hope, we've all extended one. I am standing here today because my mother, who was abandoned by her parents, rejected by her grandparents, went to work at the age of 14 as a maid, and a babysitter, was extended kindness. Not by those who should have loved her, but by others. The first grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch, who began bringing extra food. The woman whose house she went to work in who knew that my mother wanted to go to high school. She would have been a freshman in high school when she had to leave her grandparents' home and she got this job. And that woman said, \"I know you want to go to high school. If you get up early and you get your chores done, you can go to high school, but you'll have to come back because we'll need you in the late afternoon.\"\nNow that may sound harsh to say to a 14-year old but to my mother it was a gift. I tell you this because we all have to start thinking about how we want to be treated and what that means about how we treat others. And …\nThere's a version of the golden rule in every major religion. And it is a reminder that every one of us gets knocked down. The question as my mother would say is are you gonna get back up? And for people in our country who feel like they've been knocked down and nobody cares, nobody's paying attention, here's what I want you to know. If you give me the honor of being your president I'm gonna do everything I can to get this country and everybody in it back up on our feet moving forward together.\nBecause I want to be a president for all Americans.\nDemocrats, Republicans, Independents. Not just the people who support me, everybody in this country. Because I believe with all my heart each of us has a role to play in building a better future. So let's take that first step tomorrow. If you don't know where you're supposed to vote go to iwillvote.com - you can get all the information you need. If you want to help us bringing out the vote here in western Michigan in the last 24, 36 hours, you can still sign up to volunteer. Go to hillaryclinton.com. Or you can text join247246 or stop by one of our offices. We would be really excited to see you, because when your kids and grandkids ask what you did in 2016, when everything was on the line, I hope you'll be able to say that you voted for a better, stronger, fairer America.\nAn America where we build bridges, not walls.And an America where we prove that yes, love trumps hate.\nThank you all so much.", "timestamp": "2016-11-07", "title": "Remarks at Grand Valley State University in Grand Rapids, Michigan"}

Whoa! Thank you! Thank you. Well, I got to tell you, this is sure worth staying up for. It is so great to be here in Raleigh, here at North Carolina State University. And I cannot imagine a better way of ending this campaign than having the opportunity to see all of you and to watch and listen to Lady Gaga. One of the most inventive, creative and passionate performers, whose range goes from A to Z and beyond. And I was watching on the screen not only her perform, but all of you jumping and singing and waving. It was great!\nBecause, you know what? That's what I want for America and the young people of America: the joy, the passion, the intensity! And our longtime friend, Jon Bon Jovi, was with us. He was with us up in Philadelphia, where he and Bruce Springsteen sang. And Jon said, 'Well, hey, I want to go down to Raleigh,' and so here he is! And between now and the time the poll closes tomorrow, we are going to be living on a prayer.\nI was really impressed when everybody's hand went up saying you'd already voted. Well, go find somebody else who hasn't voted, okay? Bring out your friends, your roommates, strangers on the street. Just stop and talk to them about what's at stake in this election. Because North Carolina is key, and it's not only important for our election. Are you ready to elect Roy Cooper as your next governor? Well, I sure hope so. I sure hope so, and I hope you're ready to elect Linda Coleman your lieutenant governor. And how about Dan Blue, III, for state treasurer? And I really, really hope you will send Deborah Ross to Washington!\nNow, we are all fired up. When we were with the President and Michelle in Philadelphia. You know, the President was talking about how absolutely consequential this election is, and of course it is. I really believe it's the most important election of our lifetimes because we've never had a clearer choice. Never. It is a choice between division or unity; between strong, steady leadership or a loose cannon who could risk everything. It's a choice between an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. And it is a choice that really goes to the heart of who we are as Americans.\nWhat I saw before I came in and what I see now is a sense of potential, of joy. There is no reason, my friends, why America's best days are not ahead of us if we reach for them together. We don't have to accept a dark and divisive vision for America. Tomorrow you can vote for a hopeful, inclusive, big-hearted America.\nOur core values – our core values are being tested in this election, but my faith in our future has never been stronger. I love our country and I believe in the American people. And I know if we bring everyone together, we can set goals and we can move toward them and we can feel that sense of accomplishment that comes with being part of something bigger than ourselves.\nYou know, one of the great privileges of crisscrossing the country, as I have in this campaign, is meeting remarkable people – people who stand up against the odds; people who, like my late mother, people who understand that everybody gets knocked down. What matters is whether you get back up, whether you believe you can keep going.\nLast night, in Manchester, New Hampshire, I had the honor of being introduced by an extraordinary man, Khizr Khan, whose son, Captain Khan, was killed serving our country in Iraq. You may remember Mr. Khan's speech at the Democratic Convention. And again last night, he reminded us of the responsibility we all share to protect and defend our Constitution. The story of Captain Khan is one of courage in the face of danger. He was with his unit when he saw a suspicious vehicle. He told his men to stay back. He moved toward the vehicle to check it out. And the bomb went off. He lost his life, but everyone else in his unit survived. He was awarded the Bronze Star. And this intensely personal tragedy that the Khan family experienced, becoming a Gold Star family, was one that they thought about, grieved over in the privacy of their home, until they heard my opponent start talking about who was acceptable in America and who wasn't. The categories of people, starting with immigrants, including African Americans and Latinos and POWs and Muslims. The list went on and on. And it created in Mr. Khan a sense of despair because he asked himself, would his son have a place in Donald Trump's America? Someone who paid the ultimate price in serving our country.\nWell, we can answer that question tomorrow resoundingly: Yes. Absolutely.\nThink about – think about how generations of Americans throughout our history have come together to meet the tests of their time. Our parents, our grandparents, our great-grandparents defended democracy. They built the great American middle class. They marched for civil rights and voting rights, for workers' rights, and women's rights, for LGBT rights, and the rights of people with disabilities. And tomorrow we face the test of our time.\nSo, remember, it's not just my name or Donald Trump's name on the ballot. It's the kind of country we want. It's every issue anyone cares about. So if you believe America thrives when the middle class thrives, then you have to vote tomorrow. If you believe we should make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II in infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, clean energy, small business, then you have to vote. If you believe we need more fairness in our economy to raise the minimum wage because no one who works full-time should still be in poverty, then you have to vote. If you believe we need to do more to support working families with affordable childcare, paid leave, and equal pay for women, then you have to vote. And, remember, when my opponent says every time I talk about these issues that I'm playing the woman's card, well, you know what I say. Deal me in. And if you believe, if you believe, all kids deserve good schools with good teachers, no matter what house they live in, you have to vote. And if you believe college should be more affordable, you have to vote. Bernie Sanders and I worked on a plan to make public colleges and universities tuition-free if you earn less than $125,000 and debt-free for everybody else. And for the millions of Americans struggling with student debt, we are going to help you pay that down and pay that off. If you believe in science and that we've got to address climate change, you have to vote. If you believe we need to reform our criminal justice system so everyone is treated fairly, then you have to vote. And if you believe – if you believe we should never write discrimination into our laws, well, then you know, you know, North Carolina. You've got to vote to get rid of HB2!\nNow, this is so energizing, we could keep going with a long list. But here's what – here's what else I want you to know. A good thing this election didn't land during exams, that's all I can say. Look. Tomorrow – tomorrow night, this election will end. But I want you to understand, our work together will be just beginning. We have to bridge the divides in this country. As the Bible says, we have to repair the breaches. We've got to be willing to start listening to each other again, respecting each other again. And I want to thank Gaga because she has always stood for that fundamental principle of respecting everybody.\nSo I want you to know and I want you to spread the word. I do want to be President for all Americans, not just some, not just the people who support me and vote for me. I want to be President for everyone because we all have a role to play in building that better future for our country and for each of you.\nSo if you haven't voted yesterday, go to iwillvote.com. You can get all the info you need. And you can still sign up to volunteer. Right? Go to hillaryclinton.com or text 'join,' j-o-i-n, to 47246, or stop by one of our offices. We would welcome you to help make sure everybody gets out to vote tomorrow because none of us want to wake up Wednesday morning and wish we had done more. Right?\nAnd years from today, when your kids and grandkids ask what you did in 2016 when everything was on the line, you'll be able to say you voted for a stronger, fairer, better America, an America where we build bridges, not walls, and where we prove conclusively that yes, love trumps hate! Thank you! Let's go vote, North Carolina! God bless you! Thank you all very much!", "timestamp": "2016-11-07", "title": "Remarks at North Carolina State University in Raleigh"}
{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "note": "Remarks as delivered.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119698", "text": "Hello, Pittsburgh! Woah! Hello back there!\nThank you, thank you. Wow! It's great to be here at this extraordinary time in our country's history at this great university to have a chance on a beautiful day to lift our sights, to think about what we are capable of doing together. The kind of future that we can create if we search for and find common ground. And it is thrilling to have traveled across our country to see the hopefulness, to talk about the positive changes that are occurring.\nTo really see America at its best, and tomorrow, each and every one of you gets to make a decision as to whether or not, first, you will vote. Because in Pennsylvania, it's all about Election Day. Other places around the country have been voting for weeks. And what you will vote for.\nI'm here to ask you to vote for yourselves, vote for your families, vote for your futures, vote on the issues that matter to you because they are on the ballot, not just my name and my opponent's name. I want to thank Tom Colicchio for coming out here. He's in the middle of opening another one of his great restaurants, but he said he's got these two small kids and he just had to come and be part of lifting up this election and creating the kind of commitment that will bring a record breaking number of Americans to vote. We are on the path to seeing more Americans coming out to vote than we have ever seen in our history.\nAnd I am hoping that you won't just come out to vote, obviously, I hope you vote for me, but I also hope you will send Katie McGinty to the United States Senate. We've got some great elected officials here, and I want to recognize Congressman Mike Doyle, County Executive Rich Fitzgerald, from Pittsburgh, Mayor Bill Peduto, from Braddock, PA, Mayor John Fetterman.\nBut mostly, I'm here to say thanks. Thanks for taking time out to think about what's -- what the stakes are. I love you all, too. Absolutely! So for those who are still making up your minds or thinking, 'Maybe, maybe it's not worth voting at all,' let me just say: the choice in this election could not be clearer. It really is between division or unity. Between strong and steady leadership or a loose cannon. Between an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top, and an economy that is set up and run for those at the top.\nNow, I have spent my public career fighting for kids and families, and standing up for our country, and if you give me the privilege of your vote tomorrow, that is what I will do every single day of my presidency. I will get up in the White House, and I will think about what I can do that day to knock down barriers, to create opportunities, so that you have the chance to fulfill your own dreams. You see, I believe America's best days are still ahead of us. Now, that doesn't mean we don't have to work for it because we do. That doesn't mean that we can just expect it to happens as kind of a birthright, but I really believe that. I would not have worked for 18 months, travelled across our country, thought as hard as I have about what we need to do and how to do it together, proudly stand up and defend the legacy of President Obama, which has given our country progress in the right direction if I did not believe with all my heart that we could do this.\nRight? We can do this! We don't have to accept a dark and divisive vision for America. Tomorrow, you can vote for a hopeful, inclusive, big-hearted America. And our core values are being tested in this election. And I know that people are frustrated, a lot of people feel left out and left behind. There's fear, even anger, in our country. But I've got to say: anger is not a plan, my friends. If we're going to harness our energy and try to overcome our problems, then we've got to start talking to each other again, and we have to get good ideas wherever they come from.\nLast night in Manchester, New Hampshire, I was with Khizr Khan, whose son was killed while serving in Iraq. You might remember him from the Democratic Convention. He was not a man to be on the stage of a political convention, but when he heard my opponent say what he said about Muslims and he looked at the flag that had been draped on his son's coffin, he felt compelled to speak out. He spoke powerfully about what America means to him and how we have to defend our values and our Constitution.\nAs he said last night, his son serving in the United States Army with his unit saw something suspicious, moved toward it to check it out telling his men to stay behind, and when the car exploded, he lost his life. He was awarded Bronze Star and the Purple Heart, but as Mr. Khan said, \"When you listen to all the people that my opponent has insulted and denigrated, would there be a place in Donald Trump's America for Captain Khan?\" The Khan family gives me hope because they truly believe in the values of this great country of ours, and they have stood up holding the Constitution as he did at the convention to say, \"People around the world cherish this Constitution, believe in our values. It's a source of hope for billions of people. We will never, ever let that go, and we never let someone rip it away in the kind of negative, divisive, hateful campaign that we have seen from the other side in this election.\"\nSometimes when I hear my opponent speak, I don't recognize the country he's talking about. That doesn't mean we don't have problems and challenges, it doesn't mean that we don't have to do more to help people across our country get better economic opportunities. Of course, we do. But boy, I believe we can do it. I love our country. I believe in the American people. I know what we are capable of. Throughout of history, generations of Americans have risen together to meet the tests of their time. They defended democracy, built the greatest middle class that the world has ever seen, marched for civil rights and voting rights, for workers rights and women's rights, LGBT rights, and rights for people with disabilities.\nTomorrow, we face the test of our time, will we be coming together as a nation or getting further apart? Will we set goals that all of us can help meet? Or will we turn on each other and pit one group of Americans against another?\nNow, our names will be on the ballot tomorrow, but those values and every issue you care about will be there, too. What kind of country do we want, and I particularly think about this for young people as I look at this crowd and see so many students and young Americans that deserve the same opportunities that many of us were given. We will make sure they are available because if you think about what it takes to have a thriving America, it comes down to a couple of key issues.\nIf you believe that America thrives when the middle class thrives, then you have to vote. We're going to make the biggest investment in good-paying jobs since World War II, jobs in infrastructure, small business, clean energy, advanced manufacturing. We're going to actually deliver on that unlike my opponent, who makes his products mostly overseas, buys cheap Chinese steel and aluminum instead of what's made by American steelworkers right here in Pennsylvania. We're going to invest in America, and we're especially going to invest in communities that are left out and left behind. We're going to stand up for the right of workers to organize and bargain. We're going to get incomes rising across America.\nAnd if you believe we need a fairer economy as I do, then we're going to raise the national minimum wage, because no one who works full time in America should still be in poverty. And we're going to do more to support working families with affordable child care, paid leave, and finally, equal pay for women's work.\nI've got to tell you, this always get's about the biggest applause ever because fundamentally, we know it's not fair, but it's also about families. If you have a mother, a wife, a sister or a daughter who's working, you don't want her shortchanged, do you? Now, when I talk about equal pay and all of these other family issues, my opponent says I'm playing the woman's card. Well, you know what I say: deal me in.\nIf you believe all our kids should have good schools and good teachers, no matter what zip code they live in, then you have to vote. If you believe we can make college affordable for every young American, then you have got to vote.\nI've got to say, I was very proud of the primary campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran. It was a campaign on issues and ideas, not insults. And after it was over, he and I got together, and we came up with this plan. Public colleges and universities should be tuition-free for everyone who makes less than $125,000 a year. And it should be debt free for everybody else. I don't think you should go into this massive debt to get your education. It's good for you, it's good for your families, it's good for our country, and we're going to make it affordable for everyone. And for the millions of Americans already struggling with student debt, we're going to ease that burden. We're going to get those interest rates down, we're going to give you a different way of repaying it as a percentage of your income, not tied to a six, eight, 10 percent interest rate, and you're never going to have to pay more than you can afford.\nYou see, I think there are a lot of positive things to get excited about. And I think the agenda we've put forth in this campaign is one that will really give everybody hope. You see, working for children and families has been the cause of my life, but it's never been more important than it is right now.\nSo this has to be our mission together – doing all we can to help every American, especially every young American and especially every child, to have the chance to live up to your God-given potential. Because when it's all said and done, that's what matters the most. Have you helped somebody else? Have you reached out and tried to ease somebody's burden? We do it individually.\nMy mother got through a neglected, abandoned childhood because people showed her kindness. Her own parents didn't want her. Her own grandparents didn't want her. But that first grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat, brought extra food every single day to make sure my mother had something to eat. And when she was 14 and had to go out and find a job to support herself and got a job as a maid and a babysitter in somebody's home, she was just relieved that she had somewhere to live and that she could support herself. But the mother of that home understood my mother wanted to go to high school and so she said, 'Dorothy, if you get up early and get your chores done, you can go to high school. You'll have to come right back because I'll need you, but you can do it.'\nAnd look, that sounds harsh to our ears, telling a 14 year old, 'Okay, you can go to high school but you have to come right back and you have to work on both sides of it.' But to my mother, it was a blessing. So when I think about what so many people have gone through to give us the opportunities that we had had, and I'm speaking for myself, my mother gave me the resilience, the grit, the get up and go. She told me, 'Everyone gets knocked down. What matters is if you get back up.' And we had a lot of Americans knocked down because of the Great Recession, didn't we? Millions of jobs were lost, millions of homes were lost. Family wealth was wiped out, savings account, 401K's, everything that people had worked so hard for.\nWell we've dug ourselves out of the hole and now we need to get up, and we've got to make sure we don't leave anybody behind. I see this man here standing with a sign: 'Coal Miners for Hillary,' and I'll tell you sir, I know how hard times are. And as I have said, and you can take it to the bank, I will not forget you and I will do everything I can to help people who have given so much, worked so hard throughout their lives for generations to build this country. We are not going to forget any American! But I can't do any of this without your help tomorrow.\nThis election is going to really set the course of our country. There's no doubt in my mind. Tonight, I'll be in Philadelphia with President Obama and Michelle and I so appreciate how hard they worked for me, but it's not for me. It's for us.\nWhen President Obama came into office, put yourself in his shoes -- this young, dynamic, first African-American elected to become President of the United States. And what does he find? He finds the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, that's what he finds.\nWow, those were hard, hard times. I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for making sure we didn't go even deeper in the ditch we were in. But make no mistake: there were reasons we ended up in that ditch. It didn't happen by accident. We had huge tax cuts on the wealthy, the administration in office took their eyes off the financial markets and we know what happened. They ignored the pressures in the mortgage markets and we know what happened.\nElections have consequences for everything we care about. And that's why we've got to each and every one of you put down your stake in our future. If the lines are long tomorrow, please wait. In early voting, we have had people waiting in line for two and three hours and there have been reporters and others going up and down the line, asking them, all types of Americans, not one type -- all types, 'Why are you here?' 'Because my future depends on it,' they say.\nSo tomorrow is the election, but that is just beginning. We have to heal this country. We have to bring people together, listen and respect each other. Now I know it's unusual for somebody running for president to say this, I started saying this months ago, because I was literally meeting who were scared about what they were hearing in this election. I've known a lot of the Republicans who've run for president been elected president in recent history, I didn't agree with them on everything, obviously we had our differences, but I didn't doubt that they were fit to serve as president. This election is different. This person is temperamentally unqualified, experientially unqualified to be president and so many people know that.\nSo I think we do need more love and kindness, right? We have to got to rise above all of this hate filled rhetoric, all of these insults and scapegoating and finger pointing and insulting. I want to be a president for all Americans. Not just some. I want to be the president for Democrats, Republicans and Independents. I want to be the president for those who vote for and those who vote against me. I want to represent everybody. Because I know we have a role to play in building a better future.\nSo it starts tomorrow. If you don't know where to vote, go to IWillVote.com. You can get all the information you need, the polls will be open from 7 AM to 8 PM. We are on track, as I said, to have a huge turnout. But we can only do that if all of you make up your minds, you bring all your friends, everybody you know, to make sure your voices are heard.\nThis is a historic, historic election and we're going to do everything we can, not only to win, but then immediately to get to work. And I especially invite anyone who wants to volunteer for the next 24 hours, go to hillaryclinton.com, text join, J-O-I-N to 4-7-2-4-6, stop by one of our offices. We would love to see you. Because when your kids and grandkids ask what you in the future what you did in 2016, when everything was on the line, you'll be able to say: you voted for a stronger, fairer, better America where we build bridges, not walls. And where we finally prove once and for all that, yes, love trumps hate. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2016-11-07", "title": "Remarks at the University of Pittsburgh"}

We have thousands of people outside trying to get in. But we should start. Do we agree? [applause]\nWe should start. So they'll come in. They'll come in.\nFirst of all I want to thank you. Special, special place. It's a special place with incredible people. In one day, do you believe this? One day we are going to win the great state of North Carolina... [applause]\nAnd we are going to win back the White House. [applause]\nThis election will decide whether we are ruled by a corrupt political class. You're seeing what's happening. Everybody's watching. Or whether we are ruled by the people. We're going to be ruled by the people, folks. [applause]\nThat is going to be the choice. A failed political establishment has delivered nothing but poverty, nothing but problems, nothing but losses. Nothing but losses. We don't win anymore as a country. We're going to start winning again. [applause]\nThey get rich by making America poorer in many cases. It's time to reject the media and political elite that has bled our country dry. [applause]\nAnd these are among the most dishonest people. They don't give you the truth, folks. They don't give you the truth. [booing]\nThey rarely give you the truth. You know it. And they know it. That's the scary part. They know it.\nIt's time to fight for America. I'm not a politician, I can say proudly. My only special interest is you. It's you. [applause]\nWe're going to bring back the jobs that have been stolen from you. We're going to bring back the wealth that has been taken from our country. We're going to bring back the miners and the factory workers and the steel workers. We're going to put them back to work. [applause]\nThe economic policies of Bill and Hillary Clinton have destroyed manufacturing in your state and throughout the entire country.\nThe corrupt Clintons gave us NAFTA. China's too horrible entry into the World Trade Organization. One of the disasters. The job-killing deal with South Korea. That was a Hillary Clinton beauty. And the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will be a total disaster. [booing]\nThat Hillary Clinton said this is the gold standard. And you know what? It is the gold -- she lied. She lied during the debate. She said -- hey, by the way, who won the debate? Did we win that debate? [applause]\nBut she lied during the debate. She lied during the debate. She said it's the gold standard. And then she said she never said it.\nDon't worry about coal. We're bringing back coal, sir. He's holding up a couple of...[applause]\nClean coal. Clean coal. Right? We're going to do clean coal, the miners. The miners are going to be back. Not if Hillary Clinton gets in. The miners, I guess you got to start thinking about something else. But the miners are going to be back. Clean coal. Clean coal\nYou know, thinking about it, though. Also, people, the press doesn't talk about it. Donna Brazile gets the questions through a debate...[booing]...but then it turns out to be a number of debates. [booing]\nWho cares about Donna Brazile? She's turned out to be not what people thought. She gets, illegally -- illegally. She gets the questions to the debate. She then takes those questions and gives them to crooked Hillary Clinton. [booing]\nNow, does crooked Hillary report it? Does she say I shouldn't have these questions or these answers? I think they gave them the answers also, right? No, she doesn't. They doesn't.\nI wonder if she had -- I wonder if she had the questions in my debates. I don't think so because she didn't do that well. I don't think so. I don't think so. But the years of betrayal will end. And they will end. And they're going to end quickly. They're going to end as of the day we take office, which is going to be very, very soon. [applause]\nThe theft of North Carolina jobs will end. You've taken in harder than most states.\nReal change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare. [applause]\nSadly, it's just been announced that the residents of North Carolina are going to experience massive double-digit premium hikes. Ninety-five...[booing]...of the 100 North Carolina counties will only have one insurer in the Obamacare exchange next year. Lots of luck negotiating.\nHonestly, it's not going to matter because we're going to win and we're going to terminate it. You're going to have such great health care...[applause]...for much less money. It won't matter. [applause]\nPremiums are searching. Companies are leaving. Insurers are fleeing. Doctors are quitting.\nBy the way, doctors, they're leaving. They're quitting. I have a friend who's a doctor. He said that I have more accountants than I have nurses, it's so complicated.\nAnd deductibles are going through the roof. Yet Hillary Clinton wants to double down and expand Obamacare and make it even more expensive. [booing]\nI'm asking for your vote so we can repeal and replace Obamacare, and save health care for every family in North Carolina. [applause]\nThank you. Thank you.\nThank you. [applause]\nPeople are pouring in, folks. They're pouring in.\nDid you see last night in Michigan the crowd we had? And the crowd we had -- by the way, how about 24,000 maybe 25,000 right next to Fort Brag. You saw that the other night. [applause]\nAnd we went to Minnesota. Minnesota's been treated very, very badly. We went to Minnesota where we're doing very well. Everyone said why Minnesota? That doesn't go Republican. It's going Republican this year, I'll tell you. Minnesota. Great place.\nAnd you know, you've been watching and you've been seeing and these people are being driven crazy, the dishonest media. We're winning Ohio. We're winning Iowa. We're winning, we think, New Hampshire. We're going to do great in New Hampshire. I hear we're winning North Carolina big... [applause]\nI hear.\nWe're winning Florida. We're winning Florida, doing really well. Headlines today are on drudge. how well we're doing in Florida. And I think we're going to win the great state of Pennsylvania, I do.\nThen we're winning plenty of other places. So we have to go. The big key, you have to go. You don't win a rigged system, folks. We're in a rigged system. You got to go. You got to vote. Got to make sure that vote gets registered.\nReal change also means restoring honesty to our government\nThank you. Thank you. Wow. Great, great spirit.\nI have a job right next to -- we have a beautiful, beautiful property right next to -- right near Charlotte. You know about it, folks? It's great right? Some of the people. But it's an amazing place. It's an amazing place to work and to live, and we love it.\nHillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the presidency of the United States. [booing]\nShe threatened national security, she sold her office to the highest bidder. And then to cover her tracks...[booing]...she deleted 33,000 emails after receiving a congressional subpoena, nothing happens to her. Nothing happens [booing]\nShe's being protected by a totally rigged system -- General James Cartwright. A four-star general. Two weeks ago probably going to jail for up to five years for doing nothing by comparison. But he said he did it for national security reasons and I can understand that. Go to jail for up to five years. General betrayes, his life was destroyed and here she is she is running for president 25 times worse than anybody has ever dreamt. It's a rigged system. It is a rigged rigged system. [booing]\nDon't worry, folks. The cameras will never spin around and show this crowd. They never do. They show my face and the two people behind me, not the thousands behind me. They never do. They never do. [applause] [booing]\nSo dishonest. There they are. There they are. My group. Women for Trump. [applause]\nWomen for Trump. [applause]\nThey've been following me, these ladies, for a long time. How are we doing? Are we doing well?\nGreat people. Women for Trump.\nAnd now it's up to the American people to deliver the justice that we deserve at the ballot box tomorrow. At the ballot box. We're going to win.\nI think it's a great way of showing what we have to show in light of what's going on with justice in this country. I really do. I think it's a great way. You show it tomorrow. We show it tomorrow.\nMy contract with the American voter begins with a plan to end government corruption and to take our country back from the special interests. [applause]\nAnd folks, I was on the other side for a long time. It's a very good place to be. But I love the country. I love this country. I've really gotten to love the people of this country because I have been everywhere. We have the greatest people on earth. But I love this country.\nAnd I couldn't watch it when they made the Iran deal. They gave them $150 billion, a terrorist state. [booing]\nA state that was ready to collapse until we made them rich and powerful. We gave them a path to nuclear weapons. They were ready to collapse. We gave them, remember, $400 billion, right? We gave them $400 million. Then we found out that was -- it wasn't $400 million. It was $1.7 billion in cash. In cash. Do you know what $1.7 billion in cash is? You could take that whole side of the arena and you wouldn't have enough room. How stupid are we to allow this to happen? Our leaders are incompetent. President Obama is campaigning today with Hillary Clinton because she can't campaign. [booing]\nShe can't campaign. [booing]\nSo Obama is taking Air Force One, which costs a fortune. You know he's very much into the environment. And he'll take a massive, old engine 747. Very much into the environment. Very much into the ozone layer. And yet he'll fly that 747 all over the place to campaign for crooked Hillary.\nAnd I don't think it's going to work. And she's not getting any crowds. So she gets Beyonce and Jay-Z. I like them. [booing]\nI like them. [booing]\nAnd you know what they do? I get bigger crowds than they do. [applause]\nIt's true. I get far bigger crowds. [applause]\nLook at this place. I mean, look at the crowds we had in Michigan.\nBy the way, Michigan is in play. It hasn't been in play for Republicans for 30 something years. Michigan is in play because they're tired of watching their car factories be taken out. They're tired of losing their jobs to Mexico.\nFord. Ford right now moved all of its small car production to Mexico. They're building the biggest plants in the world in Mexico. And Michigan has been complaining about it for five years to Mexico. [applause]\nNo, we're going to have some -- tomorrow's going to be a very historic day. I really believe that. I think it's going to show -- I think it's going to be a Brexit plus, plus, plus. Does that make sense? [applause]\nPlus, plus, plus. [applause]\nIt will be amazing. It will be amazing.\nI want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear the words we're all about to say. This is a phrase, I told you. I didn't like it. I thought it was hokie. But it's not hokie. It's called \"drain the swamp.\"\nWe're going to go to Washington. We're going to drain the swamp. Can't believe it.\nI told the story. I hated that expression. I said no way I'm going to say that, no way. That's so hokie. And I said it. The place went crazy.\nThen I said it to another place. It went crazier. Then I said it with more confidence because you know confidence is -- and it went wild. Now I love the expression. I think it was genius.\nDrain the swamp. Drain the swamp. [laughter]\nIs there any place better to be than a Trump rally? Are we having fun? [applause]\nAre we having fun? No? And I don't have a guitar. And I don't have a piano. All we have is great concepts for our country, which is the most important thing. Because frankly, when people get on stage, and they're entertainers, and they entertain in order to get people to fill up a room for Hillary Clinton.\nAnd by the way, they use the dirtiest language the other night. And it was -- many of the people left. You know they're political people. They heard words they've never heard before. They left.\nSo the place was half empty by the time -- actually, it never got full, even with them. Then it was pretty much empty midway through. And then most of the people just left. And when Hillary got up there was practically -- she might as well just have started with a few people. It would've been easier. [laughter]\nBut you know she hears those words. I won't use the words. I won't even address the words. Because if I do the crooked media will say \"did you hear what Donald Trump said today?\" [booing]\nBut honestly -- yes. [booing]\nThose words were disgusting. If I ever said those words that Jay-Z said or that Beyonce said the other night, you know what would happen to me? The reinstitution of the electric chair.\nIt would be -- how about if I got the answers to the debate? Or if I got the questions? Supposing instead of Hillary getting the questions to the debate, which is cheating. She's a cheat. She is a cheat. She never reported it. She is a cheat.\nSo supposing instead of her -- supposing somebody gave Donald Trump the questions to the debate. Headlines all over the world. He must withdraw from the race. You don't even hear anything about crooked Hillary. She got the questions.\nTo me that's such a big difference. Some people say, my people, oh don't mention that, it's just -- I say to me it's a big deal.\nIt's a big deal. But it's not a big deal for the dishonest media to say. They don't want to report it. But just think about it, supposing it was us.\nAt the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs. Bring them back to America. [applause]\nAnd by the way, you have a great governor. Support your governor. He's a great guy. [applause] Where is he? He's here someplace. He's a great guy and he's in a tough fight. And he's going to win that fight. But he's a great guy. So hopefully you'll support your governor.\nNorth Carolina has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and his lovely wife, Hillary. [booing]\nWell think of it. Think of it. Think of the numbers of jobs.\nHere's the one that gets me the most. Two things get me the most. Two things that just don't seem real. Because we're going to take care of our veterans, right? Like big league. Because our veterans are great.\nBut two statistics I can't believe. Twenty-two suicides a day for our veterans.\nThink of it. You wouldn't think that's possible. Because they're treated so badly. They wait on line for six, seven, eight days for simple procedure that could solve their problem or for a prescription.\nBut two numbers I don't -- it just doesn't make sense. Twenty- two suicides a day for our veterans. OK? It doesn't make sense.\nAnd here's another one. America has lost 70,000 factories. Now I thought they meant 700 or 7,000 maybe. It's 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization, another Bill and Hillary Clinton-backed disaster.\nThink of it though. [booing]\nThink of what 70,000 factories is.\nSo those are the two numbers. They just don't seem to be real. Sad numbers. Sad numbers. Especially the vets, to be honest with you.\nWe're living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of our world. There's never been anything happened to a country like has been happening to the United States. Our jobs are fleeing. Our companies are being taken. And leaving. And leaving.\nA Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America. And we will stop the jobs from leaving North Carolina. Believe me. [applause]\nIf a company wants to fire their workers and leave, as an example North Carolina, and move to another country, and then ship their products back into the United States through what will be a very strong border, by the way.\nWe will make them pay a 35 percent tax on every product that they ship back here. [applause]\nAnd here's what's going to happen. They're not going to leave. They're not going to leave.\nNow your politicians, some of them don't understand it. Some only cut taxes for the middle class. And by the way, Hillary Clinton wants to raise your taxes, and you know that [booing]\nSubstantially.\nSo one of the highest taxes in the world, she wants to raise your taxes. Same old story.\nWe will unleash the power of American energy including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal. Our plan will end the EPA intrusion into your family farms, and stop double taxation of a family farm at that. [applause]\nWe will cancel billions in global warming payments to the United Nations. Billions and billions of dollars. And we have no idea what they do with that money. I actually have a pretty good idea. You're not going to like it. And use that -- we're going to use that money to rebuild the infrastructure of our country. [applause]\nAnd we will rebuild our inner cities. The African-American community, the Hispanic community...[applause]...have had such lies told to them. They live -- many, many people living in the inner cities of our country, they're getting worse and worse. The crime is unbelievable. You can't walk to the store and get a loaf of bread. Often you get shot.\nChicago. Thousands and thousands of shootings since Jan. 1. You read it. The murder rate of the United States is the highest it's been in 45 years. The dishonest media doesn't tell you that stuff because they want you to like Obama. They want you to think Obama is doing a good job. And he's not. [booing] And he's not. [booing]\nAnd he's not. [booing]\nSo you live in the inner cities. You're African-American. You're Hispanic. The schools are no good. There are no jobs. And it's totally unsafe. And I say I will fix it. What the hell do you have to lose? I'm going to fix it. [applause]\nWe are all going to fix it. [applause]\nWe're going to fix it. We're going to bring back jobs. We're going to bring back safety. And we're going to get really good education going. There is tremendous potential, folks, in the inner cities, believe me, tremendous potential.\nWe will become a rich nation again. But to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation. Hillary Clinton wants a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees flowing into our country. [booing]\nUnbelievable. It's unbelievable. [booing]\nHer plan will import generations of terrorism, extremism and radicalism into your schools and throughout your communities. And you don't even know where they're going. Your government doesn't even know where they're going.\nWhen I'm elected president, we will suspend the Syrian refugee program...[applause]...and we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. [applause]\nHave no choice. [applause]\nWe have no choice.\nAUDIENCE: USA. USA. USA.\nTRUMP: We have no choice.\nBut we're going to work because we all have hearts and it's a big problem, caused to a large extent by Obama and Hillary Clinton.\nThe migration, caused to a large extent -- ISIS was caused by them. They left a big vacuum. There was no ISIS when she first served as secretary. There was no ISIS. She created it.\nNow she stands at the debate, \"I will fight ISIS.\" She's got no chance. She's going to fight nobody. She wants to go home and go to sleep. [laughter]\nUnbelievable. She's going to fight ISIS.\nSo we're going to build -- we're going to build, we are going to build safe havens. We're going to have the Gulf States who have nothing but money, they're going to pay for it. We have $20 trillion in debt. And if it's OK, I'm not going to spend a penny. We have $20 trillion in debt. And we still have to rebuild our country.\nYou know it's one thing like when you buy a company and it's got some debt. We have $20 trillion in debt. But the country's a mess. The roads are bad. The bridges are bad. The schools are bad. The hospitals are bad. The tunnels are bad. Everything's bad. The military needs massive amounts of money.\nSo we have all this horrible debt. It's one thing if we had it and everything's in tippy top shape. I like to say. You know I like the properties. Give me them. I want them. Give me them. But we have them and they're a mess. And we have $20 trillion, which is far too much.\nSo we're going to get it down. And we're going to rebuild our country. We have so many things we're going to be doing. We're going to be a rich nation again. [applause]\nA Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. [applause]\nAnd yes, we will build a great wall and Mexico will pay for the wall 100 percent. [applause]\nOne hundred percent. [applause]\nMexico will pay. If you look at the incredible -- if you look at the incredible deficits we have with Mexico, it's unbelievable. What we have, the cost of that wall is peanuts, is peanuts compared to the numbers you're talking about on trade with Mexico.\nAnd the numbers with China? Trade deficit? I mean we will have a trade deficit with China of close to $500 billion this year. We are going to lose in worldwide trade of goods, we're going to lose worldwide close to $800 billion. What are we doing?\nYou really ask, who is negotiating these deals? Where do these people come? You know where they come from? They're political hacks.\nYou're dealing with the smartest people in the world. You have Chinese people, every -- you have from Japan, you have from all these other countries. They put their smartest and the best. We put political hacks that don't know what they're doing.\nSo we have an -- and we have the greatest in the world. We have the greatest business people. We have the greatest negotiators. We don't use them. We don't use them. We use political people. Some of them got their job because they give campaign contributions. [booing]\nWe're going to get it straightened out, folks, starting tomorrow. Go vote. Go vote. [applause]\nRight?\nMy women. Hillary supports totally open borders. There goes your country. And strongly supports sanctuary cities like San Francisco where Kate Steinle was murdered violently by an illegal immigrant deported at least five times. We will cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities. [applause]\nWe will stop illegal immigration, deport all criminal aliens and dismantle every last criminal gang and cartel threatening our citizens. [applause]\nWe will also repeal the Obama-Clinton Defense sequester, and rebuild our badly depleted military. [applause]\nThere have been few times in our history where we've needed it more, few times. North Carolina will be at the very center of this effort with brand new advanced fighters flying from Seymour Johnson Air Force Base. [applause]\nBeautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful, beautiful new fighters from Seymour Johnson.\nAnd we're going to have more battalions. You know the Marines are way, way off in terms of numbers. You know that. I know. Has there ever been? Yes, there have been. But rarely do we have times when we need this strong presence like now. The world hates us. The world hates us.\nSo we're going to increase -- thank you. We're going to increase Marine battalions at Camp Lejeune. I've been to Camp Lejeune...[applause]\nThey make major new investments. Where I was the other night, right next to it. I guess like 25,000 or 27,000 people at Fort Bragg. [applause]\nGreat people. All soldiers are tough. A couple of them shook my hand. It was like oy, whoa. Take it easy, fellas. They are tough cookies. They are strong. They don't know how strong they are. These are great people.\nAnd new military technologies will be researched and developed right here at the Research Triangle. Right here. [applause]\nI'm honored to have the endorsements of more than 200 top admirals and generals, and 22 Medal of Honor recipients. And every day those numbers go up big league. Big league. Show Less Text\nAnd I asked some of the generals and admirals the other night by Fort Bragg. I asked them. I said fellas, let me ask you a question. They want to take over Mosul. Am I getting something wrong? Whatever happened to the element of surprise for us?\nI'm talking to admirals now and generals. That's what they do. I do other things. But you know it's called like common sense.\nYou got to say we've made a lot of right calls. I said why is it that four months away from going into Mosul they're announcing \"we are going into Mosul?\" We're going into Mosul because we want to get the leaders of ISIS and they're staying in Mosul. And then three months they're saying \"we are going in, in three months to Mosul.\" And then we're going in, in two months.\nAnd every time I hear, I put my hands, I go like this. I don't want to hear this, please. And as you know, they've been met with tremendous resistance, much more than they would've been\nAnd I guarantee you this. I can't say it with certainty, only about 99.9 percent, OK? I can't say -- nothing's 100 percent. Even our victory isn't 100 percent. But it's starting to look pretty close, isn't it? [applause]\nThose numbers. Those numbers. [applause]\nOh, these guys are unhappy. Look at them. They're not happy. They are unhappy campers. Starting to look good. [booing]\nStarting to look good.\nBut wouldn't it be nice if instead of announcing four months ago and there months ago. Then they have last -- two weeks ago they go next week we're getting ready to raid.\nThe leaders all left. They're gone. And the other people are putting up much more of a fight. Horrible. They're using human shields. It's a horrible situation. I mean it's hell. It's hell.\nBut why do we just watch what's going on. Hillary and her failed establishment have trillion dollars on wars in the Middle East that we never win. We just keep fighting and fighting. It's like a hose. The money just keeps pouring out. We never win.\nAnd now the Middle East is in worse shape by far than it's ever been. We have the Great Migration, the whole thing. They've dragged -- thank you. [applause]\nI don't even want to look. I'll get myself. I don't want to look. [laughter]\nThey'll make it -- I won't even say I love you too because they're going to make it a major headline if I said that. World's most dishonest people. The world's really dishonest people. [booing]\nThey dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe. Shipped our jobs and wealth all over -- right open at home. You ever notice we send these incredible troops, so much death, so much injury, in order to create a border for a country that most people have never even heard of. And yet we don't protect our own borders. Isn't it an incredible thing?\nThat will change starting tomorrow. [applause]\nBecause from now on it's going to be America first, America first. [applause]\nSo just in summing up, to all Americans I say it's time for a real leadership and time for change. We have to have change. [applause]\nCan you imagine having Hillary for four years? [booing]\nI'm being serious about that. I wouldn't want to watch the news every night.\nI mean look at what she's done with the e-mails as an example. I mean did you ever see a mess like this? Did you ever see -- of course the FBI -- the director was obviously under tremendous pressure. So they went through 650,000 e-mails in eight days. Right.\nSo sad what's going on. And she still deleted them after getting a subpoena from Congress. I mean that's a crime. What happened? That's a crime. You don't even need the new stuff. She shouldn't be allowed to run. Shouldn't be allowed to run.\nJust think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of a Trump administration. [applause]\nWe're going to have the biggest tax cuts since Ronald Reagan.\nAnd Hillary is going to raise your taxes substantially.\nWe're going to save and protect your Social Security and Medicare. [applause]\nAnd Hillary is going to cut your Social Security and really injure Medicare. That's what's going to happen.\nWe will eliminate every unnecessary, job-killing regulation. We'll cancel every illegal Obama executive order. [applause]\nBy the way, a man that loves this state. It's his birthday today. Billy Graham, 98. [applause]\nThe father of Franklin. Billy Graham. What a great one, right? Ninety-eight years old. He is a fantastic man. Franklin's a fantastic man. And it's so wonderful to have support of people like that.\nWe're going to protect religious liberty...[applause]...rebuild our military and take care of our great veterans. We're going to take care of our veterans. [applause]\nWe will provide school choice and put an end to Common Core. We move our education locally. [applause]\nWe will support the men and women -- these are great people, the men and women of law enforcement. [applause]\nWe're going to save our Second Amendment. [applause]\nAnd appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. [applause]\nThis sounds so good to me because I started this on June 16th of last year because I couldn't stand when I looked at what was going on with our country, I couldn't stand it. I couldn't stand it.\nComing down the escalator, right, with Melania. Coming down that escalator June 16 of last year. And they were all saying -- there were all the dishonest pundits. Actually a few of them thought I had a hell of a chance if you want to know the -- the smarter ones. But they were all saying but he's not involved with -- I've been involved with politics all my life, on the other side. But I've been involved.\nWe had 17 people -- by the way, one of the great people in here tonight, Mike Huckabee. Where is Mike Huckabee? [applause]\nHe's such -- is he here someplace? He is here. He is so great. Mike, wherever you are, come on out because you are great. I just saw him.\nBut we had 17 people of great talent. Ben Carson endorsed us. Mike...[applause]\nMike endorsed us. Tremendous -- I mean very talented people. And one by one by one -- and they used to say -- well I remember we were down to like 13 or 14. In one state I got 49 percent. And one of these clowns said \"he has not reached the 50 percent mark.\" I got 49 percent with like 14 people. How do you get 49 percent with 14 people? And they said he hasn't reached the 50 percent mark. They're very dishonest people.\nSo we ended up with 17 people, right? Don't forget that's hard because nobody else ever had a field that big or that violent, or that violent.\nAnd we have a couple that didn't endorse and that's too bad. You know they signed a pledge. They didn't honor it. But...[booing]\nBut -- no. But for the most part...[booing]\nNo. For the most part they were very honorable. But it was rough. They said it was the roughest primary every. I would say this is the roughest election.\nYou know the NFL ratings are way down. You know why? Because everyone's watching this. It's actually tougher. It's actually tougher. [applause]\nEveryone's watching. The NFL ratings are way down. A lot of people say it's because of this.\nSo you had 17 people. You've came down -- but we've got -- and this is a tribute to everybody in this room. We got the highest number of voters in the history of the Republican primary system. [applause]\nSo well done. [applause]\nThat's a long time. You know, starting with Honest Abe Lincoln, right. That's a long time. I got more than Honest Abe. That's really the only thing I did better than Honest Abe. Honest Abe was pretty -- he was pretty good.\nSo here's the beauty. You have one day until the election. And it's not even one day. It's a half a day. To make every dream you've ever dreamed for your country and for your family to come true. You have one magnificent chance. And honestly, in four years it's over, folks.\nThere has never been a movement like this. Even these dishonest people in the media say there has never -- Bill O'Reilly. He said it's the single greatest political phenomena that he's witnessed in his life. That's a pretty good statement. [applause]\nBut others have said it. Others have said it. Others have said it. And it's not going to happen again. It won't be able to happen again. Four years it'll never happen. So you got to get out there and you got to vote. Got to get out.\nSomebody said what you've done has never been done before. It doesn't matter if you win or lose. I said believe me, it matters. No, they said that. It'll be down in the history books. I said you know what? You may be right about that.\nBut if we don't win I will consider this the single greatest waste of time, energy. Wow do I -- you need energy for this. The single greatest waste of time, energy and money.\nI have over $100 million. That's a lot of money that I don't take in from the special interests because I don't need it. That's nice.\nAnd we have the biggest Internet -- you know the small donors? The small donors are giving us money at record clips. I think we had $82 million and then we had close to $100 million. And it comes in. And I think the average was like $61 each. I love those people. Those are people that love this country. [applause]\nAnd usually that's for the Democrats. You know in all fairness, that's usually for the Democrats to do that. But we're beating everybody. Nobody's seen anything like what we're doing.\nSo we don't want to blow it. We don't want to waste it. Go vote. Go vote. Because believe me, if we don't win, all of us, honestly we've all wasted our time, I'll be honest. Because nothing's going to happen.\nThey may say good things about us as a movement. Won't mean a damn thing, folks. You got to go out. We got to vote and we got to win. Change. [applause]\nChange.\nSo you have one magnificent chance to beat the corrupt system that you're witnessing today, and to deliver justice for every forgotten man and woman and child in this nation. Do not let this opportunity slip away. We're fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people, not the donors and not the special interests. [applause]\nAnd we're fighting, we're fighting to bring us all together as Americans. We're a very divided country. People don't realize we are an unbelievably divided country. We're going to come together.\nJust imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God, saluting one American flag. [applause]\nJust imagine.\nI'm asking you to dream big because with your vote we are just one day away from the change you've been waiting for, for your entire life. [applause]\nBecause if we win tomorrow, we will be able to make America wealthy again, to make America strong again, to make America safe again, and to make America great again.\nGod bless you, everybody. [applause]\nThank you. God bless you. Thank you, North Carolina. [applause]\nThank you, folks. Thank you.

Hello, Michigan! Go Blue! Can everybody please give it up for Chelsea Clinton? Oh, that—who arranged the weather today? Was it you? Nice job. [Laughter]\nIt is good to be back in Ann Arbor. And I know you guys are feeling pretty good right now—9 and 0—[applause]—9 and 0. It's impressive. Although I talked to Coach Harbaugh. He's all, like, no, no, nice game. [Laughter] We've got a long way to go. [Laughter] So he's focused. And I need you to stay focused, because I'm asking you to pull off another victory this week.\nWe've got 1 more day, Michigan. One more day.\nAudience member. Love you, Obama!\nThe President. I love you back. I do.\nBut tomorrow, tomorrow you will choose whether we continue this journey of progress or whether it all goes out the window. Tomorrow you get to choose between a politics of blame and divisiveness and resentment, or you can choose a politics that says we're all stronger together.\nI've got some friends with me here who believe in that better politics: your outstanding U.S. Senator, Gary Peters is in the house; Representative Debbie Dingell; Representative Brenda Lawrence; Representative Sandy Levin.\nSome people who aren't quite as famous, but I want to take a minute to thank, because I'm feeling a little sentimental. This is going to be my last—probably my last day of campaigning for a while, but not just here in Michigan, all across America. I want to say thanks to the organizers of so many grassroots efforts. There are some organizers here who got their start on my first campaign, and they have never stopped working: picking up phones, hitting the streets, living and breathing the hard work of change every single day. You are the best organizers on the planet. I am so proud of you. And it is because of you that I'm here today. And it's because of you and the work you do that we've got a chance to continue to make history tomorrow.\nNow, think about where we were 8 years ago. The thing is I just realized some of you were, like, 10. [Laughter] Some of you were, let's admit it, while I was out there campaigning, you were watching the Disney Channel. [Laughter] You were. She's nodding, it's true. I loved \"iCarly.\" I've got you. I understand. [Laughter] \"Josh and Drake.\" See, I know because I was sitting there—although I had a soft spot for \"SpongeBob.\" \"SpongeBob\" was probably my favorite. Because Malia and Sasha, they wouldn't let me watch what I wanted to watch. [Laughter]\nBut for those of you who don't quite remember 8 years ago, we were living through two long wars, going through the worst economic crisis in 80 years. And because of the resilience and strength of the American people, but also because you gave me a chance to put in place policies on behalf of working families, we were able to turn the page. We took what could have been a Great Depression and turned it into recovery. Our businesses turned job losses into 15½ million new jobs. We saw an auto industry that was flat on its back roar its way back to break new records; brought the unemployment rate in Michigan below the national average, and across the Nation, cut the unemployment rate in half. Last year, incomes went up faster than any time in 30 years; poverty went down any—faster than any time in 30 years. Twenty million Americans have health insurance that didn't have it before.\nWe doubled our production of clean energy, became the world leader in fighting climate change. Brought home so many of our men and women in uniform. Took out Usama bin Laden. High school graduation rates, alltime high. College graduation, alltime high. Marriage equality a reality from coast to coast.\nThat happens because people in '08 decided to choose hope over fear. And over the course of these 8 years, all across 50 States, I've always seen what made America great. I have seen you: Americans of every faith, every background, Republicans and Democrats, who understand that we're stronger together—young, old, men, women, Black, White, Latino, Asian, Native American, people with disabilities, gay, straight—all of us pledging allegiance to the red, white, and blue. That's the America I know. And there's only one candidate in this race who's devoted her life to that better America, and that is the next President of the United States, Hillary Clinton.\nBut, Michigan, all that progress goes down the drain if we don't win tomorrow. This race will be close here in Michigan, just like it will be in a lot of parts of the country. And I know it's been a long campaign. And the end of every campaign brings all kinds of craziness and negative ads and noise and distractions. And for those of you who are voting for the first time, I know sometimes you think, well, this is kind of strange. [Laughter] It's not always like that. I want you to tune all—out all the noise. And I want you just to focus. Because the choice you face when you step into the voting booth, it really could not be clearer.\nDonald Trump is temperamentally unfit to be Commander in Chief. And I—look, think about this—over the weekend, his campaign took away his Twitter account. [Laughter] Now, if your closest advisers don't trust you to tweet—[laughter]—then how can we trust him with the nuclear codes?\nHe's unqualified to be America's chief executive. He brags that he's a business guy. But we've got a lot of businessmen and women who succeed without stiffing small businesses and workers out of—once they've already done work for you, and then suddenly you don't pay them? And you basically say, you know what, because I've got more lawyers than you, I don't have to pay you.\nThis is the first candidate in decades to hide his tax returns. He hasn't paid his Federal income taxes in years. Which means that he's not contributing to our veterans, he's not contributing to our troops, he's not contributing to our outstanding public universities.\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. And by the way, since we're in Michigan, take a look at what he said about the auto industry. Now, remember, when I came into office, industry was flat on its back. And we made some tough decisions to bring workers, management, everybody together in order to revitalize the industry. Just last summer, Donald Trump said \"you could have let it go bankrupt, frankly.\" Audience member. Wow.\nThe President. Now—wow!\nNow, I want you to understand, had the Big Three gone bankrupt, or two of the three gone bankrupt, that could have cost a million jobs across this country. That could have killed Michigan's economy. But Donald Trump didn't stop there. He actually suggested shipping Michigan's auto jobs to States that don't have unions so they can pay their workers less.\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. Don't boo!\nAudience members. Vote!\nThe President. I—so he, I mean, he said this. Look it up. [Laughter] He said, squeeze Michigan, make Michigan hurt. Then your autoworkers would have no choice but to accept less pay. That is not somebody who's a champion for working people.\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. Don't boo!\nAudience members. Vote!\nThe President. Vote! He can't hear your boos, but he'll hear your votes tomorrow.\nThis is not somebody who's a champion for working families. For all his tough talk about China, he uses Chinese steel in his hotels. He's given jobs to Chinese steelworkers, not American steelworkers. For all his tough talk on trade, the trade war he threatens to trigger might well damage the auto industry all over again.\nAudience member. He's got to go!\nAudience members. Yes! [Laughter]\nThe President. Every time my administration has brought a trade enforcement case against China that's been decided, the United States of America has won. That's how you stand up for American workers.\nSo, to every autoworker on the assembly line right here in Michigan, to every small business owner, every barkeep, every teacher in communities that depend on the auto industry, I think I've earned some credibility here. Plants that were closing when I took office are working double shift now. The auto industry has record sales. I think I've earned some credibility here. Manufacturing jobs have grown at the fastest rate since the nineties, when another Clinton was President. I think we've earned some credibility here. So when I tell you that Donald Trump is not the guy who's going to look out for you, you need to listen. Do not be bamboozled. Don't fall for the okey-doke. [Laughter]\nIn his 70 years on Earth, the Donald has never shown any regard for working folks. I don't think he knows working people except for the folks who clean up in his hotels and the folks who mow the fairway on his golf course. He didn't care about working people then—he won't now.\nMeanwhile, Hillary Clinton is going to put forward the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II. Plans, she's got plans to grow manufacturing; plans to boost people's wages; plans to help students with their college debt; specific plans, not vague plans, not imaginary plans. Not plans that don't add up. She knows how to do it. And that's why she needs to be the next President of the United States, as long as you vote.\nNow, let me tell you something else I've learned about this job, Michigan.\nAudience member. I love you!\nThe President. I love you too, but I've got business to do here. Hold on.\nOne thing I—one thing you learn about this job is who you are, what you are doesn't change once you move in the Oval Office. It only gets magnified; a spotlight is put on you. It's like an EKG for your character. [Laughter]\nIf you denigrate minorities before you take office, then you'll denigrate minorities after you take office. If you think of immigrants as criminals and rapists when you're running for office, then that's how you're going to think once you're in office. If you mock people with disabilities or treat women as objects, calling them pigs and dogs and rating them on a 1 to 10 scale instead of based on their character and intelligence, then that's how you're going to think when you're in office.\nIf you insult POWs and talk down our troops and say you know more than our generals do about fighting terrorism, even though you don't know the difference between Shia and Sunni, then that's how you're going to conduct yourself as a Commander in Chief. You know, it's bad being arrogant when you know what you're talking about, but it's really bad being arrogant when you don't know what you're talking about.\nIf you accept the support of Klan sympathizers, if they say they really like what you're doing, and you're kind of slow to denounce or separate yourself from them, that's what you're going to do when you're in office. If you disrespect the Constitution by threatening to shut down a free press when they write things you don't like or threaten to throw your opponent in jail while you're in the middle of a Presidential debate—[laughter]—or discriminate against people of different faiths, that's what you will do when you're in office, regardless of the oath to uphold the Constitution that you have to take in this office.\nSo Donald Trump is uniquely unqualified to hold this job. But the good news, Michigan, is you are uniquely qualified to make sure he does not get the job. But you've got to vote! You've got to vote tomorrow to make that happen.\nAnd the good news is, you don't just have to vote against something. You actually have a candidate who's worthy of your vote, a candidate who is smart, a candidate who's steady, a candidate who's tested, probably the most qualified person ever to run for this office: the next President of the United States, Hillary Clinton.\nI will tell you, sometimes I get frustrated watching the coverage of this election.\nAudience members. Me, too!\nThe President. There's a bunch of it that has not been on the level. But I want to tell you something right now. The way campaigns have unfolded, we just start accepting crazy stuff as normal. And people, if they just repeat attacks enough and outright lies over and over again, as long as it's on Facebook and people can see it, as long as it's on social media, people start believing it. And it creates this dust cloud of nonsense.\nSo I've had to bite my tongue after a lot of the nonsense I've heard about Hillary. I know Chelsea has. Can you imagine? Just crazy conspiracy theorizing. But I know Hillary. She's somebody who's dedicated her life to making this country better. Think about how she got her start as a young woman. She was about her age, while Donald Trump and his dad were being sued by the Justice Department for denying housing to African American families. Hillary, about your age, was going undercover from school to school to make sure minority kids were getting an equal education. She has not stopped fighting for justice and equality ever since.\nShe'll be smart. She'll be steady. She actually respects working Americans. She'll make sure the economy works for everybody who are still struggling out there—folks who feel like they're not getting a fair shake. She will work her heart out to create jobs that families can live on; childcare that you can afford. She'll fight for students who are struggling with college debt. She'll fight to make sure that women get paid the same for doing the same work as a guy.\nShe knows workers deserve a higher minimum wage. She knows how the world works. She will make sure to keep America strong and respected. She won't turn people against each other just to win an election. She will be a leader for all of us because she knows we're stronger together.\nAnd that's what this all comes down to, Michigan. I said this before: the most important office in a democracy is not President, it's not Senator, it's not Congressman or mayor, it is the office of citizen. The most powerful word in our democracy is the word \"we.\" We, the people. We shall overcome. Yes, we can. America has never been——\nAudience members. Yes, we can! Yes, we can! Yes, we can!\nThe President. America is not about one—what one person can do for you. I didn't say, \"Yes, I can.\" I said, \"Yes, we can.\" I told you, I wasn't a perfect man, wouldn't be a perfect President, but I said, I will work alongside you, I will work as hard as I can to make sure that all of us together can advance the causes we believe in. What we can achieve together through this sometimes frustrating, often slow, but ultimately enduring role that we play in self-government.\nThis is what this country runs on, is you, deciding that you care enough about it to get involved, even when the odds are steep, even when the road is long. That's our history. That's why patriots chose revolution over tyranny. That's how GIs your age defeated fascism. That's how women found the courage to reach for the ballot. That's how marchers crossed a bridge in Selma. That's how workers organized for collective bargaining and better wages. They did it together.\nIn this country, you don't have to be born to wealth or privilege to make a difference. You don't have to practice a certain faith or look a certain way to bend the arc of history in a better direction. \"We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal; that we are endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights.\" That's what makes America exceptional: all of us equal, all of us having a voice, all of us making a claim on the American Dream. All of us fulfilling our responsibilities, and not just enjoying the rights of this incredible Nation, this amazing experiment in self-government. That's what it's about.\nAnd so, Michigan, whatever credibility I've earned after 8 years as President, I am asking you to trust me on this one. I already voted. I voted for Hillary Clinton, because I am absolutely confident that when she is President, this country will be in good hands.\nAnd I'm asking you to do the same, especially the young people here. It isn't that often in your life where you know you can make a difference. Not that often you've got a chance to move history in a better direction. This is one of those moments. This is one of those moments. Don't let it slip away. You have the chance to reject a coarse, divisive, mean-spirited politics that would take us backwards. You can elect a leader who's spent her entire life trying to appeal to the better natures—angels of our nature. You have a chance to elect our first female President, a President who will be an example for our daughters and our sons.\nAnd so, after all the noise, after the negative ads, after all the campaigning, all the rallies, it now just comes down to you. It's out of Hillary's hands now. It's out of Michelle's hands. It's out of my hands. It's in your hands. The fate of our democracy depends on what you do when you step into that voting booth tomorrow, how many people you bring to make sure they vote.\nDo not fall into the easy cynicism that says your vote doesn't matter, all politicians are the same. That's what special interests and lobbyists, my opponents, Hillary's opponents, that's what they want you to think so you don't go vote. Your vote matters. There are States where I won two votes a precinct. That's how I won that State. Your voice matters. Your voice makes a difference. I have heard it.\nAnd for all the tough lessons that I've learned during this Presidency, for all the times I've fallen short, I have told Hillary, and I'll tell you, what's picked me up every single time, what has gotten me working as hard as I can even when I'm discouraged, even when I'm down, it's been you, the American people.\nTime and again, you've picked me up. The autoworker in Detroit who won the lottery but didn't kick back and retire, bought his wife one of the new cars he built, kept clocking away because he loved his work—that's who I think about.\nThe young woman in Sterling Heights who wrote me 7 years ago to say she was worried about her family's future in Michigan, then checked in again to say this year that her dad's supply company was hiring, she was working her way through Macomb Community College—she kept me going.\nThe woman in North Carolina who was stripped from the voter rolls a few weeks ago, but insisted on winning her registration back, wrote me and said, \"I remember the victories previous generations won for me and generations after me. I can assure you, Mr. President, I will keep fighting. If I haven't stopped fighting at a hundred years old then neither can you.\" A hundred-year-old woman, if she's not tired, I'm not tired. She's kept me going.\nSo Michigan, I ask you to do for Hillary what you did for me. I ask you to carry her the same way you carried me. I ask you to make her better the same way you made me better.\nAnd tomorrow, if you're willing to stand with me again, if you're willing to get your friends and neighbors and coworkers to the polls again, if you're willing to reject fear again, if you're willing to embrace hope again—then we will finish what we started. We will elect Hillary as President. We will remind the world why the United States of America is the greatest nation on Earth.\nYes, we can! Let's get to work! God bless you! God bless these United States of America! Let's go vote!", "timestamp": "2016-11-07", "title": "Remarks at a Campaign Rally for Democratic Presidential Nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton in Ann Arbor, Michigan"}

And two women you can send to join them in Washington: your Governor and next United States Senator, Maggie Hassan; and your next Congresswoman, Carol Shea-Porter. Your next Governor, Colin Van Ostern. And give it up for two great friends of mine: former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords and her husband and former astronaut Mark Kelly!\nI've got to say, because this is, I think, going to be my last big event——\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. Yes! I mean, we've got one in Philly. But Michelle is talking there, so I won't get any attention. [Laughter] So I want to take some time just to thank some very special people who have put everything they've got into this campaign, not just here in New Hampshire, but across America, and that is all the grassroots organizers who work so hard every single day. They don't get a lot of attention. Some of them started on my first campaign. They picked up the phones, they hit the streets. They just live and breathe the hard work of change. I could not be prouder of them. They're the best organizers on the planet, and I could not be more proud of you. So thank you, organizers, for the great work you do.\nAudience member. I love you!\nThe President. I love you back. I do.\nSo, 1 more day, New Hampshire. One more day. One more day and you——\nAudience member. [Inaudible]\nThe President. Okay! I can't hear you, but I appreciate you.\nAudience members. Obama! Obama! Obama!\nAudience member. We love you, Mr. President!\nThe President. I love you too. I do. But—[applause]\nSo we've got 1 more day. And we can choose a politics of blame and divisiveness and resentment. Or you can choose a politics that says, we're stronger together. Tomorrow you can choose whether we continue the journey of progress or whether it all goes out the window.\nThink about where we were 8 years ago. Now, I realize some of you were 10. [Laughter] And you know you were watching Nickelodeon. And I was trying to think back—you had \"Josh and Drake.\" You had \"iCarly.\" Although in our household, \"SpongeBob\" ruled. So not only all of you were paying attention, so let me just reprise for you what was going on 8 years ago.\nWe were living through two long wars, the worst economic crisis in 80 years. But because of the American people and because we made some good decisions about what might help working families, we turned the page. Our businesses have turned job losses into 15½ million new jobs. Incomes and wages are up, and poverty is down by more than any time in last 30 years. Twenty million Americans have health insurance that didn't have it before. We doubled our production of clean energy. We became the world leader in fighting climate change. We brought home more of our men and women in uniform. We took out Usama bin Laden. Marriage equality is a reality from coast to coast. High school graduation is at an alltime high. College enrollment at an alltime high.\nAnd over these 8 years, across all 50 States, I've seen what always has made America great. I've seen you, the American people. Not just Democrats, but people of every party, people of every faith who know that we're stronger together—young people and old; Black, White, Latino, Asian, Native American; people with disabilities; gay, straight—all pledging allegiance to the red, white, and blue. That's the America I know. That's the America I love. And there's one candidate in this race who has devoted her life to that better America, the next President of the United States, Hillary Clinton!\nAudience members. Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!\nThe President. Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!\nAudience members. Hillary! Hillary! Hillary!\nThe President. But make no mistake, all that progress goes down the drain if we don't win tomorrow. And New Hampshire, it's a small State, but it's an important State. There are some scenarios where Hillary doesn't win if she doesn't win New Hampshire. So it depends on you. I know this has been a long campaign, and I know it's been full of negative ads and distractions and noise. I want you to tune all that out. I want you to focus. Because the choice you face when you step into that voting booth could not be clearer.\nDonald Trump is temperamentally unfit to be Commander in Chief. This is not just my opinion, this is the opinion of a lot of Republicans. Think about it. Over the weekend, his campaign took his Twitter account away from him. [Laughter] If your closest advisers don't trust you to tweet, how can you trust him with the nuclear codes? You can't do it. [Applause] Am I wrong about that?\nHe is uniquely unqualified to be America's chief executive. He says he's a business guy. But we've got a lot of great business men and women, including right here in New Hampshire, who don't try to succeed by stiffing small businesses who did work for him or stiffing workers what they owe them. This is the first candidate in decades to hide his tax returns, partly because he hasn't paid any Federal income taxes. He thinks that's smart, but that means he's not making a dime's worth of contribution to caring for our veterans, to supporting our troops, to rebuilding our roads, to building up our public colleges and universities.\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. Don't boo!\nAudience members. Vote!\nThe President. Vote! He can't—New Hampshire, Donald Trump can't hear your boos, but he can hear your votes.\nHe's got nothing serious to offer on jobs. There hasn't been enough talk about this economy in this election. And you know why? Because we've created jobs for 73 months in a row now. Wages are rising. Just last week, the unemployment rate was at 4.9 percent; that's near the lowest levels in nearly 9 years.\nSo Donald Trump generally avoids facts, or he just denies them. So he said this is a \"disaster.\" A disaster? [Laughter] Listen, I just came from Michigan. You want to know what a real disaster looks like, think back to that State and what we were dealing with 8 years ago. The American auto industry was flat on its back. Unemployment was soaring. Today's plants across that State and across the region that were shut down, they're now doing double shifts. And you know what Donald Trump's idea—Donald Trump's idea for the auto industry? He actually suggested that Michigan should send its auto jobs to States that pay their workers less. And by making Michigan workers suffer, they'd have no choice but to accept less pay if they wanted to get their jobs back. Does that sound——\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. Don't boo. What are you supposed to do?\nAudience members. Vote!\nThe President. Vote!\nDoes that sound like somebody who actually cares about working people?\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. New England has lost mill jobs over the years. Would that be a good way to bring them back? Just send them down to places where they pay them less?\nAudience members. No!\nThe President. Look, we got manufacturing growing again over these last 8 years, first time since the 1990s. And Hillary's going to keep that going. She's put forward the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II. She's got plans to grow manufacturing, boost people's wages, help students with college debt. That's why she should be the next President of the United States.\nAnd, New Hampshire, let me tell you something I've learned about this job. Who you are, what you are, that doesn't change once you get into the Oval Office. It magnifies who you are. It shines a spotlight on who you are. But if you denigrate minorities when you're running for office; if you call immigrants criminals and rapists when you're running for office; if you mock people with disabilities and treat women as objects, calling them pigs and dogs and scoring them on a 1-through-10 test—if you do that when you're running for office, that's how you'll conduct yourself in office.\nIf you insult POWs and talk our troops down, if you say you know more than our generals when you can't tell the difference between a Shia and a Sunni—[laughter]—that's how you'll conduct yourself as Commander in Chief. You know, it's bad enough being arrogant, it's bad being arrogant and not knowing anything.\nIf you accept the support of Klan sympathizers, saying, well, I don't know what they're about, then that's how you'll be thinking when you take office. If you disrespect the Constitution, threaten to shut down reporters that don't—write things you don't like, threatening to throw your opponent in jail in the middle of a Presidential debate—[laughter]—if you discriminate against people of different faiths—that happens in other countries, but not this one. This is the United States of America. We've got a Constitution. You know, his buddy Putin may think that's okay. I don't think it's okay. The American people don't think it's okay. Come on!\nDonald Trump is uniquely unqualified to hold this job. And the good news is, New Hampshire, you are uniquely qualified to make sure he does not get this job. But you've got to vote. You've got to vote tomorrow. And the good news is, you don't have to—you don't just have to vote against someone, you've got a candidate who is actually worthy of your vote, who is smart and tested and probably the most qualified person ever to run for this office, and that is Hillary Clinton.\nYou know, there's—I've got to say, since my name is not on the ballot, there are times where I've been just kind of trying to bite my tongue. But there is a lot about this election that has not been on the level. But I'm going to level with you right now.\nThe way campaigns have gotten, we've come to accept crazy stuff as normal. And you see the strategy of just repeating attacks and outright lies over and over again. But it gets churned in social media and Facebook, and no matter how false they are, they just create this cloud of dust.\nAnd so I've had to bite my lip and just listen to some of the nonsense that's been said about Hillary. I know Hillary. I ran against Hillary. [Laughter] She worked for me. [Laughter] This is somebody who has dedicated her life to making this country better. This is somebody who cares about working families because she comes from a working family. Think about how she got her start.\nAs a young woman, not much older than most of the folks here, while Donald Trump and his developer dad were being sued by the Justice Department for denying housing to African American families, Hillary was going undercover from school to school to make sure minority kids were getting an equal shot at a good education. And she has not stopped fighting. She has not stopped fighting for justice. She has not stopped fighting for equality. She has not stopped fighting for kids ever since.\nShe will be a smart and steady President. And unlike her opponent, she actually respects working Americans. She will work her heart out to create jobs that families can live on and childcare you can afford. She'll fight for equal pay for equal work. She'll make sure that we've got a higher minimum wage and family leave that's paid so people can afford to use it and make sure that this economy works for everybody.\nAnd unlike her opponent, she actually knows what's going on in the world. She's traveled around the world. She's respected around the world. She'll work her heart out to keep America respected and strong and safe. And she will not turn people against each other just to win an election. She'll be a leader for all of us, even those who don't vote for her, because she knows we are stronger together.\nBut, New Hampshire, if you want Hillary to continue the progress we've made, she's going to need allies in the Senate, allies like Maggie Hassan. You cannot just stick her with Republicans in Congress who are already promising even more unprecedented dysfunction in Washington: more shutdowns, more obstruction, more repeal votes, years of hearings, years of investigations. Some are saying they'll block all Supreme Court nominations——\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. Don't boo! Audience members. Vote!\nThe President. I mean, apparently, they think only Republican Presidents should nominate judges. If you think \"Voting for endless gridlock\" is a good slogan, you should vote for the Republicans. And by the way, Maggie's opponent, I gather she is kind of running like maybe she's a Democrat all of a sudden. [Laughter] But in Washington, she supports Mitch McConnell. In Washington, she supports a majority that has consistently been about saying no to everything. She supports eliminating health care for 20 million Americans who already have it. So don't buy that okey-doke. There's a clear choice involved here.\nMaggie Hassan will make sure we've got a Democratic majority to work for the things you care about. Her opponent will not. It's a clear choice. America can do better than gridlock. If you care about creating jobs, you care about childcare they can afford, you care about equal pay for women and a higher wages for workers, then you've got to vote for Democrats up and down the ticket: people like Hillary; people like Maggie; people who will put you ahead of politics, who will involve all of us in the work of moving this country forward.\nAnd that's ultimately what this comes down to, New Hampshire. You know, I—the most important office in a democracy is not President, it's not Senator, it's not Governor or mayor—it's citizen. That's the most important office. That's why we don't talk about \"I,\" we talk about \"we.\" We, the people. We shall overcome. Yes, we can. I didn't say, \"Yes, I can.\" I said, \"Yes, we can.\" America has never been about what one person says he'll do for us; it's about what we do together, through the slow, and yes, sometimes frustrating, but ultimately, enduring work of self-government.\nThis is where you come in. You hold the most important office in a democracy. It depends on you. Even when the odds are steep. Even when the road is long. It's been ordinary people who have made the difference: that's how patriots chose revolution over tyranny; the GIs who defeated fascism around the world, they were your age; women finding the courage to reach for the ballot; marchers crossing a bridge in Selma for their dignity; workers organizing collective bargaining and better wages. You make these things happen.\n\"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that we are endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights.\" In this country, you don't have to be born of wealth or privilege to make a difference. You don't have to practice a certain faith or look a certain way to bend the arc of history. And that's what makes America exceptional. That's what's always made America great.\nSo with whatever credibility I've got after 8years as your President, I am asking you to trust me on this one. I already voted for Hillary. We've got early vote in Illinois. I already voted for her. I am absolutely confident that when she's President, this country will be in good hands.\nAnd I'm asking you to do the same and especially the young people who are here today. It isn't that often—it isn't that often in life, you'll discover—where you just know you can make a difference. It's not that often where you have a chance to shape history. The world is watching us right now. This is one of those moments. Don't let it slip away. Don't give away your power. You have a chance to send a clear signal: We are not divisive; we are not mean spirited. That's not what America is about. We're not going to go backwards.\nYou can elect a leader who's spent her life trying to move this country forward. Our first female President. A President who will be an example for our daughters and for our sons and send a signal, there is no glass ceiling, anybody who works hard and cares enough can achieve. And now, after months of campaigning, after all the rallies, after all the ads, it all comes down to you. This is out of Hillary's hands now. It's out of my hands. It's out of Michelle's hands. It's out of Maggie's hands or Jeanne's hands. It's in your hands. The fate of our democracy depends on what you do when you step into that voting booth tomorrow. It depends on whether you're telling your friends and your neighbors and your relatives that they have to go and exercise this power, this legacy.\nDon't dare fall for this easy cynicism that says my vote doesn't matter or politicians are all the same, because they're not. Hillary's opponent wants you to think that. Folks—Mitch McConnell wants you to think that. They don't want you to vote. In some States they've made it harder for you to vote. But your vote does matter. I won some States by two votes a precinct. Your voice makes a difference.\nAnd if you don't believe that, I want to leave you with one last story.\nAudience member. Don't leave—[inaudible].\nThe President. Some—I want to leave you with one last story, and this is for the young people here. This is for the young people here, so I want you to pay attention.\nNow, because a lot of you won't remember this, but when I ran for the Presidency in '08, the truth is, is that not a lot of people gave me a chance. I was a skinny guy with a funny name. [Laughter] And when I look back at the pictures of me speaking back then, like. I look really young. [Laughter]\nI—so, initially, when we started the campaign, the odds weren't for us. And we had a lot of States to cover, and I had never run a national campaign. And so we had to try to get any support we could, any endorsements we could. So we—I fly down to North Carolina—South Carolina—South Carolina. I go down to South Carolina for some State legislator's banquet or something. And I'm sitting next to this State legislator, and she hasn't made an endorsement yet. And I ask her for the endorsement. That's what you do when you're kind of trying to get support.\nAnd she says, you know what, Obama, I like you. You're a little young, a little green behind the ears, but I like you. I will endorse you if you come to my hometown of Greenwood, South Carolina.\nSo I must have had a little too much wine, because I just said okay on the spot. [Laughter] I was feeling a little desperate, didn't have a lot of endorsements, a lot of support back then. So fast-forward about a month and a half later. I'd been working in Iowa, I'd been coming up to New Hampshire, I'd been phone—calling people and trying to raise money. And I'm exhausted, haven't seen my family. I'm a little grouchy. And I fly down to South Carolina, down to Greenville, and I get in about midnight. And I'm exhausted. I'm dragging my bags through the airport—little airport terminal and get it to the hotel. And all I want to do is sleep.\nAnd suddenly, right as I get to the door, I get this tap on my shoulder. And I turn around and it's one of my staffers. Said, \"Senator\"—because back then I was just a Senator. He said, \"Senator, you do know that you've got to wake up at 6:30 tomorrow morning, right?\" I said, \"What do you mean?\" He said: \"Well, remember that State legislator you met, you promised you'd go out to Greenwood? Well, that's tomorrow.\" [Laughter]\nSo I'm muttering under my breath. I'm not happy. I go in, just fall out. Alarm goes off, and I feel terrible. I am exhausted. Think I'm coming down with a cold. I open up the curtains: It's pouring down rain outside! Pouring down rain. Horrible day. I make myself some coffee, and I get the newspaper outside my door and open it up. There's a bad story about me in the New York Times. [Laughter]\nI get dressed, shaved, walk out, just kind of still groggy, still staggering. My umbrella blows open. That ever happen to you? [Laughter] As I'm walking out. And I get soaked! Soaked! I'm just soaked. [Laughter] I get in the car. I say, all right, how long is it going to take to Greenwood? An hour and a half. [Laughter] An hour and a half.\nSo we're driving, and we're driving, and we're driving. It doesn't seem like we're going anywhere. Sheets of rain are pouring down. And finally, we get to Greenwood, although you can't tell because there's really no buildings in Greenwood that are more than, like, two stories high. [Laughter] And there are just a couple little stores, and there's like one stoplight.\nAnd we pull up to this little park field house. And I get out, and I'm sloshing around in the rain, and my socks are wet. And I walk in—and I've driven an hour and a half—and there are, like, 15, 20 people there—15, 20 people. And I will tell you, they didn't look any happier to see me than—as I did to see them. [Laughter] They were wet and damp, and they weren't really excited. They don't—didn't know why they were there. And so I go around the room, and I say, how do you do, what do you do, and talk to everybody. But they're not really feeling it right now.\nAnd so I'm about to make my pitch. I'm trying to muster myself up—let me make the best of this. I'm going to do it quick, and then I'm going to get out of there. And suddenly, I hear this voice from the back just shout, \"Fired up!\"\nAudience members. Ready to go!\nThe President. And everybody in the room says, \"Fired up!\"\nAudience members. Ready to go!\nThe President. And I say—\"ready to\"—and then, I hear the voice say, \"Ready to go!\" And everybody in the room says, \"Ready to go!\" And I don't know what's going on. [Laughter] I think these people are crazy. [Laughter] Maybe I shouldn't have come here.\nAnd then, I look in the back of the room. And there's this middle-aged woman, and she's dressed like she just came from church. She's got a big church hat. And she's got, I think, a gold tooth. [Laughter] Turns out, she is—holds a position in the local NAACP office and also—I'm not kidding you—is a private detective. This is a true story. [Laughter] She's like a private eye, although it's hard to think that you wouldn't see her coming. [Laughter] She's very colorful.\nAnd she's grinning at me. And apparently, she is known wherever she goes by saying this chant, \"Fired up!\" And everybody knows her, so they know that when she says, \"Fired up!\" they've got to say \"Fired up!\" And when she says, \"Ready to go!\" everybody has got to say, \"Ready to go!\"\nAnd this is what she does. Every meeting she goes to, she does this thing, which is kind of strange. [Laughter] So the thing is, though, she keeps on doing it. And everybody keeps on—she says, \"Fired up!\" and they say, \"Fired up!\" And, \"Ready to go!\" \"Ready to go!\"\nBut the interesting things is after a while, I'm starting to get kind of fired up. [Laughter] I'm starting to feel like I'm ready to go. And all those negative thoughts and all those bad memories start kind of drifting away. And we have a great meeting with these 20 people. And they all say, we're going to support you, and we're going to go out there and work. And even after we left Greenwood, the rest of the day, all the campaigning, when I saw my staff, I said, \"Are you fired up?\" They said, \"I'm fired up, boss.\" [Laughter] \"Are you ready to go?\" \"I'm ready to go.\" [Laughter]\nAnd it just goes to show you how one voice can change a room. And if it can change a room, it can change a city. And if it can change a city, it can change a State. And if it can change a State, it can change a nation. And if it can change a nation, it can change the world!\nSo I just have one question for you, New Hampshire: Are you fired up?\nAudience members. Fired up!\nThe President. Ready to go?\nAudience members. Ready to go!\nThe President. Fired up!\nAudience members. Fired up!\nThe President. Ready to go!\nAudience members. Ready to go!\nThe President. Fired up!\nAudience members. Fired up!\nThe President. Ready to go!\nAudience members. Ready to go!\nThe President. Let's go finish what we started. Let's elect Hillary Clinton! Let's elect Maggie Hassan!\nI love you, New Hampshire. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.", "timestamp": "2016-11-07", "title": "Remarks at a Campaign Rally for Democratic Presidential Nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton in Durham, New Hampshire"}

She rose from a childhood on the edge of the Everglades to become our Nation's first female Attorney General, a position she held for longer than anyone in 150 years.\nThe daughter of reporters—including a mother who literally wrestled alligators—Janet was tough as nails and never cowered in her fight for what was right. In her 15 years as Miami-Dade's top prosecutor, she helped reform juvenile justice, created Miami's drug court, and made protecting children the center of her work. As Attorney General, she insisted on transparency and accountability. Throughout her tenure, marked by high-profile, complicated cases, Janet was unflappable, never losing her candor, sense of humor, or love of kayaking on the Potomac. Above all, she was committed to the defining mission of the Justice Department: ensuring that all Americans are treated equal under the law.\nJanet Reno was an American original, a public servant whose intellect, integrity, and fierce commitment to justice helped shape our Nation's legal landscape. Her legacy lives on in a generation of lawyers she inspired, the ordinary lives she touched, and a nation that is more just.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "The President spoke at 8:42 p.m. on Independence Mall. In his remarks, he referred to former Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush; Chelsea Clinton, daughter of Democratic Presidential nominee Clinton; former U.S. Ambassador to China Jon M. Huntsman, Jr.; and Sens. Johnny Isakson and Lindsey O. Graham. The First Lady referred to former President William J. Clinton, who introduced her.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119633", "text": "The First Lady. Wow! Oh, my goodness! Wow! Well, thank you so much. Oh, my goodness. First of all, I want to thank Bill for that generous introduction. And thank you, Philadelphia! Look at you! Wow! What an amazing crowd! What an amazing night!\nThis is truly an emotional moment for me for so many reasons. First, we are 1 day away from once again making history. Tomorrow we have the chance to elect someone who is singularly qualified to be our President: our friend, Hillary Clinton.\nShe is a phenomenal woman who has devoted her life to helping others: kids in crumbling schools, families struggling to get by, women who need a voice. And let me tell you, when the going gets tough, Hillary is the person we want on our side, because she never gives up. She never quits. She refuses to ever be knocked down, pushed around, or counted out.\nAnd on top of all that, she is an outstanding mother, a loving and loyal wife, a bold and brilliant woman who is an inspiration to me and to millions across this country. And in just a few hours, we have the power to make her our next President. Now, how amazing is that?\nSo I am honored to be here on this stage on the eve of this historic moment. I'm also emotional because, in many ways, speaking here tonight is perhaps the last and most important thing that I can do for my country as First Lady. And let me just take a moment to thank you, to thank the people of this country for giving our family the extraordinary honor of serving as your First Family.\nThank you for your love. Thank you for your prayers. Thank you for welcoming us into your communities with open hearts, for giving us a chance, whether you agreed with our politics or not. Every day, you have inspired us with your courage and your decency. And every day, we have tried to make you proud and live up to the standard of citizenship that you set. Because we know that our words and actions are a reflection to the world of who we are as a nation, and more importantly, our actions are a reflection of what behavior we hope our children will emulate.\nAnd we believe that our responsibility to you and to this country does not end when we leave the White House. That's why Barack and I have been working so hard in this election, because we believe that we have a duty to ensure that this country is handed over to a leader that we all can trust, a leader who takes this job seriously, someone who is truly ready to be Commander in Chief on day one. We deserve a leader who will ensure that our daughters are safe and respected and that our sons understand that truly strong men are compassionate and kind.\nWe deserve a leader who sees the dignity and humanity in all of us and who will encourage us to see the better angels in one another. We deserve a leader who sees our diversity not as a threat, but as a blessing. A leader who sees us not as rich or poor, but as hard-working folks doing the best we can with what we've got. A leader who sees us not as Democrats and Republicans, but as neighbors and friends who all love this country; who sees us not just as Black or White, immigrant or native born, but as brothers and sisters who are all infinitely worthy, all an important part of this great American story. And I am here tonight because I believe with all my heart and soul that Hillary Clinton is that leader. And we need to do everything we can to get her elected President of the United States. And here's the beauty of it all: This election is on us. It is in our hands. If we get out and vote tomorrow, Hillary Clinton will win.\nBut if we stay home, or if we play around with a protest vote, then Hillary's opponent will win. Period, end of story.\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe First Lady. Look, it is important to understand that Presidential elections are breathtakingly close. They are decided by just 5, 10, 15 votes per precinct. So by just taking a few minutes out of your day tomorrow to cast your vote and bringing your friends and family with you, each of you has the power to swing an entire precinct for Hillary. And if we swing enough precincts, we will win this State, we will win this election, and we will continue the progress that we have all made together these past 8 years. We will do this. That is the power that you have.\nTomorrow, with your vote, you can stand up to those who seek to divide us and make us afraid. You can declare with one voice that we are always stronger together. Tomorrow, with your vote, you can say that this country has always been great, that it is the greatest nation on Earth. A country where a girl like me from the South Side of Chicago, whose great-great-grandfather was a slave, can go to some of the finest universities on Earth. A country where the biracial son of a single mother from Hawaii and the son of a single mother from Hope, Arkansas, can both make it to the White House. A country where a passionate, outspoken young woman, determined to do all the good she can, can go on to break the highest, hardest glass ceiling and become our President. That is the power you have and the history you can make tomorrow. But only if we get out and vote for Hillary Clinton.\nSo can we count on you?\nAudience members. Yes!\nThe First Lady. Can Hillary count on you?\nAudience members. Yes!\nThe First Lady. We've got to get this done. You've got to get out and vote. We can make this happen.\nSo I now have the honor of introducing my husband to the stage. It's my chance—perhaps the last chance I have—to introduce him as President of the United States. So I just want to take a moment to publicly say how proud I am of all that he has done for this country.\nI am proud not just of what he has done, but how he has done it: getting the job done in the face of unimaginable challenges, always going high when they go low. Showing us all what intelligence, dignity, and grace really look like, and never ever compromising his values or beliefs.\nLadies and gentleman, I introduce to you the love of my life, the President of the United States, Barack Obama.\nThe President. Hello, Philadelphia! Are you fired up?\nAudience members. Yes!\nThe President. Are you ready to go? Audience members. Yes!\nThe President. Thank you, Michelle Obama, for being my partner, my love, my rock, and an amazing First Lady.\nEight years ago, I asked all of you to join me on an unlikely journey. We set out not just to change programs or policies, but to rebuild an economy where everyone had a chance to succeed; to reform Washington so that your voices would be more powerful than entrenched lobbyists. We set out to keep America safe and strong, not just with the might of our arms and the extraordinary valor of our troops, but with the power of our ideals; to shape a changing America so that everybody belongs and everybody has a part, everybody has a responsibility.\nNow, we didn't know when we began that America would fall into the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes. But in the face of great challenges, in the face of entrenched interests, in the face of, in some cases, unprecedented obstruction and a cynical Washington, we stayed with it. The American people stayed with it. And because of your resilience, because of your strength, because of your faith, we turned \"Yes, we can\" into yes, we did.\nLook at the road we've traveled. We've seen America turn recession into recovery, our businesses create 15½ million new jobs. Putting more people back to work than all the other advanced economies combined. A resurgent auto industry has led the fastest manufacturing growth since another Clinton was President. Incomes are rising. Poverty is falling. Twenty million more Americans have health insurance.\nWe've doubled production of renewable energy; become the world leader in fighting climate change. Marriage equality is finally a reality from coast to coast. We brought home more of our men and women in uniform, took out Usama bin Laden. And almost every country on Earth sees America as stronger and more respected today than they did 8 years ago.\nIn fact, because Bill Clinton is here, I did some math, a little arithmetic. [Laughter] Under the last two Republican Presidents, job growth was basically flat. Deficits went up. Over our two Democratic Presidencies, jobs went up by more than 30 million, deficits went down, millions more Americans gained health insurance. So yes, with Democrats in charge, America is stronger.\nThose are just the facts. And with just 1 more day to go, we now have the chance to elect a 45th President who will build on our progress, who will finish the job. Who already has the respect of leaders around the world and the people they serve. Who is smart and who is steady and who is tested. Someone who comes to this office as well prepared as anyone who has ever run, more than me, more than Bill: the next President of the United States, Hillary Clinton.\nNow, I know it's been a long campaign. There's been a lot of noise and a lot of distraction. At times, it's felt more like a reality show or even a parody. [Laughter] But tomorrow—tomorrow, Philadelphia—the choice you face when you step into that voting booth could not be clearer and could not be more serious.\nOn the economy, Donald Trump is uniquely unqualified to be our chief executive. That's why most CEOs and economists don't support him. He would trigger a reckless trade war that costs jobs, strip 20 million Americans of their health insurance, roll back the new rules designed to check Wall Street recklessness and protect consumers, and would roll back the regulations we put in place to preserve this planet for our kids.\nOn foreign policy, Donald Trump is temperamentally unfit to be Commander in Chief. Don't take my word for it, listen to the Republicans who have refused to support him. He lacks a basic understanding of the world, justifies torture, suggests abandoning our allies. Over the weekend, his campaign took away his Twitter account—[laughter]—because he's erratic. If his closest advisers don't trust him to tweet—[laughter]—why would any of us trust him with the nuclear codes?\nMore than his policies or his plans, though, throughout his campaign, Donald Trump has shown utter contempt for the values that make this Nation great. Anyone who sees women as objects, minorities and immigrants as inferior, other faiths as presumptively un-American cannot lead this diverse, dynamic, bighearted country that we love.\nAnd so all of this should give you reason enough to vote tomorrow. But you don't just have to vote against someone, you have somebody extraordinary to vote for. Philadelphia, you've got someone outstanding to vote for in Hillary Clinton.\nI'll be honest, I have had to bite my tongue after a lot of the nonsense I've heard people say about Hillary in this election. I can only imagine what Bill and Chelsea have been going through. The vicious, crazy attacks, the double standards applied to her, they're like nothing we've ever seen before. And what makes it worse is that most of the people saying this stuff, they don't really believe it. They know better. Don't forget, when Hillary was a Senator, when she was my Secretary of State, she was really popular. People saw how effective she was, how she crossed party lines to get things done. Before she announced her candidacy for President, Republican leaders described her—and I'm quoting now—as \"very impressive,\" someone who does \"a magnificent job,\" \"one of the most effective Secretaries of State.\"\nWell, they were right then. I agreed with Republicans then. [Laughter] Hillary did a great job for America. She's a big reason why we're more respected around the world. But then, when it was politically expedient, those same Republicans began tearing her down. And look, when you're subjected to unrelenting negative fire, it takes a toll. But here's the thing about Hillary. She doesn't complain. She doesn't buckle. She brushes it off. Like the American people, she is strong and tough. And she knows that government service is not about her, it's about you: your struggles, your dreams.\nThroughout her career, Hillary has followed that Methodist creed her mom taught her: Do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, for as long as you can. And she doesn't plan on stopping now. And that's how I know she will work her heart out for you: for everybody still in need of a good job or a raise; for every child who needs a sturdier ladder out of poverty; for every student who needs relief from student debt; every immigrant who wants to contribute to this country they love; for every American who has not yet felt the progress of these past 8 years. She will work, and she will deliver. She won't just tweet. [Laughter]\nBut she will need your help, and she'll need help in Washington. If you want Hillary to continue the progress we've made, you need to give her allies in the Senate like Katie McGinty. You cannot—there she is right there. You cannot just stick Hillary with Republicans in Congress who are already promising even more unprecedented dysfunction in Washington. That would be hard to do, but they're promising it—[laughter]—more shutdowns, more obstruction, years of hearings and investigations.\nYou know, gridlock is not mysterious; it's not something that happens because both sides are being equally unreasonable. It has been a stated Republican strategy since I took office. And the only way to break it is to make those who engage in it pay a price by electing more Democrats tomorrow. Look at Katie McGinty's opponent, Pat Toomey.\nAudience members. Boo!\nThe President. Don't boo!\nAudience members. Vote!\nThe President. Vote.\nI've given him credit for working with us on background checks that 90 percent of Americans supported. But that position rings hollow when he supports a Republican leader who blocked that bill. And it doesn't come close to making up for his repeated votes to give tax cuts to the wealthy just like Donald Trump would, to block a higher minimum wage just like Donald Trump would, to repeal the Affordable Care Act just like Donald Trump would. We do not need a Trump-Toomey economy. We need someone who's never forgotten her working class roots, the daughter of a restaurant hostess and a Philadelphia beat cop, somebody who went to college with the help of scholarships and student loans. Katie McGinty won't just be with you part of the way, she'll be with you all of the way. And that's why you've got to vote for her.\nAudience members. Katie! Katie! Katie!\nThe President. Katie!\nAudience members. Katie! Katie! Katie!\nThe President. Pennsylvania, if you think endless gridlock will help your family, you should vote Republican. But if you believe America can do better than that, if you care about creating jobs that families can live on and childcare they can afford, if you care about equal pay for women and a higher minimum wage for workers, you need to vote for Democrats up and down the ticket: people like Hillary, people like Katie McGinty, people who will roll up their sleeves and move America forward.\nListen, I know we live in a cynical time. And I know elections and all the negative ads tend to heighten that cynicism. Just last week, a journalist asked me if I still believe the optimism I expressed that night back in Boston 12 years ago: that we were more than a collection of red and blue States; that there wasn't a liberal America or a conservative America, a Black America or a White America, there was just the United States of America. He asked me if I still held on to the hope of 2008, if I still believed in change. After all, he said, the country is so divided, Hillary is in such a close race with someone who stands in total opposition for all that you've ever stood for. Maybe your vision was misguided, he suggested, or at least, very naive.\nAnd it was a fair question. I had to acknowledge that I hadn't fully counted on the obstruction we'd see when I first came into office and had to save the economy. I didn't anticipate the way social media would magnify our divisions and muddy up facts. None of us knew then how deep the great recession would cut and how many people would suffer and how it would make so many people anxious about their futures and their kids' futures, even after the economy recovered.\nBut despite all that, I told him, the answer is yes. I still believe in hope. I'm still as optimistic as ever about our future. And that's because of you, the American people. In my visits to schools and factories, war theaters, national parks, in the letters you've written me, in the tears you've shed over a lost loved one, I have seen again and again your goodness and your strength and your heart. In 2008, you gave me a chance, a skinny guy with a funny name. [Laughter] And for these past 8 years, I saw how hard you worked in the face of impossible odds. I saw the values you teach your children. I saw the way you treat strangers in need. I've seen the young men and women in uniform who meet every mission and the military families who serve and sacrifice just as well and the wounded warriors who have never, ever quit.\nYou bet on me all those years ago, and I will always be grateful for the privilege you gave me to serve. But I'll be honest with you, I've always had the better odds, because I've always bet on you.\nAnd, America, I'm betting on you one more time. I'm betting that tomorrow, most mom and dads across America won't cast their vote for someone who denigrates their daughters from the highest office in the land.\nI'm betting that most Americans won't vote for someone who considers minorities and immigrants and people with disabilities as inferior, who considers people who practice different faiths as objects of suspicion. I'm betting that tomorrow, true conservatives won't cast their vote for someone with no regard for the Constitution.\nI'm betting that young people turn out to vote because your future is at stake. I'm betting that men across this country will have no problem voting for the more qualified candidate who happens to be a woman. I'm betting that African Americans will vote in big numbers because this journey we've been on was never about the color of a President, but the content of his or her character.\nI'm betting that America will reject a politics of resentment and a politics of blame and choose a politics that says we are stronger together. I am betting that tomorrow, you will reject fear and you'll choose hope. I'm betting that the wisdom and decency and generosity of the American people will once again win the day. And that is a bet that I have never, ever lost.\nPhiladelphia, in this place where our Founders forged the documents of freedom, in this place where they gave us the tools to perfect our Union, if you share my faith, then I ask you to vote. If you want a President who shares our faith in America, who's lived that faith in America, who will finally shatter a glass ceiling and be a President for each and every one of us, then I'm asking you to work as hard as you can, this 1 last day, to elect, my fellow Americans, this fighter, this stateswoman, this mother, this grandmother, this patriot: our next President of the United States of America, Hillary Clinton.", "timestamp": "2016-11-07", "title": "Remarks at a Campaign Rally for Democratic Presidential Nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania"}

On November 9, 1989, with the courage of their convictions and a longing to forge their own destinies, Germans from both the East and West sides of the Wall celebrated history as a defining symbol of the Iron Curtain collapsed. Twenty-seven years later, we pay tribute to the unyielding determination of those who chose unity over division, and we rededicate ourselves to carrying this spirit forward wherever core tenets of democracy and liberty are at stake.\nWhen President John F. Kennedy declared in West Berlin that \"when one man is enslaved, all are not free,\" he captured the irrevocable truth of the work that remains to this day. Our world is more prosperous and free than at any time in our history, with more people than ever before choosing their leaders through free elections and living in democracies with greater respect for human rights. But such liberty will not emerge across the globe in a single wave—building strong, democratic institutions and maintaining robust civil societies is the work of generations, and it is up to each of us to put our shoulders to the wheel of progress and fight for the future we seek. Whether in quiet struggle or boisterous protest, the Berliners who endured the division the Berlin Wall created and stood for remind us of the necessity to never abandon the values that have brought us as far as we are today.\nFor centuries, people of every nation have borne witness to great strife and tension in our ever-changing world—but we have proven we can always choose a better course through our relentless pursuit of freedom. Across oceans and continents, in recognition of World Freedom Day, let us reaffirm our commitment to carrying forward the enduring celebration of liberty that defined the fall of the Berlin Wall.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 9, 2016, as World Freedom Day. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities, reaffirming our dedication to freedom and democracy.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-11-08", "title": "Proclamation 9538—World Freedom Day, 2016"}

Partnering with community leaders across America, First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden's Joining Forces initiative works to ensure our country's heroes can thrive by combatting veteran homelessness, promoting their emotional well-being, and advancing employment training and placement—and we have made great progress. Today, the unemployment rate for veterans is lower than the national average, and veteran homelessness has been nearly cut in half since 2010. We also recognize that some of these courageous men and women have faced and overcome profound challenges, both physically and emotionally, in defense of our freedom. We must continue to provide high quality health care to our veterans and make sure they have the support they have earned and deserve.\nThe example our Nation's veterans set throughout their lives is a testament to the drive and perseverance that define the American character. Let us uphold our obligations to these heroic individuals and never forget those who paid the ultimate price for our liberty. On this day and throughout the year, may we sustain their lasting contributions to our Nation's progress and carry forward their legacy by building a future that is stronger, safer, and freer for all.\nWith respect for, and in recognition of, the contributions our service members have made to the cause of peace and freedom around the world, the Congress has provided (5 U.S.C. 6103(a)) that November 11 of each year shall be set aside as a legal public holiday to honor our Nation's veterans.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim November 11, 2016, as Veterans Day. I encourage all Americans to recognize the valor and sacrifice of our veterans through appropriate public ceremonies and private prayers, and by observing 2 minutes of silence for our Nation's veterans. I call upon Federal, State, and local officials to display the flag of the United States and to participate in patriotic activities in their communities. I call on all Americans, including civic and fraternal organizations, places of worship, schools, and communities to support this day with commemorative expressions and programs.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-11-08", "title": "Proclamation 9539—Veterans Day, 2016"}

[applause]\nSorry to keep you waiting; complicated business; complicated. [applause]\nThank you very much. [applause]\nI've just received a call from Secretary Clinton. [applause]\nShe congratulated us — it's about us — on our victory, and I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard-fought campaign. I mean, she — she fought very hard.\nHillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country. [applause]\nI mean that very sincerely. [applause]\nNow it's time for America to bind the wounds of division; have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people. [applause]\nIt's time. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans, and this is so important to me. [applause]\nFor those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people...[laughter]...I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country. [applause]\nAs I've said from the beginning, ours was not a campaign, but rather an incredible and great movement made up of millions of hard-working men and women who love their country and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their families. [applause]\nIt's a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds and beliefs who want and expect our government to serve the people, and serve the people it will. [applause]\nWorking together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I've spent my entire life and business looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world. That is now what I want to do for our country. [applause]\nTremendous potential. I've gotten to know our country so well — tremendous potential. It's going to be a beautiful thing. Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. [applause]\nWe are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.\nWe will also finally take care of our great veterans. [applause]\nThey've been so loyal, and I've gotten to know so many over this 18-month journey. The time I've spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors. Our veterans are incredible people. We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all. It's going to happen. [applause]\nWe have a great economic plan. We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time, we will get along with all other nations willing to get along with us. We will be. [applause]\nWe'll have great relationships. We expect to have great, great relationships. No dream is too big, no challenge is too great.\nNothing we want for our future is beyond our reach.\nAmerica will no longer settle for anything less than the best. [applause]\nWe must reclaim our country's destiny and dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We're going to dream of things for our country and beautiful things and successful things once again.\nI want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone — all people and all other nations. We will seek common ground, not hostility; partnership, not conflict.\nAnd now I'd like to take this moment to thank some of the people who really helped me with this, what they are calling tonight, very, very historic victory.\nFirst, I want to thank my parents, who I know are looking down on me right now. [applause]\nGreat people. I've learned so much from them. They were wonderful in every regard. I had truly great parents.\nI also want to thank my sisters, Maryanne and Elizabeth, who are here with us tonight. And, where are they? They're here someplace. They're very shy, actually. And my brother Robert — my great friend. Where is Robert? Where is Robert? [applause]\nMy brother Robert. And they should all be on this stage, but that's OK. They're great. And also my late brother, Fred. Great guy. Fantastic guy. [applause]\nFantastic family. I was very lucky. Great brothers, sisters; great, unbelievable parents.\nTo Melania and Don...[applause]...and Ivanka...[applause]...and Eric and Tiffany and Baron, I love you and I thank you, and especially for putting up with all of those hours. This was tough. [applause]\nThis was tough. This political stuff is nasty and it's tough. So I want to thank my family very much. Really fantastic. Thank you all. Thank you all.\nAnd Lara, unbelievable job, unbelievable.\nVanessa, thank you. Thank you very much.\nWhat a great group. You've all given me such incredible support, and I will tell you that we have a large group of people. You know, they kept saying we have a small staff. Not so small. Look at all the people that we have. Look at all of these people.\nAnd Kellyanne and Chris and Rudy and Steve and David. We have got — we have got tremendously talented people up here. And I want to tell you, it's been — it's been very, very special. I want to give a very special thanks to our former mayor, Rudy Giuliani. [applause]\nUnbelievable. Unbelievable. He traveled with us and he went through meetings. That Rudy never changes. Where's Rudy? Where is he? Rudy.\nGovernor Chris Christie, folks, was unbelievable. [applause]\nThank you, Chris.\nThe first man, first senator, first major, major politician, and let me tell you, he is highly respected in Washington because he's as smart as you get: Senator Jeff Sessions. Where is Jeff? [applause]\nGreat man.\nAnother great man, very tough competitor. He was not easy. He was not easy. Who is that? Is that the mayor that showed up? [laughter]\nIs that Rudy? Oh, Rudy got up here.\nAnother great man who has been really a friend to me. But I'll tell you, I got to know him as a competitor because he was one of the folks that was negotiating to go against those Democrats: Dr. Ben Carson. Where is Ben? [applause]\nWhere is Ben?\nAnd by the way, Mike Huckabee is here someplace, and he is fantastic. Mike and his family, Sarah — thank you very much.\nGeneral Mike Flynn. Where is Mike? [applause]\nAnd General Kellogg. We have over 200 generals and admirals that have endorsed our campaign. And they're special people and it's really an honor. We have 22 congressional Medal of Honor recipients. We have just tremendous people.\nA very special person who believed me and, you know, I'd read reports that I wasn't getting along with him. I never had a bad second with him. He's an unbelievable star. He is...[crosstalk]\nThat's right. How did you possibly guess? So let me tell you about Reince, and I've said this. I said, Reince — and I know it, I know. Look at all those people over there. I know it. Reince is a superstar. But I said, \"They can't call you a superstar, Reince, unless we win,\" because you can't be called a superstar — like Secretariat — if Secretariat came in second, Secretariat would not have that big, beautiful bronze bust at the track at Belmont.\nBut I'll tell you, Reince is really a star. And he is the hardest-working guy. And in a certain way, I did this — Reince, come up here. Where is Reince? Get over here, Reince. [applause]\nBoy oh boy oh boy. It's about time you did this, Reince. My God. [applause]\nSay a few words. No, come on, say something.\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus: Ladies and gentlemen, the next president of the United States, Donald Trump. [applause]\nThank you. It's been an honor. God bless. Thank God.\nThe President-elect: We will do a great job. [applause]\nI look very much forward to being your president, and hopefully at the end of two years or three years or four years, or maybe even eight years... [applause]...you will say, so many of you worked so hard for us, but you will say that — you will say that that was something that you really were very proud to do and I can...[crosstalk]\nThank you very much.\nAnd I can only say that while the campaign is over, our work on this movement is now really just beginning. [applause]\nWe're going to get to work immediately for the American people. And we're going to be doing a job that hopefully you will be so proud of your president. You'll be so proud. Again, it's my honor. It was an amazing evening. It's been an amazing two-year period. And I love this country. [applause] Thank you. Thank you very much. [applause]\nThank you to Mike Pence.

{"author": "Hillary Clinton", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119496", "text": "Senator Tim Kaine: My wife, Anne, and I are so proud of Hillary Clinton. [applpause]\nI'm proud of Hillary Clinton because she has been and is a great history maker in every thing that she has done as a civil rights lawyer and first lady of Arkansas and first lady of this country and senator and secretary of state.\nShe has made history. In a nation that is good at so many things, but that has made it uniquely difficult for women to be elected to federal office, she became the first major party nominee as a woman to be president and last night won the popular vote of Americans for the president. [applpause]\nThat is an amazing accomplishment. It is an amazing accomplishment. I'm proud of Hillary Clinton because in the words of Langston Hughes, she's \"held fast to dreams.\" She was inspired at a young age to an epiphany that if families and children do well, that's the best barometer of whether society does well. In everything she's done, she's focused on that.\nWe know she would have made history as a president in one sense, but we never have had a president who's made their whole career about the empowerment of families and children. And I was as excited about that in the Oval Office as I was excited to have my friend Hillary there and make history as the first woman president.\nI'm excited and proud of Hillary because she has built such a wonderful team. There is a...[applpause]\nThere's a beautiful and kind of comical parable in the New Testament about a vineyard owner who hires people to work and says I'm going to pay you this for a full day. Then he hires people at noon, I'm going to pay you the same thing for the half day. Then he hires people one hours work, I'm going to pay you the same. And those who started earlier in the day said hold on, we don't like this, that you're treating everybody who came late just as well as you're treating us.\nI'm going to tell you something, here's what I've come to know so well about Hillary. The team that she has assembled over the years of people that are so deeply loyal to her because she's so deeply loyal to them is inspiring. But I've seen that same degree of loyalty and compassion and sensitivity extended to the most recent folks who have joined the team, the folks who came to the vineyard with just one hour to go. Her loyalty and compassion of Hillary and Bill to people, if you're with you you're with you. And that is just something so remarkable.\nAnd finally, I'm proud of Hillary because she loves this country. [applpause]\nNobody — nobody had to wonder about Hillary Clinton, whether she would accept an outcome of an election in our beautiful democracy. Nobody had to ask that question. Nobody had to doubt it. She knows our country for what it is. She knows the system that we have and its warts and blemishes. She's deeply in love with it and accepts it. She's been in battles before where if it didn't go her way she accepted it, but then woke up the next day and battled again for the dreams that she's held fast to. And that love of country is something that I think is obvious to everybody, obvious to everyone.\nI want to thank Hillary Clinton for asking Anne and I to join this wild ride. We — about a week before she asked if I would be her running mate, Anne and I went up to Westchester and we sat down with Hillary and Bill and with Chelsea and Mark and with Charlotte and Aiden for about three hours of conversation to try to determine whether we would be the right people to be on the ticket.\nAnd when we got in the car to head back to the airport after the three hour discussion, I said to Anne, \"Honey, I don't know whether we're going to be on this ticket or not, but I do know this, we're going to remember that three hours for the rest of our life.\" And now, we've — we'll remember 105 days that we've had with this fantastic couple of public servants and all of you for the rest of our life.\nI'll just say this. Hillary and I know well the wisdom and the words of William Faulkner. He said, \"They kilt us but they ain't whupped us yet.\" [applpause]\n\"They kilt us but they ain't whupped us yet,\" because we know that the work remains. We know that the dreams of empowering families and children remain. And in that work, that important work that we have to do as a nation, it is so comforting even at a tough time to know that Hillary Clinton is somebody until her very last breath is going to be battling for the values that make this nation great and the values that we care so deeply about.\nSo now, please join me in welcoming Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton. [applpause]\nSecretary Clinton: Thank you. Thank you all. Thank you. [applpause]\nThank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. [applpause]\nVery rowdy group. Thank you, my friends. Thank you. Thank you, thank you so very much for being here and I love you all, too.\nLast night, I congratulated Donald Trump and offered to work with him on behalf of our country. I hope that he will be a successful president for all Americans. This is not the outcome we wanted or we worked so hard for and I'm sorry that we did not win this election for the values we share and the vision we hold for our country.\nBut I feel pride and gratitude for this wonderful campaign that we built together, this vast, diverse, creative, unruly, energized campaign. You represent the best of America and being your candidate has been one of the greatest honors of my life. [applpause]\nI know how disappointed you feel because I feel it too, and so do tens of millions of Americans who invested their hopes and dreams in this effort. This is painful and it will be for a long time, but I want you to remember this. Our campaign was never about one person or even one election, it was about the country we love and about building an America that's hopeful, inclusive and big-hearted.\nWe have seen that our nation is more deeply divided than we thought. But I still believe in America and I always will. And if you do, then we must accept this result and then look to the future. Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead.\nOur constitutional democracy enshrines the peaceful transfer of power and we don't just respect that, we cherish it. It also enshrines other things; the rule of law, the principle that we are all equal in rights and dignity, freedom of worship and expression. We respect and cherish these values too and we must defend them. [applpause]\nNow — and let me add, our constitutional democracy demands our participation, not just every four years but all the time. So let's do all we can to keep advancing the causes and values we all hold dear; making our economy work for everyone not just those at the top, protecting our country and protecting our planet and breaking down all the barriers that hold any American back from achieving their dreams.\nWe've spent a year and a half bringing together millions of people from every corner of our country to say with one voice that we believe that the American dream is big enough for everyone — for people of all races and religions, for men and women, for immigrants, for LGBT people, and people with disabilities. For everyone. [applpause]\nSo now, our responsibility as citizens is to keep doing our part to build that better, stronger, fairer America we seek. And I know you will.\nI am so grateful to stand with all of you. I want to thank Tim Kaine and Anne Holton for being our partners on this journey. [applpause]\nIt has been a joy getting to know them better, and it gives me great hope and comfort to know that Tim will remain on the front lines of our democracy representing Virginia in the Senate. [applpause]\nTo Barack and Michelle Obama, our country owes you an enormous debt of gratitude. [applpause]\nWe — we thank you for your graceful, determined leadership that has meant so much to so many Americans and people across the world.\nAnd to Bill and Chelsea, Mark, Charlotte, Aidan, our brothers and our entire family, my love for you means more than I can ever express. You crisscrossed this country on our behalf and lifted me up when I needed it most — even four-month-old Aidan who traveled with his mom.\nI will always be grateful to the creative, talented, dedicated men and women at our headquarters in Brooklyn and across our country. [applpause]\nYou poured your hearts into this campaign. For some of you who are veterans, it was a campaign after you had done other campaigns. Some of you, it was your first campaign. I want each of you to know that you were the best campaign anybody could have ever expected or wanted. [applpause]\nAnd to the millions of volunteers, community leaders, activists and union organizers who knocked on doors, talked to neighbors, posted on Facebook, even in secret, private Facebook sites...[laughter and applause]...I want everybody coming out from behind that and make sure your voices are heard going forward. [applpause]\nTo everyone who sent in contributions as small at $5 and kept us going, thank you. Thank you from all of us.\nAnd to the young people in particular, I hope you will hear this. I have, as Tim said, spent my entire adult life fighting for what I believe in. I've had successes and I've had setbacks. Sometimes, really painful ones. Many of you are at the beginning of your professional public and political careers. You will have successes and setbacks, too.\nThis loss hurts, but please never stop believing that fighting for what's right is worth it. [applpause]\nIt is — it is worth it. [applpause]\nAnd so we need — we need you to keep up these fights now and for the rest of your lives.\nAnd to all the women, and especially the young women, who put their faith in this campaign and in me, I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion. [applpause]\nNow, I — I know — I know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling, but some day someone will and hopefully sooner than we might think right now. [applpause]\nAnd — and to all the little girls who are watching this, never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and achieve your own dreams.\nFinally...[applpause]\nFinally, I am so grateful for our country and for all it has given to me. I count my blessings every single day that I am an American. And I still believe as deeply as I ever have that if we stand together and work together with respect for our differences, strength in our convictions and love for this nation, our best days are still ahead of us. [applpause]\nBecause, you know — you know, I believe we are stronger together and we will go forward together. And you should never, ever regret fighting for that. You know, scripture tells us, \"Let us not grow weary in doing good, for in due season, we shall reap if we do not lose heart.\"\nSo my friends, let us have faith in each other, let us not grow weary, let us not lose heart, for there are more seasons to come. And there is more work to do.\nI am incredibly honored and grateful to have had this chance to represent all of you in this consequential election.\nMay God bless you and may God bless the United States of America.", "timestamp": "2016-11-09", "title": "Remarks in New York City Conceding the 2016 Presidential Election"}
{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119580", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:16 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. It's been a while since we've met in this venue, so it's nice to get together again. I think this briefing is going to go a little different than we all anticipated it would 24 hours ago, but I'll certainly do my best to answer the many questions you may have in the aftermath of the election.\nLet me just say a couple of things at the top -- three things, I should say. The first is I think the President and the tone and the priorities that he exhibited in the Rose Garden are indicative of the approach that the White House staff is taking to ensuring a smooth transition and working to ensure the success of the President-elect in leading and uniting the country.\nThe second thing is the results of the election are not even 12 hours old, and I think it is far too early -- at least for me -- to discern exactly what message the voters were trying to send last night. There certainly is a lot of speculation about what that may have been. Most of that speculation emanates from people who predicted a very different result last night. So that's the essence of punditry -- nothing wrong with that. But it is why I think it's going to require more than 12 hours of consideration and investigation to get to the bottom of what was actually motivating so many people who cast votes at the polls yesterday.\nThe last thing is there are a lot of question that are, of course, raised about what impact the outcome of the election will have on the policies that this administration has prioritized over the last eight years. And I think it's going to be a difficult -- again, less than 12 hours after the outcome of the election is known it's difficult to offer a lot of precision in answering those questions today, but certainly in the weeks and months ahead, over the course of this transition, we may get some greater insight into that.\nBut so with those two cautions at the top, let me do my best to answer your questions today.\nDarlene, do you want to go first?\nQ: In all the campaigning that we've seen the President do for Hillary Clinton over the last couple of months, he talked a lot about her being the one to carry on -- to continue the progress that he achieved. And she often talked about being the one wanting to continue that progress. Despite what you said at the top, does the President feel in any way that the results of last night were some sort of a rejection of Hillary, but not only a rejection of her but also of him, since the two of them were so closely bound together during the campaign?\nMR. EARNEST: I think that's an entirely fair question to ask, and I think it's an important question to answer. I don't know that anybody has the direct answer to that question now because there are some relevant facts. The first is that Secretary Clinton won the popular vote. Now, winning the popular vote is not what gets you the keys to the Oval Office. You got to win the electoral vote. And I think everybody -- I know that everybody knew the rules going into the contest. But it does underscore the depth of support and enthusiasm for her message and for her campaign. And that is a testament to her leadership and her ability to build support for a national campaign.\nThe other thing that happens to be true is there are a lot of people -- again, the math requires this -- who voted for Barack Obama in 2008, who voted for his reelection in 2012, and voted for Donald Trump in 2016. And I think it's -- I don't have an explanation for that, to put it bluntly. But I think certainly all of your networks and all of you are going to spend some time pondering that question, spend some time looking at the returns, looking at the exit polls, and maybe even spending some time in some of those communities across the country where Mr. Trump -- President-elect Trump enjoyed such strong support -- support that exceeded the expectations of everybody -- apparently, even exceeded the expectations of the Trump campaign.\nSo that's a worthy question, but I'm not going to pretend I have a real direct answer for you. But it's one that's worthy of careful consideration.\nQ: Another thing that we heard him say while out on the campaign trail is that progress was on the ballot and that if Hillary wasn't elected all of that progress would go out the window, down the drain, would be lost. What does the outcome last night do for the legacy the President wants to leave behind -- from Obamacare to the Iran nuclear deal, to putting a third Supreme Court justice -- a justice on the Supreme Court, and more?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, Darlene, just with the caution that we're 12 hours -- less than 12 hours away from this election being decided, there are some things that we knew to be true before the results started being tallied. And one of those things was that the next President -- whether it was Secretary Clinton or Mr. Trump -- was going to have some difficult challenges and some difficult questions to answer with regard to a range of policies.\nWe know that our economy is facing some pretty intense headwinds from overseas. What's the kind of approach that the next President will take to ensuring that our economy can strengthen and navigate those headwinds in a way that benefits the American middle class and not just those at the top? That's a difficult challenge that any President would have to face, and certainly President-elect Trump will have to determine the best path for confronting that.\nEither President would inherit a country that has some deep and passionate political differences. And what will President-elect Trump do to unite the country? It won't be easy. We know that's for sure. We do know that he can count on the support of President Obama and Secretary Clinton, both who in the last couple of hours have pledged their support to him as he works to do that.\nEither President -- either Secretary Clinton or Mr. Trump -- would have faced a deeply divided Congress that appears totally dysfunctional, or at least it has appeared totally dysfunctional in the last two years. And it's difficult to know -- it's difficult to see how that's going to change. And they'll have to navigate -- President-elect Trump and his team will have to figure out how to navigate that situation. And it won't be easy, either.\nSo I guess the point is, it's too early to tell exactly what the impact will be. There will be an impact, but we knew there would be, regardless of the outcome of the race. And there certainly were some priorities where Secretary Clinton didn't agree with President Obama, and in a different scenario, she would be -- you'd be asking me the same question about some of those policy priorities, too.\nAnd what's true is that the President-elect has some difficult questions to answer and some big challenges to tackle. And it's why it's so important for there to be a smooth and effective, efficient transition from President Obama's presidency to the Trump presidency, because as Americans, we're rooting for the success of our President in leading and uniting the country.\nQ: Are there any more details that you can share about the phone call between the President and President-elect? Can you say how long they spoke? Did they get into any issues of any substance, or was it purely just, congratulations on your victory?\nMR. EARNEST: My understanding is it was not a lengthy call. It did take place very, very late last night. And based on the fact that there was a discussion about meeting in person on Thursday, the specifics of any sort of policy discussions will be left until then.\nQ: Was not lengthy -- less than a minute? A couple minutes?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know with a lot of precision exactly what the timing was. If there are more details about that that we can provide, we'll do so.\nJeff.\nQ: Josh, on the policy differences, is there anything that the White House or your administration will do in closing months to shore up priorities on policy areas like the Affordable Care Act, climate change, the Iran deal -- all of which now-President-elect Trump called into question during his campaign?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me start by saying that President Obama will remain in office and will be the President of the United States until January 20th. And we will pursue policies accordingly, including the kinds of priorities that you have just enumerated.\nWhat's also true is that the President-elect, in the context of a smooth and effective transition, will have an opportunity to get briefed by members of President Obama's team and actually have a conversation with President Obama himself about some of these priorities. And I'm not going to speak for him or predict exactly what sort of policy decisions he's going to make -- and he was pretty explicit on the campaign trail -- but part of a smooth transition is ensuring that they have the latest available information about the status of these policies. And that's something that our administration is committed to providing.\nQ: Aside from providing that information, is there anything that your administration will do to sort of put up a firewall to maintain some of these programs in place against what will probably be efforts to repeal, in Obamacare's case, or to slow-walk on climate change, or to rip up the Iran deal?\nMR. EARNEST: Jeff, our position on all those issues is well known and something that we've reviewed in here at some length. I'll spare you most of that. But I think the way that I'd respond to that is there's no specific thing that I have in mind that we're going to do differently now. Our plan all along was to ensure the successful implementation of those and other priorities, and we're going to be committed to doing everything we can to ensure the success of those policies between now and January 20th.\nSo the easiest example is the Affordable Care Act. This administration is going to continue to make a strong case that people should go to HealthCare.gov, consider the options that are available to them, and sign up for health care, and the vast majority of people who do will be able to purchase health insurance for $75 a month or less. That is a policy priority that benefits the American people enormously. Since the Affordable Care Act went into effect, 20 million Americans got access to health care. And we want to make sure that as many Americans as possible understand the opportunity that's available to them.\nThe President-elect, when he enters office, will have his own opportunity to set the course of health care policy in this country in a way that he sees fit. It's going to require some cooperation with Congress, and that won't be easy. But there's a lot at stake, and Republicans in the Congress have voted 50 times to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and each time they did that, they were voting to take health care away from 22 million Americans. They were voting to strip critically important consumer protections from people that prevent them from being discriminated against because they have a preexisting condition, or paying more for their health insurance just because they're a woman.\nThose are the kinds of protections that don't just benefit the 20 million Americans who got health care since the Affordable Care Act went into effect, but the 100 million or 150 million Americans that get access to health care through their employer.\nSo these are the kinds of decisions that the incoming administration and the incoming Congress will be challenged to make.\nQ: How do you reassure foreign allies, particularly on issues like the climate change deal, the Paris agreement, or the Iran deal, that these things will continue when the person who is succeeding President Obama said they wouldn't?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Jeff, there are a couple things. The first is, obviously, this administration will be committed to implementing those policies through January 20th and we will live up to the commitments that we have made in each of those areas as we do so. Second, there is a tradition, particularly with regard to executive agreements, of successive Presidents preserving some element of continuity.\nI don't know whether or not that will fly in this case. But as a part of this effective, smooth transition, President Obama will have an opportunity to talk to President-elect Trump about some of these policies and about some of the benefits of some of these policies. The President-elect's team will have an opportunity to get briefed by the national security experts here in the Obama administration that have been working on implementing these policies. But, ultimately, the President-elect will be the person that is responsible for setting the path of foreign policy for the United States for the next four years.\nAnd presumably, some of that strategy that he will pursue will involve reassuring the allies that enhance the national security of the United States. That certainly was part of President Obama's -- the foreign policy path that President Obama charted, and previous Presidents have as well. But obviously President-elect Trump will have to make that decision for himself once he enters the Oval Office on the afternoon of January 20th.\nApril.\nQ: Josh, I want to go back to the firewall and ACA, and his conversation tomorrow. Is this a tomorrow conversation? Is this a conversation that's going to continue when it comes to ACA, a legacy piece for this President? And what would that conversation look like that the President would offer to Donald Trump about ACA and its viability -- tweaking but not getting rid of it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, April, the thing I can for sure tell you is the President's top priority is not his legacy but the 20 million Americans who have health insurance -- or who got their health insurance since the Affordable Care Act went into effect. He is quite concerned about stripping protections from the more than 100 million Americans who benefit from protections that prevent insurance companies from discriminating against them because of a preexisting condition, or imposing lifetime caps that certainly put young people with an illness at pretty great risk. Those are the kinds of consumer protections that are part and parcel of the Affordable Care Act, and tearing them away would negatively affect a lot of people. And that's something that Republicans will have to consider moving forward.\nIn terms of these kinds of conversations, the way that the transition is structured is that there are transition teams that have been designated across the agencies at the federal government. And the President-elect's transition team has designated teams to work with those individual agency teams to ensure a smooth transition. So there will be a venue for staff-level conversations to take place -- high-level, staff-level conversations. But I wouldn't predict at this point whether or not this will come up in the conversation between President Obama and President-elect Trump, but if this is something that President-elect Trump is interested in talking about, I'm confident that President Obama won't hesitate to spend some time doing so.\nQ: And last question. On the issue of unifying the nation after what this White House calls a hard-fought election cycle, many are looking at -- many people, be it Democrat or Republican, black or white -- they're looking at what's going to come in the next four years. A Supreme Court that's going to lean to the right. The House and Senate majority Republican and the White House a Republican President. I talked to someone this morning -- a black Republican, Christopher Darden, a former O.J. Simpson prosecutor -- who said this is going to create a new type of activism in this nation. How do you marry the thought of this new activism and the unification that the President has talked about at the same time?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President in some ways addressed this in his remarks in the Rose Garden about encouraging young people who were engaged in the political process in this election for the very first time. And the President made an effort to encourage young people who got engaged in the process not to be discouraged by the outcome. Everybody is discouraged when the candidate they're supporting loses an election. But the genius and brilliance of our democracy is that when the election is over, we recognize that we're Americans and patriots before we're Democrats and Republicans.\nAnd that is certainly a principle that President Obama and Secretary Clinton have forcefully advocated in the last 90 minutes or so. And I think that's part of the reason that so many people are proud of the campaign that Secretary Clinton ran, proud of the progress that has been made in this country under President Obama's leadership. And, frankly, it's why so many young people were and have been inspired over the course of President Obama's career in public life, but also in the context of Secretary Clinton's campaign for the presidency.\nSo if the outcome of this election encourages more people to be engaged in the important but difficult work of governing this country, that would be a really good thing. And I say that regardless of whether or not that young person who is mobilized to act is a Democrat or Republican. The President believes that our democracy benefits from more people being engaged and more people being involved in the debate, regardless of which candidate they support. Our democracy is strengthened when more voices and more perspectives and more views are incorporated into the process of governing this country. And the risk, really, --and this is what the President was sort of warning against -- is people being so discouraged that they choose to withdraw from that debate. The President is surely hopeful that that won't happen.\nQ: And one last piece. The President was at the microphone in the Rose Garden, he seemed hopeful, optimistic. But really, behind the scenes, what is his mood today?\nMR. EARNEST: I've had an opportunity to spend a little time with him this morning, and the mood that was on display in the Rose Garden is the mood that he was showing in private as well.\nLook, I'm not trying to convince you that he's not disappointed by the outcome. Everybody around here is disappointed by the outcome, but just as determined to continue their service to the American people. And that service demands that they focus on their institutional responsibility to ensure a smooth transition to the next President.\nThe President doesn't get to choose his successor; the American people do. And his responsibility to the American people and his responsibility to this democracy supersedes his own personal views, even on really important issues. And that's why the President has given clear direction to his team -- and these are directions that he actually gave at the beginning of this year -- to ensure that regardless of the outcome, that his team, that this White House was prepared to give the next President a running start.\nAnd President Obama is rooting for President-elect Trump's success in uniting and leading the country. It doesn't mean that he agrees with everything that President-elect Trump has promised to pursue. In fact, as he noted in the Rose Garden, and rather colorfully across the country at campaign events over the last few weeks, he's deeply concerned about some of the priorities that Mr. Trump laid out in the context of the campaign. But the demands of our democracy apply to everybody, including the President of the United States. And our democracy's success depends on a smooth transition of power, and that's a responsibility that President Obama and everybody here at the White House takes quite seriously.\nIsaac.\nQ: The President, campaigning against Donald Trump, spoke often about the existential threat that he thought that a Trump presidency would pose. Is he concerned for the future of the country and the future of the world, given that Donald Trump has been elected President?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Isaac, the President had used forceful language in helping people understand exactly why he was so passionate in his support for Secretary Clinton. And those are authentic views that haven't changed. That's not just rhetoric. Those aren't just slogans. Those represent the President's actual views and preferences about the direction that he'd like to see the country go. But that's not what the American people voted for.\nQ: Does he believe that nuclear war is more of a possibility now?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I'm not going to speculate on what sort of actions President-elect Trump may choose to prioritize or pursue. Obviously, he and his team are going to spend the next 73 days or so preparing themselves to lead the greatest country in the world. And part of what makes this country so extraordinary and so exceptional is that the United States has the greatest fighting force that the world has ever known. And that's not just a testament to our technological superiority; it's a testament to the brave and selfless Americans who are prepared to put their lives on the line to fight for this country. That's what makes our military so great.\nWe've also got a federal workforce, people who dedicate their lives to serving the public, that ensure that our air and water is clean, that ensure that even the youngest Americans can get access to a quality education, that are working hard to make sure that the American people who don't have access to health care can purchase it. These are talented, committed Americans who, after working to ensure the success of President Obama, will be just as passionate about ensuring the success of President Trump. They don't do that because either President necessarily reflects their personal political views; they pursue that work because they care deeply about serving this country, and they care deeply about the success of this country.\nAnd, in some ways, I think that's something that most people -- that's difficult to appreciate until you've had the opportunity to spend some time working in the federal government, and you see the people around you who don't get a lot of public glory, they don't get particularly large paychecks, but they feel a calling to serve.\nAnd President Obama often describes the U.S. government as the largest and most impactful organization in the world. And that is the organization that President-elect Trump will lead for the next four years.\nQ: Josh, not 48 hours ago, the President, in Philadelphia, warned of giving Donald Trump the nuclear codes. Is he concerned that Donald Trump now, as President-elect, will be getting the nuclear codes?\nMR. EARNEST: Isaac, what I can tell you is that the election is over and it's been decided. The American people have decided. President Obama doesn't get to choose his successor; the American people do that. And they've chosen somebody that President Obama disagrees with on a wide range of issues, and those disagreements in most cases aren't just minor disagreements, but rather profound disagreements. But that does not in any way detract from the President's determination to execute a smooth and effective transition of power.\nThat's what or democracy demands. The success of our democracy depends on it. And the President is certainly determined to live up to the very high standard that was set by President Bush eight years ago.\nQ: One last one. Is the President still doing the foreign trip that was scheduled?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes. I do not anticipate any changes to the President's foreign travel next week.\nJordan.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Donald Trump, during the campaign, pledged to jail Hillary Clinton, if she was elected, over the federal investigations that were underway. Some legal experts have said that President Obama could close off that opportunity if he pardons Hillary Clinton. Is that something that the President is considering doing?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Jordan, as you know, the President has offered clemency to a substantial number of Americans who were previously serving time in federal prisons, and we didn't talk in advance about the President's plans to offer clemency to any of those individuals. And it's because we don't talk about the President's thinking, particularly with respect to any specific cases that may apply to pardons or commutations.\nWhat I would direct your attention to, though, is the President's observation that he made in the Rose Garden about the tone that President-elect Trump displayed in his remarks last night. And that tone is consistent with the longstanding traditions of our democracy. And the President expressed hope that that kind of tone would continue. That's relevant because we've got a long tradition in this country of not -- of people in power not using the criminal justice system to exact political revenge. In fact, we go to great lengths to insulate our criminal justice system from partisan politics. And that commitment has served our country very well for more than two centuries, and the President is hopeful that it will continue.\nQ: Is he confident that it will continue, or just hopeful? Did he have a chance to talk about those issues with President-elect Trump?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not going to speculate about any -- about steps that President-elect Trump may choose to take. But the President expressed some optimism about the tone that President-elect Trump used when the eyes of the world were on him, when he spoke last night as the President-elect for the very first time. That was a momentous occasion, and his tone was notable. And hopefully it will continue in a way that is consistent with the kind of longstanding traditions and laws that have served a variety of Presidents in both parties very well for 240 years.\nChris.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. So, understanding that the President would not look kindly on any kind of pursuit of prosecution against Hillary Clinton, would you expect or is it possible that he would ask for assurances from Donald Trump that that was not going to happen?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have anything to preview in terms of their conversation. We'll try and get you a readout after that conversation occurs tomorrow, but I don't have any preview to offer at this point.\nQ: Other than sort of the nuts and bolts of a transition, can you give us any insights into what the President's priorities are tomorrow?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President's priorities tomorrow are to sit down with the President-elect and make clear that this administration's top priority for the next 73 days will be ensuring that the next President can get off to a running start.\nLook, this is not new. This is actually the third time in a row that a two-term President will be succeeded by a President for the other party who ran vowing to roll back key aspects of the incumbent President's agenda. So in 2000, you had then-Governor George W. Bush vowing to roll back the agenda of incumbent President Clinton. Fast-forward eight years, you had then-Senator Barack Obama running for President, successfully, vowing to roll back aspects of then-President Bush's agenda.\nAnd here we are, eight years later, facing a situation where the American people have elected a Republican -- President-elect Trump -- who ran on a platform of vowing to roll back key aspects of President Obama's agenda. But in each case, despite those vigorous disagreements, there was a commitment to the peaceful transfer of power that served the American people and our democracy very well. And President Obama continues to be committed to that principle.\nQ: There does seem to be a commitment, though, both on Donald Trump and many of his Republican supporters' side to get rid of the immigration reform that the President has put in the place, to get rid of the ACA, to go after the climate change agreement. So I know you said that you're going to pursue those policies accordingly, but was anything done in advance with the possibility, knowing that Donald Trump could be elected President -- were people looking at what could be done at all to, from your perspective, safeguard these things, move forward on these things, try to prevent, for example, the ACA from being repealed?\nMR. EARNEST: At each stage, since each of these policies was pursued, this administration has worked diligently to implement them as effectively and successfully as possible with an eye toward the long term. None of these policies that we've been pursuing were considered a stop-gap measure or somehow temporary in nature. The President pursued these policies because of the long-term benefits they have for the American people. And consistent with that view, we have worked very hard to implement them so that they'll be durable.\nAnd look, when it comes to the ACA, the ACA has withstood some significant challenges from Republicans in the past. We've had two Supreme Court cases. We've had 50 repeal votes. And in the face of all of that, the Affordable Care Act is still limiting the growth on health care costs, expanding access to health care coverage, providing consumer protections that guarantee some peace of mind for millions of Americans.\nIs it at risk again because the President-elect is vowing to repeal it? Yeah, it is again. But we've withstood some difficult challenges. That law has withstood some difficult challenges. And we'll see what the future holds. A lot of that will be up to the President-elect, but I think what we have found is that much of that will also require some kind of cooperation from Congress. And Republicans did hold onto majorities in both the House and the Senate, but they don't have 60 votes in the Senate, so it's going to require some bipartisanship in the Senate to advance some of this legislation.\nAnd the House of Representatives over the last couple of years has not exactly been the model of organization. That's an unruly place. And even people -- even members on the Republican side of the aisle have some deeply held and divergent views about the kinds of policies they should be pursuing.\nSo this is not going to be easy. But the bottom line is, everybody here at the White House is rooting for the success of President-elect Trump in his effort to unite and lead the country.\nQ: And if I could just ask you finally on that point, that obviously there's a lot of emotion involved here. There's a lot of people who worked on Hillary Clinton's campaign who are very well-known, and worked side-by-side here in the White House with the folks here. I think they believed, as the President does, that his legacy was at stake here. Can you give us a little insight into who the President spoke to this morning? Did he talk to the staff in general? Did he talk to small groups of people? And what was his overall message besides what we heard in the Rose Garden today?\nMR. EARNEST: The President has on a number of occasions now had an opportunity to address small groups of the staff. And the message that he's delivered to them in private is entirely consistent with the message that he delivered in the Rose Garden, with some special emphasis on the need for young people to remain engaged.\nChristi, you spent enough time around this White House now to know that a lot of the people who have spent the last two or three years here working at this White House are pretty young, and they've got -- if they choose to pursue it -- a bright future in politics. And President Obama wanted to deliver to them a very personal message that they should not be discouraged, that it's easy to sit back and by cynical, but, as you heard him say so many times on the campaign trail, he's going to choose hope, and he's hoping they'll choose hope, as well, even in the aftermath of a disappointing outcome.\nEven as I've been talking to my staff today, the other observation that I have made is that I've heard people often say that adversity builds character. I'm not sure that's true. I think adversity reveals character. And I think we've seen the kind of character that Secretary Clinton and Senator Kaine and President Obama are made of. And their example serves as an inspiration to me about the kind of character that I hope, even in this difficult time, that I can show. And I know I'm not the only staffer here at the White House who feels that way.\nKevin.\nQ: Can I ask you about Merrick Garland? Now that there won't be sort of the lame duck that I think many people predicted, what happens to his potential nomination? Has the President reached out to him at all?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know that President Obama has had an opportunity to speak with Chief Judge Garland today. The truth is our view of this situation has not changed. It's deeply discouraging how unfairly he has been treated by Republicans in the United States Senate who abdicated their basic responsibility to give him a hearing and a timely vote.\nSo we'll have to see what happens moving forward. But I can tell you that the intensity of the case that we will make in support of a candidate that has more experience on the federal bench than any other Supreme Court nominee in history, in support of a candidate that even Republicans acknowledge is somebody with a brilliant legal mind and somebody who represents the kind of consensus nominee that Republicans claimed they were hoping that President Obama would appoint.\nSo the outcome of this election certainly doesn't change the case that we will make about the necessity of the Congress considering his nomination, even though he's been waiting more than 200 days now.\nQ: Let me ask you, though, about the outcome of the election. I know it's been less than 24 hours, but as a guy who lived in Missouri, went to school in Texas, worked in Florida, you've been around parts of the country -- that obviously the Trump message resonated with the majority of the voters. What happened last night as best can you tell? And did you have to practice saying \"President-elect Trump\" -- President-elect Trump? Did you practice that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, you may be able to tell it doesn't come naturally.\nQ: No, it does not. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: But it's what the job requires, it's what our democracy requires, and it's what the American people expect. So I undertook the necessary preparation to try to deliver it as smoothly as I possibly could and with as much respect as I possibly could. Look, in terms of the results across the country, it's really hard to say.\nQ: But you've been in those places.\nMR. EARNEST: Yes.\nQ: You kind of have a -- you understand what the Missouri voter is like. You know what the Texas voter is like. You know what the Floridian is really like. And I'm just trying to figure out -- and again, granted, brevity of time won't give us sort of a full picture -- but can you understand why that message seemed to resonate with them at all?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, let me give you one example of a race that I followed closely in Missouri, in my home state of Missouri -- a fellow Kansas Citian by the name of Jason Kander ran for the United States Senate. He was a Democratic candidate. He had already won statewide in the state of Missouri previously when he served as Secretary of State, and he was widely praised for running a smart, tough campaign. And he was dogged, tireless in going door-to-door and making a case to people that, frankly, he anticipated and a lot of people anticipated would get the support of a lot of Missouri voters who weren't traditionally Democratic voters.\nAnd the thing that's hard to square about this election is -- I think the easy thing to say would be that Donald Trump performed so well in Missouri because voters in Missouri were pretty unhappy with what's going on in Washington, D.C. They're dissatisfied with the dysfunction. They're not seeing the kind of results from their elected representatives in Washington, D.C. that they would like to see, and they're sending a message by choosing somebody like President Trump to enter the White House and shake things up and make some changes.\nBut at the same time, a majority of Missouri voters also support Senator Blunt, who is somebody who is the -- spent a lot of time in Washington and spent time representing the people of Missouri in the United States House of Representatives, and has done the same thing in the United States Senate. So that would be -- it would appear that there's a bit of a mixed message there. And I think part of the optimism around Mr. Kander's campaign was around the idea that he could benefit from the same kind of anti-incumbent energy that was obviously propelling Mr. Trump's campaign. But that's not the way it turned out. It turned out that people apparently -- I haven't looked carefully at the results, but it certainly looks like you had a situation where people were motivated by their party identification and the party identification of the candidates more so than they were this sort of outsider, anti-establishment energy.\nSo I think in some ways that is a pretty good illustration of the complexity of discerning the motivation of voters across the country. But, listen, voters sent an important message, and it's important for people who are going to serve in the next administration and people who are going to serve in the next Congress, both in the House and the Senate, to spend some time thinking about what that message was, because it was a forceful one. And the American people are going to be expecting results, and what those results are is something that representatives in both parties are going to have to spend some time thinking about.\nMargaret.\nQ: Josh, the President campaigned so vigorously for Hillary Clinton on the trail, working this so hard. I know you can't read sentiment this early on, truly, and discern what the message was, but can you at least say why you think the White House's own internal predictions and readings were so wrong?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, it's not just our read of this that was wrong. Just about every public poll that we saw was wrong. You guys will check me on this because you guys follow this a little bit more closely than I did -- I'm not aware that any candidate campaigned in Wisconsin. And I think that's a clear indication that everybody, including both candidates, expected Secretary Clinton to win Wisconsin. And she didn't. And it's not close enough that anybody is calling for a recount.\nSo it is clear that nobody got the outcome that they expected last night. Now, does that mean that the polling industry has now been officially disrupted, or that political consultants are going to have to change the way they do business? Maybe. And that would be something interesting for them to consider over the next couple of years.\nBut I think it's just hard to tell exactly what the message was -- what the message from voters is. As I mentioned earlier, there are a substantial number of voters that voted for Barack Obama twice and then voted for Donald Trump yesterday. And given the vigorous opposition that President-elect Trump professed to have for the Obama agenda, it raises a lot of questions about why those voters supported him. And the answer to that is not obvious to me. Maybe it is to somebody else. And I suspect that political analysts and academics and political professionals are going to spend days and weeks and months and maybe even years digging into these results and trying to get greater clarity to explain the outcome.\nQ: Did this in some way -- I mean, the President -- you talked about some of the issues, but he used very stark terms, saying the very future of the Republic in a way is hinged on this election, that it's a defense of American values, really laying the stakes in very stark terms. So does he still believe that today, that the viability of the America he believes this country is, is at stake?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, as I mentioned earlier, the argument that the President was making on the campaign trail was an authentic one. It reflected his views. It wasn't just a slogan; it wasn't just a bumper sticker. He was making an argument that he deeply believes about the direction that he'd like to see the country go.\nQ: But he doesn't believe democracy is at risk? I mean, the future of the Republic -- he said that repeatedly in North Carolina and elsewhere.\nMR. EARNEST: The President made a forceful argument and he stands by that argument. But the time for making that argument is past. The American people rendered their judgment. And President Obama doesn't get to choose his successor; the American people do. And they did. And they didn't choose the person that President Obama supported. And so now the responsibility that President Obama has is to turn his attention to prioritizing a smooth transition of his successor and ensuring a peaceful transition of power.\nBut, frankly, the President's aspirations are higher than just a peaceful transition of power. He wants to make sure that we've got an effective transition that gives the next President the opportunity to get a running start. Because now that the election is over, it's a good time to remember that we're Americans first and all of us are rooting for the success of President Trump as he assumes the awesome responsibility of trying to unite and lead this country.\nQ: Can you tell us any color around how this happened last night? Who informed the President, how he spent his evening?\nMR. EARNEST: The President was monitoring returns from the Residence last night. I don't have a lot of details to share from there. Obviously he relied on staff to help coordinate the calls that he placed last night to Secretary Clinton and to President-elect Trump respectively. And he stayed up late in order to do that. He wasn't able to reach President-elect Trump until after President-elect Trump had delivered his remarks last night. So it was rather late. But obviously he had to work through staff in order to make that happen.\nQ: If the President goes on this trip, as you said -- or you said that schedule is not changing -- how is he going to explain to his allies what happened? I mean, the President, on mostly all of his recent foreign trips, has basically said he's confident that Hillary Clinton is going to win, none of what just transpired was going to happen. What is his message going to be? And it would seem to be redirecting what was going to be a farewell visit.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, the President spent a lot of time on his foreign travels over the last 12 to 18 months offering reassurance to our partners and allies around the world about the state of the political debate in this country and the likely outcome of the election. And now that we have an outcome of the election, I think the President will continue to offer reassurance to our closest allies and partners about the steadfast commitment of the United States to the kinds of alliances and partnerships that advance our interests and keep our country safe.\nMany of our strongest alliances are alliances that have been fortified by Democratic and Republican Presidents. And President Obama obviously invested a lot of his own time and attention to prioritizing investments in many of those alliances, particularly in the Asia Pacific. And President-elect Trump will chart a foreign policy path that he believes is in America's best interest. He will do so after getting the benefit of briefings from President Obama and from the national security experts in the Obama administration that have been implementing that policy and implementing that strategy.\nBut I think the reassurance that President Obama can offer to a lot of our allies is that, traditionally, and for generations, in some cases, our alliances have transcended individual Presidents and individual political parties in part because some of our alliances are rooted in the deep cultural ties between our two countries. But ultimately, it's going to be up to the President-elect to decide.\nCarol.\nQ: I want to go back to the President's rhetoric during the campaign. So you're saying that his comments about Donald Trump being unfit to be President of the United States and shouldn't have the nuclear codes, he's a genuine national security threat to the United States if he was elected -- you're basically saying the President still agrees with all of that, but the voters have spoken, so the sun came up and everybody should move on?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, I think what the President said in the Rose Garden is that our democracy demands -- the success of our democracy demands that the President put aside his own personal political views and his own preferences as he transitions out of office. The President doesn't choose his successor; the American people do. They have spoken.\nQ: A lot of people took what he said very seriously and therefore voted for Hillary Clinton based on some of these things that he said. And they're nervous, anxious. So what does he say to them?\nMR. EARNEST: He says to them that our -- the institutions of our democracy have been in place for 240 years, and our democracy has been buffeted by great challenge, some of which originated inside the United States, some of those challenges originated overseas. But by relying on our institutions and democratic traditions, demonstrating a faithful commitment to the will of the American people, our democracy hasn't just survived, it's thrived.\nAnd the President places great faith in the American people and in our longstanding democratic traditions and institutions. He places great faith in the people who make up those institutions -- whether that's the United States military, our men and women in law enforcement, the millions of American patriots that are civil servants that serve in our federal government. He also places great confidence in those Americans who don't work in government but are committed to moving this country forward.\nAnd that was the reference that he made in the Rose Garden to teachers that are responsible for educating the next generation of Americans. They don't get a lot of glory, they don't get big paychecks, but they are critical to the success of our country and our country's future strength. The same would apply to nurses all across the country. They don't get the glory, but they are doing the quiet work of striving to perfect our union.\nQ: At tomorrow's meeting, do you know, is Melania Trump also coming to meet with the First Lady, as is tradition? And any sense of what time this meeting will happen?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not aware of Mrs. Trump's travel plans. You'll have to check with her team.\nQ: Any sense of time?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have a sense of time yet, but we'll try and pin that down before the end of the day today so you guys can plan your day tomorrow.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, if the President puts aside the harsh criticism that he leveled against Trump during the campaign and welcomes him tomorrow, doesn't that put the meeting under an air of insincerity, bearing in mind what was said about him -- what Carol mentioned, the unfit and unqualified to be President and Commander-in-Chief?\nMR. EARNEST: No -- to be blunt. The President is quite sincere about fulfilling the basic responsibility that he has to the American people and our democracy to ensure a smooth transition to the next presidency. At the same time, Mark, the President has no desire or inclination to paper over the deep differences that the two of them have. The President acknowledged them in his remarks in the Rose Garden. And his expectation is that President-elect Trump is going to make the decisions that are consistent with his own policy views when he becomes President of the United States.\nAnd there's a strong chance that President Obama is going to disagree with at least some of those decisions, but the success of our democracy depends on everybody -- every single citizen -- including the President of the United States, setting aside their partisan affiliation, setting aside their political preferences, and rooting for the success of the American President as that person seeks to unite the country and move us forward.\nSo I'm not saying it's going to be an easy meeting, but the President is deeply sincere about fulfilling this responsibility. And look, I think it was also evident from hearing the President talk about this that President Obama entered office at a tumultuous time in our nation's history. We were in the depths of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. And his ability to mobilize an effective response that has spawned a historically strong recovery depended on him getting a running start. And that running start was only possible because of the commitment of President Bush and his team to this same principle of a smooth and effective transition.\nSo President Obama has experienced firsthand how a President benefits from the incumbent President devoting the time and energy that's necessary to help the incoming President get off to a running start. And President Obama is genuinely rooting for President-elect Trump to succeed in uniting the country and helping this country make additional progress. And that's a sincerely held view.\nQ: And despite what you said at the start, might you want to respond or comment on what Speaker Ryan said -- that the election was a repudiation of the liberal and progressive policies of this President?\nMR. EARNEST: I think there will be plenty of time for me to respond to statements like that in the days ahead. But in the spirit of today, we'll set that aside. But we can talk tomorrow. I've got some thoughts.\nMichelle.\nQ: What can you say about how much of the returns the President watched? How late was he up? Was he up all night? Who was he watching with? Was he with his family and staff? And what can you say about his reaction? I mean, during the campaign, you said that there was no comparison between these candidates, that there really wasn't a choice. But this is the choice that was made. I mean, surely he must have been stunned at some point.\nMR. EARNEST: President Obama did stay up late. It was not until after Mr. Trump -- President-elect Trump completed his remarks last night that President Obama was able to reach him on the telephone. So I know it was at least 3:30 a.m. or 4:00 a.m. before President Obama was able to turn in. I suspect the same is true of all of you. So he's not looking for any sympathy.\nQ: Was he with staff and family?\nMR. EARNEST: The President was in the residence. I don't know that there was any staff that was with him in person. He obviously was in communication with a number of staff members last night. And I don't know whether or not members of his family joined him as he was watching the results.\nQ: Okay, and his reaction to things going the way they did?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, I think you got a good sense of the President's reaction in the Rose Garden, which is the candidate that he was supporting didn't win and that's disappointing -- to him and to the 52 million other people who voted for Secretary Clinton.\nQ: So you're saying that at no point in the night was he surprised or had any other reaction other than an upbeat, let's move forward?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I don't think anybody -- and when I say I mean everybody got an outcome that we weren't expecting, that applies to the President, too.\nQ: Can you describe anything of his reaction along those lines, though? Because I think --\nMR. EARNEST: Look, it wasn't a positive surprise in his mind. He obviously was forcefully weighing in, in support of Secretary Clinton. And he felt strongly about this race. He made clear that there was a clear choice. But the President knew going into last night that once people started casting ballots on Election Day, his responsibility shifted from advocating for his preferred successor to planning for a smooth transition with whomever won the election.\nSo he was mindful from the beginning of his responsibilities to the country and to our democracy, in part because of his own personal experience of benefitting from that kind of planning that President Obama -- that President Bush initiated in 2008.\nQ: Do you know at what point he started to think, this is really going in the opposite direction than expected?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know at which point he reached that conclusion. I think that eventuality sort of dawned on everybody at some point probably relatively late in the evening last night.\nQ: Okay. And these comments have been brought up a couple of times now, but for both the President and other members of the administration to say during this campaign that the things that Donald Trump was saying were danger -- were actually dangerous to national security, and you said just today that there are real concerns -- so what are at the top of the President's concerns right now? For somebody to transition to someone that he actually called unfit and dangerous for national security?\nMR. EARNEST: Michelle, that is the rhetoric that you heard from the President on the campaign trail. That rhetoric reflects the President's views. It certainly reflects his own experience of having served in this job. And it reflects his own unique perspective on who is best qualified to succeed him. But the election is over. The election has been decided. And we live in a democracy. And that democracy means that the President doesn't choose his successor -- the American people do. And they did. And the President's responsibility as the outgoing President is to ensure a smooth and effective transition with the President-elect. And that is now the President's top priority. And that's one that previous Presidents have demonstrated. It's served our country and our citizens very well. And the President's expectation is that a commitment to those principles and a commitment to an effective transition will serve the country well this time, too.\nQ: That's exactly my question, though. I mean, you said that the time for argument is over. Well, that's right. This is now real. So if we are to believe, as you said we should, the President's concerns that this was a dangerous situation, surely the President must have some real concerns right now. And can you describe maybe the parameters of those concerns?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I want to be real clear about this. The election is over. There are going to continue to be debates in this country about the future of our country. There are going to be tough debates in Congress about the future of our country. There are going to be tough debates inside the Republican Party about the future of our country. There are going to be some tough debates inside the Democratic Party about the future of our country.\nSo the election is over. And you've seen Secretary Clinton and Senator Kaine offer up their gracious concession. And you heard President Obama graciously commit to a smooth transition, even with a candidate that he did not support -- in fact, one that he vehemently opposed. But that's what our democracy demands, and that is evidence of the durability and strength of our democracy. And it will serve the incoming President well. It will serve the incoming Congress well. It will serve our allies and partners around the world well. It will serve our economy well. And that's why the President has made this such a priority.\nQ: And our democracy also demands that, at some rare times, although most recently in 2000, the winner of the popular vote is not always the President. Does that make this more painful for the administration?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I can't speak for everybody, but it doesn't to me. Everybody knows the rules -- everybody knew what the rules were. And I think the outcome of the popular vote is an indication that Secretary Clinton's historic campaign succeeded in mobilizing tens of millions of Americans behind her vision and her candidacy. That is a credit to her.\nPresident Obama I think deserves a little credit for that too, given how aggressively he campaigned for her and given the kind of agenda that he also laid out. But no, everybody was aware of the fact that the next President is determined based on a count in the Electoral College, not a count of the popular vote.\nQ: Okay. And quickly, also during the campaign, he said many statements to the effect of this is not who America is; this is not what we stand for; I believe in the judgment and values of the American people that they will choose the candidate I support; and that America is not as divided as people say. Does he still believe those things that he said then?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what is true is that the President had an opportunity to convey his very well-known views about the two candidates on the campaign trail many, many times over the last several weeks. But he knew all along that what he was doing is advocating to the American people, trying to convince them to support his preferred candidate. And some 52 million of them did. But not enough to win the electoral vote, and that is our system of democracy. And it's not perfect, but it's a system that has served us very well.\nQ: But what I'm saying is, has this changed the President's view of who we are and what America is? If that's kind of the tone that he was taking.\nMR. EARNEST: No, I don't want to leave you with that impression. Obviously, the President disagrees with the outcome, and his preferred candidate didn't win. But, look, what it says about the voters and their motivation and their priorities -- again, I think people are going to spend weeks, months, if not years, trying to discern what this all means. But at the most basic level, what it means is that it means Donald Trump is the President-elect of the United States, and the responsibility of the sitting President is to make sure that President-elect Trump can hit the ground running when he enters the Oval Office.\nQ: At one point he told I think it was a group of black lawmakers that he would take it as a personal insult if Hillary Clinton was not elected and if great numbers didn't turn out. So does he take this as a personal insult?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, the feelings that the President was conveying in that speech to the CBC were authentic and they reflect his views. But the election is over, and the time for advocating for a specific candidate has come to an end. And the time for planning for a smooth, effective transition for the President-elect is now well underway. And that's a process that President Obama is deeply committed to.\nGardiner.\nQ: Josh, you've emphasized the smooth transition being important and you keep pointing back to the transition that happened between George W. Bush and Mr. Obama. But as far as I know, Mr. Bush never tried to lobby President Obama directly to maintain some of his policies. But you just told us that the President will have the opportunity to talk to the President-elect Trump about some of these policies. Are you suggesting that Mr. Obama is going to lobby Mr. Trump directly to maintain some of these policies that Mr. Trump has repeatedly excoriated on the campaign trail? And if that's not going to happen, doesn't that mean that the Iran deal, emission limits, immigration edicts, transgender bathrooms -- all those things are sort of gone on January 21st?\nMR. EARNEST: There's a lot there -- that's good.\nQ: Sorry.\nMR. EARNEST: That's okay. These are important questions. I think the first thing is, I can't speak to the nature of the conversations between President Bush and then President-elect Obama. I don't know if President Bush lobbied President Obama on any issues or not.\nI think what I would say in terms of trying to help you get a sense of the kinds of conversations I'm trying to describe, I wouldn't use the word \"lobby.\" I think what I would do is I would basically say the intent of President Obama and his team is to brief President-elect Trump and his team on these policies.\nQ: (Inaudible.)\nMR. EARNEST: Again, the point that I'm trying to make is this, is that -- and President Obama has acknowledged this -- that the view of certain policies once you're inside government gives you a new appreciation for the benefits of those policies. Am I suggesting that President Trump is going to reverse himself on a whole range of things that he's been campaigning on for more than a year and a half? No. I'm not trying to make that case, because I don't think that's true.\nBut what President Obama is hopeful of is -- well, what President Obama is committed to is an effective transition that helps bring President-elect Trump and his team up to speed on the current status of U.S. policy, including foreign policy. And there is a long tradition of Presidents, even Presidents in different parties, seeking to preserve some measure of continuity, particularly where those interests align.\nI wouldn't predict at this point how all that shakes out. The one thing that I would point out is that there are certain situations where the downside of unilaterally withdrawing from some of these international agreements is significant. So the consequences, for example, with the Iran deal, of pulling out, you do risk the Iranians trying to break out. At the same time, there's also a U.N. Security Council resolution that applies to this agreement -- that means that this agreement is something that's supported by our allies, but also by Russia. That, I think, could be a pretty good indication of how united the international community is behind this agreement. And President-elect Trump will have to decide what impact a sort of unilateral withdrawal would have on our relationship with countries around the world.\nBut, again, the American people have trusted him with the presidency. He will determine the course of our foreign policy and our national security, and he'll have to evaluate all of those things. My point is, is based on the existence of that U.N. Security Council resolution, based on the potential consequences of unilaterally withdrawing from that agreement, it's much more complicated than saying you're just going to tear the agreement up. It doesn't mean he won't do it. It just means that when briefed on all of these consequences, he'll have to take a close look at what policy he chooses to pursue.\nQ: But that assumes an optimism that your briefing can actually change his mind. And this is a man, Mr. Trump, whom the President has described for months as someone who is deliberately ignorant about much of what goes on in the federal government and doesn't seem interested, actually, in losing his ignorance about many of these issues. So you're suggesting a process here of the President educating the President-elect in a way that will get him to change his mind, but that defied the description that the President himself has given of Mr. Trump as someone who's willing to take counsel and change his mind.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, the President acknowledged in the Rose Garden that the tone that President-elect Trump displayed last night, at a moment when the world was watching, was markedly different than the tone that he typically adopted on the campaign trail. That's one small example. Does that apply to his policy positions? Who knows? But in the context of ensuring an effective transition, this administration is going to convey as much information as possible about U.S. policy and the benefits of that policy, and the consequences, positive and negative, for our pursuit of that policy.\nAnd ultimately it will be up to President-elect Trump to weigh all that information. Presumably, he'll rely on the advice of experts and advisors who have been supportive of his campaign, and maybe even some who haven't been, to ultimately make some of these decisions. But your example of the Iran deal is a good one, because there are significant and wide-ranging consequences that make it clear that it's not just as simple as some of the campaign rhetoric might make it seem. Does that change his decision? I have no idea. And if he does, I guess I'll be reading about it in the newspaper.\nChristi.\nQ: So, then, earlier when you said to Chris that this is not going to be easy, you weren't just talking about dismantling the Affordable Care Act, you were talking about the Obama legacy?\nMR. EARNEST: I think when I said -- at one point earlier, I did say it won't be easy, and I think I was referring to the meeting itself.\nQ: You were talking about trying to repeal Obamacare is not just as easy as decree --\nMR. EARNEST: I see. So that's a different example. Obviously, there's a role for Congress to weigh in on all of this. There's still a Republican majority in both the House and the Senate, which presumably would make that a little bit easier. But there are filibuster rules in the Senate that I know that Leader McConnell has previously expressed some significant passion for protecting. We'll see if he retains that passion moving forward. But that certainly would require some bipartisan cooperation.\nThe same is true -- well, there's a different situation in the House, which is that you all have well chronicled the deep divisions within the Republican Party in the House that make for a rather unruly majority. And it means that Speaker Ryan I think, in some cases, is going to have to look for some Democratic cooperation at least.\nAnd again, when you're on the campaign trail you say, well, this is a law I oppose, and I'm going to tear it up when I get in. But then you get into office and you realize, well, I'm going to need Congress's cooperation, and it turns out that we probably have to work in bipartisan fashion to get anything done in the Senate. Trying to organize the Republican conference in the House of Representatives is kind of a mess. All of a sudden it gets a lot harder. Does that change the outcome? I don't know. We'll have to see.\nMy point is, is that these are the kinds of the difficult questions that President-elect Trump will inherit, particularly when you consider the consequences of that decision, which include stripping health care from 20 or 22 million Americans, significantly increasing the deficit, significantly increasing health care costs, including for small businesses. So there are real-world consequence to deal with that often, in the context of campaign rhetoric, aren't accounted for.\nQ: So what I'm getting at is if people are tempted now to say the Obama legacy is toast, you would contend with that -- based on your analysis of the Obamacare repeal and what you just said to Gardiner about the Iran deal?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think it is far too early to tell exactly what kind of decisions President-elect Trump will make and what impact they will have on the priorities that President Obama has so proudly achieved. It certainly is not as positive a picture that I'd be painting if Secretary Clinton had emerged victorious. I'd feel a lot more confident because of the rhetoric that she used on the campaign trail about her commitment to pursuing many of the priorities that President Obama has been focused on.\nMr. Trump ran on a different platform. And what President Trump chooses to do with regard to those policies as he makes decisions is something that you can't fully analyze in the abstract. We'll have to -- as his presidency moves forward, you all will have an opportunity to evaluate what impact his decisions have had on the accomplishments that President Obama and his team are quite proud of.\nQ: So it's not as positive as if Hillary Clinton had been elected, but not as bleak as the President portrayed it last week?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think -- the President stands by the rhetoric that he used on the campaign trail, but the President has also, himself, in describing his own campaigning and his own governing, has noted that there's a significant difference between the two things. It doesn't mean that you fold on your principles. It doesn't mean that you're necessarily over-promising. It just means that they are two different things. And it's why there are all these open questions that only President-elect Trump can answer. And I don't know how many of them he'll try to answer on the first day, but you guys will just have to let me know.\nQ: Let me ask you this. You also said to Margaret that when the President is overseas he'll be trying to reassure allies and partners of the steadfast commitment. I mean, that's in question now, right? How can he do that, exactly?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, he can do that based on the longstanding tradition in our democracy of Democratic and Republican Presidents reinforcing our relationships around the world that advance our national interest. There's a Democratic and Republican tradition to strengthening our alliance with South Korea, for example. And what we have found is that our alliance with South Korea supersedes any individual presidency, it supersedes any individual political party, because we've seen multiple Presidents in both parties seek to strengthen that alliance.\nSo that would be, if you're looking for a reason to be hopeful about the future of the U.S.-South Korea alliance, that's what you would draw from, is the long history in this country of Presidents in both parties seeking to reinforce that alliance. Is that something that President-elect Trump will do? I don't know. We'll all find out.\nQ: So the President will be saying \"I hope,\" not \"I assure\"?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the President will say that there is a long tradition -- there is reason to be optimistic because we've seen Presidents in both parties pursue a strong alliance with South Korea. That's just the first example that popped into my head. I'm not singling them out for a specific reason. Are some of those leaders likely to say, well, Mr. Trump appears to be different than recent Republican Presidents? They wouldn't be wrong about that. So the President can offer some measure of reassurance, but ultimately the American people have chosen to give President-elect Trump the responsibility for figuring that out.\nQ: And just one quick logistical thing. Do you expect a news conference tomorrow?\nMR. EARNEST: Unclear at this point whether or not President Obama will take questions, but we'll keep you posted. At a minimum, you can certainly expect that the President will spend some time taking questions from all of you over the course his trip overseas next week.\nQ: And maybe tomorrow?\nMR. EARNEST: Maybe tomorrow. But we'll try and get you some clarity about that before the end of the day.\nQ: Any expectation that President-elect Trump would take questions?\nMR. EARNEST: You'd have to check with his team on that.\nToluse.\nQ: On the topic of reassuring world leaders, has the President actually reached out to any world leaders? Have any reached out to him since this result has been known? Since the President said earlier this year that different world leaders are rattled by Donald Trump's candidacy.\nMR. EARNEST: When I walked out here, which was some time ago now, I was not aware of any conversations that President Obama had had with foreign leaders at this point. But if there are calls like that that we can read out, we'll let you know. I can't speak to who has reached out to the White House or to the U.S. government since last night. I'll let those individual governments speak for themselves.\nAs Christi alluded to, on the course of President Obama's travels next week, he will have an opportunity to see the leaders of many of the countries with whom the United States has an important relationship. And we'll have more details about that trip in the next couple of days.\nQ: One of the countries that the President will be visiting is Peru. I wanted to ask about TPP. I think there was I guess an idea that the lame duck period would be focused on the President stumping for and campaigning for TPP both publicly and I guess with Congress. Given the fact that this election has repudiated the idea of trade with many nations, with Donald Trump's victory, has that changed? Is the President still going to stump for TPP the same way?\nMR. EARNEST: I guess, Toluse, the first observation I would have is that this is a question you'd be asking me regardless of the outcome of the election last night, because obviously Secretary Clinton's stated opposition to this has been well covered, as well.\nI think what I can say, in general -- well, the first thing I can tell you is that President Obama did have an opportunity earlier today to speak to Leader McConnell on the phone. The President is hopeful that he'll be able to connect with Speaker Ryan at some point relatively soon, and we'll let you know when that's occurred. And they did have a conversation about the outcome of the election, and President Obama did congratulate Leader McConnell on his success in retaining the title of Majority Leader in the United States Senate, and they had an opportunity to discuss some of the priorities for the lame duck session.\nI don't have a detailed readout to share, but President Obama does continue to believe that this is the best opportunity that the Congress has to take advantage of the benefits of a Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement that cuts taxes -- 18,000 taxes that other countries impose on American products. We've got a strong case to make with regard to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and we're going to encourage Republican leaders to take it up and pass it because of the enormous benefits that would accrue to American workers, American businesses, and the broader U.S. economy.\nGregory.\nQ: Has the President ordered that President Trump now receive the same full President's Daily Briefing that he himself receives every day?\nMR. EARNEST: Gregory, I can tell you that the Presidential Daily Briefing and other intelligence materials has been made available to President Trump -- President-elect Trump, Vice President-elect Pence, and a couple of designated members of his team. This is a courtesy that President Bush extended to President-elect Obama, Vice President-elect Biden, and a couple of designated members of their team. This is an important part of ensuring the kind of smooth transition that President Obama has prioritized.\nQ: And it's the same briefing that he himself receives?\nMR. EARNEST: I can't speak to the nature of the information that is presented, so I'd check with the DNI. But the idea here is that the President-elect and the Vice President-elect and some of their key national security advisors -- just a couple of designated officials -- can begin to get access to the kind of material that they will need to make important foreign policy decisions once President Trump takes office.\nQ: Following up on Jordan's question about pardons for Secretary Clinton, specifically, but also generally, the President was asked about this in August, about last-minute pardons, and he said that any last-minute pardons would have to go through the Office of Pardon Attorney, through the White House Counsel, through the regular process, and that all pardons would be based on merit and not political considerations. Does that guidance still stand? And wouldn't that preclude the President from giving a last-minute pardon to Secretary Clinton?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I remember when you had an opportunity to ask President Obama about this at the Pentagon earlier this summer. And the answer that President Obama gave you in that news conference still applies. I wouldn't speculate at this point about what impact that may have on hypothetical pardon requests that he receives. I'll just say that the guidance that President Obama shared with you is still operative.\nQ: And is the Cleveland Cavaliers event still on for tomorrow?\nMR. EARNEST: Absolutely.\nAndrew.\nQ: The President said he was encouraged by some of the things that he's heard from Donald Trump over the last couple of about 24 hours. Does the President have confidence that Donald Trump will respect the rule of law?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Andrew, I think at this point what President Obama is responding to is the tone that President-elect Trump displayed at his event last night. And the significance of that is that Mr. Trump had to make a conscious decision -- President-elect Trump had to make a conscious decision about the tone that he was going to use in speaking to not just to supporters in the ballroom, but also the millions of Americans watching on TV and the tens of millions of people watching around the world. It's a high-stakes moment. It was an opportunity for President-elect Trump to make an impression. And I'm confident that he was aware of that.\nAnd at that moment, he chose to adopt a tone that seems generally familiar to people who have been watching Presidents-elect at Election Night events. That would seem to suggest that certain basic principles of our democracy are likely to be upheld. Certainly one of those principles is ensuring that criminal investigations and our criminal justice system is not infected with partisan politics.\nThe question is, really, whether or not that tone will persist. And I'm sure that President Obama won't be the only one watching.\nQ: Do the results of the election alter the President's post-presidency plans? I mean, is he likely to remain more in the public eye after this than he would have otherwise done had Hillary Clinton won?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, again, the election results are barely 12 hours old. But in those 12 hours, I'm not aware of any change or reconsideration that the President has made about his post-presidency plans other than the likelihood that he probably is looking forward to his post-presidential vacation now more than ever.\nYes, ma'am.\nQ: Thank you. I'm correspondent from Afghanistan.\nMR. EARNEST: Nice to see you.\nQ: Thank you. I would like to ask you, how does the White House transfer the Afghanistan policy to the next President? Do you think that Afghanistan people or Afghan people should have a high expectation from the new President? Do you think that any change on the policy towards Afghanistan?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I will confess that I don't recall having heard President-elect Trump speak extensively about his view of U.S. policy toward Afghanistan. Some of your colleagues in the press corps here may have covered the debates or other events with Mr. Trump more closely and they can fill you in on that. But it's not clear to me exactly what sort of preferences or views he has articulated with regard to our policy toward Afghanistan.\nI would put this in the category of other important foreign policy decisions that the next President will have to make. And to ensure that he is effectively positioned to make a good, smart decision that's consistent with our national interest, President Obama and his national security team will ensure that President-elect Trump and his team have access to all of the information that's necessary to make future decisions about U.S. policy in that region of the world.\nThis is obviously the kind of decisions that the next President will make that will have a significant impact on our foreign policy and will have a significant impact on the thousands of U.S. servicemembers that are currently serving in Afghanistan and countering the threats that emanate from Afghanistan. So the stakes of that decision are high. The kind of decisions that have to be made in that environment are not obvious. But the next President will certainly benefit from the kind of informed, carefully considered advice from leaders in our military, leaders in our diplomatic corps, leaders in our intelligence community that have been very focused on U.S. policy in Afghanistan.\nJohn Decker.\nQ: Thanks a lot, Josh. The President today in the Rose Garden praised the transition model that was put forward by former President George W. Bush, said that's the transition model that he'd like to follow. As it relates to not only President George W. Bush's post-presidency model, but also Bill Clinton's post-presidency model, George H.W. Bush's post-presidency model, they've refrained from criticizing their successors. Would President Obama also follow that same model -- refrain from criticizing President Trump and his policies once President Obama is a former President?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, I don't think I can say anything declarative about that question. Presumably that's something that between now and January 20th you or one of your colleagues could ask him. I think what I can tell you is that I've heard him say -- and I believe he said this in public -- he has appreciated how, particularly early in his presidency, former President George W. Bush was not a regular, active, public presence, offering his critique of the new President.\nAnd President Obama believes that that was not just beneficial to his ability to run the country and make difficult decisions; I think it also reveals the character of our 43rd President. Surely, I'm confident in saying that President George W. Bush did not agree with every decision that President Obama made in his first year or two in office. But he kept his disagreements to himself. And I know that President Obama has appreciated President Bush taking that step to give the incoming President the running room necessary to make decisions, to advocate them for them publicly in a way that would have been much more difficult if the recently departed President was critiquing his every move.\nQ: I wanted to ask about the relationship -- it's an unusual relationship, in a way, that President Obama has had with the President-elect. I say that because early on in the President's tenure as President, as you may recall, the President-elect questioned the citizenship of President Obama.\nMR. EARNEST: I do recall that.\nQ: And then a short time after that, the President famously went after, you could say, the President-elect at a Correspondents' Dinner, brought a lot of laughter. I realize that --\nMR. EARNEST: From almost everybody in the room. (Laughter.)\nQ: -- I realize that the election is so fresh, but has the President had time to be introspective in the sense that the person that he's had this unusual type of relationship -- from afar, essentially -- is now succeeding him as President?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it's not news to observe that President-elect Trump and President Obama have deep, longstanding, and public disagreements on a wide range of issues, including with regard to some of the tactics and rhetoric that the President-elect used on the campaign trail. The President was quite outspoken about that in the context of this election.\nBut the election is over. The American people made a decision. President Obama didn't get to choose his successor; the American people did. And President Obama's responsibility now is to ensure that the incoming President, no matter how significant their disagreements, can get off to a running start. And President Obama, including in his capacity as a former President, will genuinely be rooting for President Trump's success in uniting and leading this country.\nQ: Have President Obama and President-elect Donald Trump actually met fact-to-face before, or will this be their very first meeting?\nMR. EARNEST: I believe that they had one other opportunity where they were at a public event together. Off the top of my head, I don't remember where that was, but I feel like they may have had one. But I guess what I would say is this: They do not have an extensive personal relationship. (Laughter.) This is not a situation where they've had many conversations or played golf together or any of that business. So I guess that will be among the many, many, many reasons that tomorrow's meeting will be rather interesting. Okay?\nChris, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I think there's a lot of fear among LGBT people and others who've seen progress under the Obama administration, like Muslims and immigrants, that they'll face persecution under President Trump. What is President Obama's message to them?\nMR. EARNEST: President Obama's message to them is that our country has benefited from a steadfast commitment to a set of democratic institutions, and these institutions have been durable even through a civil war, through a couple of world wars, through financial calamities. And the President has enormous confidence and faith in those institutions, in part because those institutions are made up of patriotic Americans. That's true whether we're talking about public servants who are employees of the federal government or the brave men and women of our armed forces. Those institutions serve the American people well, and it's important for our leaders to demonstrate faith in them and to rely on them. That faith in those institutions has served very well some of our country's greatest Presidents.\nThe other observation that President Obama would make -- and he did so in the Rose Garden -- is that progress in our country hasn't moved along a straight line, and progress that we make in some of these areas is characterized by two steps forward and one step back. Sometimes it's characterized by delayed progress. The observation that President Obama would make is that the best response to that is not to lose hope or to be cynical or to withdraw from the public discourse. It actually calls for greater engagement. It calls for more people who passionately and strongly about these issues to stand up for what they believe in.\nSecretary Clinton, I think, put it best: It's worth fighting for what's right. She's certainly done that throughout her three-decade career in public life. And it's something that President Obama has certainly done not just while he's held elective office but even before he entered elective office and that's a -- I think it should be -- well, let me say it this way: I think Secretary Clinton intended that as very good advice for people who may be feeling discouraged today.\nAnd it's understandable that people are feeling discouraged because it's natural that you're going to be disappointed when the candidate that you supported in the election doesn't win. But even the losing candidate in this case does not think that that should be used as an excuse to withdraw from the public debate and public discourse. If anything, it should serve as a motivation to become even more deeply engaged and more deeply involved, and not just in a presidential election.\nQ: And I have a variation on the firewall question. Many of these advancements for LGBT people and others are the result of executive action undertaken by the President. Is there anything the White House can do to protect them in the next administration?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I won't speculate at this point about what President-elect Trump may or may not do. Every time the President has initiated a decision or made a policy decision or taken an executive action, he's done so with a long-term perspective. His approach to policy-making has been to be cognizant of the long-term implications of the decisions that he's making, and it means that he is making these decisions with the assumption that the decisions will be durable, that they'll be in place for some time, and that benefits that the American people will enjoy as a result of those decisions will be present for a long time.\nSo that's been approach since his first day in office. But ultimately the approach that President-elect Trump takes is one that he alone will determine.\nThanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 3:00 P.M EDT", "timestamp": "2016-11-09", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}

{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "The President spoke at 12:20 p.m. in the Rose Garden at the White House.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119611", "text": "The President. Good afternoon, everybody. Yesterday, before votes were tallied, I shot a video that some of you may have seen in which I said to the American people: Regardless of which side you were on in the election, regardless of whether your candidate won or lost, the Sun would come up in the morning.\nAnd that is one bit of prognosticating that actually came true. The Sun is up. And I know everybody had a long night. I did as well. I had a chance to talk to President-elect Trump last night—about 3:30 in the morning, I think it was—to congratulate him on winning the election. And I had a chance to invite him to come to the White House tomorrow to talk about making sure that there is a successful transition between our Presidencies.\nNow, it is no secret that the President-elect and I have some pretty significant differences. But remember, 8 years ago, President Bush and I had some pretty significant differences. But President Bush's team could not have been more professional or more gracious in making sure we had a smooth transition so that we could hit the ground running. And one thing you realize quickly in this job is that the Presidency—and the Vice Presidency—is bigger than any of us.\nSo I have instructed my team to follow the example that President Bush's team set 8 years ago and work as hard as we can to make sure that this is a successful transition for the President-elect, because we are now all rooting for his success in uniting and leading the country. The peaceful transition of power is one of the hallmarks of our democracy. And over the next few months, we are going to show that to the world.\nI also had a chance last night to speak with Secretary Clinton, and I just had a chance to hear her remarks. I could not be prouder of her. She has lived an extraordinary life of public service. She was a great First Lady. She was an outstanding Senator for the State of New York. And she could not have been a better Secretary of State. I'm proud of her. A lot of Americans look up to her. Her candidacy and nomination was historic and sends a message to our daughters all across the country that they can achieve at the highest levels of politics. And I am absolutely confident that she and President Clinton will continue to do great work for people here in the United States and all around the world.\nNow, everybody is sad when their side loses an election. But the day after, we have to remember that we're actually all on one team. This is an intramural scrimmage. We're not Democrats first. We're not Republicans first. We are Americans first. We're patriots first. We all want what's best for this country. That's what I heard in Mr. Trump's remarks last night. That's what I heard when I spoke to him directly. And I was heartened by that. That's what the country needs: a sense of unity; a sense of inclusion; a respect for our institutions, our way of life, rule of law; and a respect for each other. I hope that he maintains that spirit throughout this transition, and I certainly hope that's how his Presidency has a chance to begin.\nI also told my team today to keep their heads up, because the remarkable work that they have done day in, day out—often without a lot of fanfare, often with a lot of attention—work in agencies, work in obscure areas of policy that make Government run better and make it more responsive and make it more efficient and make it more service friendly so that it's actually helping more people, that remarkable work has left the next President with a stronger, better country than the one that existed 8 years ago.\nSo win or lose in this election, that was always our mission. That was our mission from day one. And everyone on my team should be extraordinarily proud of everything that they have done, and so should all the Americans that I've had a chance to meet all across this country who do the hard work of building on that progress every single day: teachers in schools; doctors in ER clinic; small businesses putting their all into starting something up, making sure they're treating their employees well; all the important work that's done by moms and dads and families and congregations in every State—the work of perfecting this Union.\nSo this was a long and hard-fought campaign. A lot of our fellow Americans are exultant today. A lot of Americans are less so. But that's the nature of campaigns. That's the nature of democracy. It is hard and sometimes contentious and noisy, and it's not always inspiring.\nBut to the young people who got into politics for the first time and may be disappointed by the results, I just want you to know, you have to stay encouraged. Don't get cynical. Don't ever think you can't make a difference. As Secretary Clinton said this morning, fighting for what is right is worth it.\nSometimes, you lose an argument. Sometimes, you lose an election. The path that this country has taken has never been a straight line. We zig and zag, and sometimes, we move in ways that some people think is forward and others think is moving back. And that's okay. I've lost elections before. Joe hasn't. [Laughter] But you know—[laughter].\n[At this point, Vice President Joe Biden made the sign of the cross.]\nThe President. So I've been sort of——\nVice President Biden. Remember, you beat me badly. [Laughter]\nThe President. That's the way politics works sometimes. We try really hard to persuade people that we're right. And then, people vote. And then, if we lose, we learn from our mistakes, we do some reflection, we lick our wounds, we brush ourselves off, we get back in the arena. We go at it. We try even harder the next time.\nThe point, though, is, is that we all go forward, with a presumption of good faith in our fellow citizens, because that presumption of good faith is essential to a vibrant and functioning democracy. That's how this country has moved forward for 240 years. It's how we've pushed boundaries and promoted freedom around the world. That's how we've expanded the rights of our founding to reach all of our citizens. It's how we have come this far.\nAnd that's why I'm confident that this incredible journey that we're on as Americans will go on. And I am looking forward to doing everything that I can to make sure that the next President is successful in that. I have said before, I think of this job as being a relay runner. You take the baton, you run your best race, and hopefully, by the time you hand it off, you're a little further ahead; you've made a little progress. And I can say that we've done that, and I want to make sure that handoff is well executed, because ultimately, we're all on the same team.\nAll right?

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119553", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:18 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Nice to see you all, including some familiar faces. (Laughter.) I do not have any announcements at the top so we can go straight to your questions.\nJosh, do you want to start?\nQ: Sure. Thanks, Josh. The President described -- I should clarify, President Obama described his meeting with President-elect Donald Trump as \"excellent.\" I was wondering if you could tell us if there was anything specific that President-elect Trump told the President about how he plans to govern this country that led to President Obama's characterization of it that way.\nQ: Well, Josh, I had an opportunity shortly before coming out here to visit briefly with President Obama about the meeting -- and there are many details of their discussions that they'll keep between the two of them. A couple of things that I can share with you -- obviously, the President indicated during the pool spray that they had an opportunity to discuss some foreign policy and some domestic issues.\nSome of those foreign policy issues came up in the context of the President's upcoming trip overseas. The President described to the President-elect some of the issues that he expects to come up with some of our allies and partners and other world leaders that he'll meet with on the trip, and so it was an opportunity for them to talk about some of those issues in advance of the President's trip and in advance of some of the conversations that he expects to have with world leaders on the trip.\nThere also was an opportunity for the two leaders to talk about staffing and organizing a White House. That's complicated business. And any White House is expected to be structured in a way to deal with multiple challenges, or even multiple crises at the same time. And the President-elect indicated a lot of interest in understanding the strategy of staffing and organizing a White House. And obviously that's something that President Obama has thought about extensively during his eight years in office, and they spent a large portion of the meeting discussing the importance of properly staffing up and organizing a White House operation.\nBut, look, other than that, what the President heard from the President-elect is a clear commitment to the kind of effective, smooth transition that President Obama has been vowing to preside over for the better part of a year. And the President intends to make good on that promise in the 70 days ahead.\nQ: Did the President leave the meeting any more reassured that President-elect Trump will not try to dismantle all of the work that you and your colleagues have done over the last eight years? And did President Obama make any pitch to Trump, for instance, not to get rid of Obamacare or other significant policies?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, I'm not going to get into all the details of their meeting. I think that President Obama came away from the meeting with renewed confidence in the commitment of the President-elect to engage in an effective, smooth transition. That obviously is what President Obama believes serves the American people the best. We are committed to doing what is required on our part to make sure that that happens. And the President was pleased to hear a similar commitment expressed by the President-elect.\nQ: Do you know if the President got any reassurances from Trump about whether he plans to pursue what he discussed during the campaign about trying to incarcerate Hillary Clinton?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I'll let the President-elect sort of read out his end of the conversation. But as I mentioned yesterday, the President found reassuring the kind of tone that the President-elect conveyed in his election night remarks.\nAs I mentioned yesterday, these were remarks that the President-elect delivered not just to his supporters in the ballroom, but to the citizens of the country that were tuned into this historic election, but also to people around the world. And given the intensity of scrutiny of his remarks, it's notable that he chose that kind of tone. I think we saw a similar tone just in the Oval Office 30 minutes ago, where he was indicating his commitment to working closely with the outgoing administration to ensure a smooth, effective transition.\nThat doesn't mean they don't agree on all the issues. They obviously have deep disagreements. But what they do agree on is a commitment to a smooth and effective transition, and that's a good thing for the country.\nQ: President-elect Trump talked about looking forward to receiving President Obama's counsel in the future and meeting more times. Did they agree to meet again? Were there -- something put in place where they're expected to continue the conversation they had in an additional format?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any additional meeting that's been scheduled, but I wouldn't rule out future consultations. Obviously, when President Obama served -- over the last eight years, President Obama has benefitted from the kinds of conversations that he's been able to have with previous Presidents. And I wasn't surprised to hear that President-elect Trump indicated that he feels like he would benefit from those conversations over the course of his presidency as well.\nRoberta.\nQ: Was it awkward at all? Given all the rancor that the two men exchanged versus each other on the campaign trail and even before that, was the meeting awkward at all in terms of getting past that? Was there a moment where they had to sort of break the ice and get past that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, to be as specific as possible about this, Roberta, there was no staff in the room when President Obama and President-elect Trump sat down in the Oval Office for 90 minutes. So I think that's probably a question you'd have to ask the two of them.\nI feel confident in telling you that they did not resolve all their differences. I also feel confident in telling you that they didn't try to resolve all their differences. What they sought to do was to lay the foundation for an effective transition from the Obama presidency to the Trump presidency. And this administration, at the direction of President Obama, has been preparing for this moment and this meeting for the better part of a year.\nAnd this obviously was an important early step, having the President sit down with the President-elect to discuss that transition. And based on the kind of agreement that was evident about the priority that they both place on a smooth transition, it sounds like the meeting might have been at least a little less awkward than some might have expected.\nQ: And you said that it was just the two of them alone, there was no staff in there?\nMR. EARNEST: That's correct.\nQ: For the entire time?\nMR. EARNEST: That's correct.\nQ: And the pool waiting to go into the Oval had seen some other officials, Denis McDonough among them, on the South Lawn. I'm just wondering if you could tell us a little bit about what other officials from the White House may have met with -- who was in those sort of discussions going on at the same time.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I know that the President's-elect spokeswoman, Ms. Hicks, was here. I had an opportunity to meet with her -- to meet her, I guess I should say -- while the President-elect was meeting with President Obama. You noted that -- she also had longer meetings with some other members of -- some of my colleagues in the communications team. You noted that Mr. Kushner was here and had an opportunity to visit with the Chief of Staff.\nThose are the only staffers from the President's-elect team that I had an opportunity to meet today. There may have been some others that were with him, but I can't speak to all of the meetings that took place.\nI will just clarify that there is a more formal process that we would expect would guide the interactions between the President's team and the President's-elect team for the two months between now and the inauguration. There will be a formal process for that kind of consultation to ensure a smooth transition. The kinds of conversations today were much more informal in nature.\nQ: President-elect Trump mentioned that he learned about some high-flying assets, and I'm just wondering if you know what he was referring to when he talked of that.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not sure what he was referring to, but you can check with his team on that.\nMichelle.\nQ: So you're saying as far as \"excellent\" goes, he's talking about a smooth transition and having a good tone -- I mean, that's all that \"excellent\" means?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think when you consider the profound differences between the two gentlemen, when you consider the fact that they have never met before in person, and when you consider the high priority that the President places on a smooth and effective transition, I think that qualifies as excellent.\nQ: I mean, Donald Trump mentioned that this was originally supposed to only last 10 to 15 minutes. Is that true? And why would it go on so much longer than that?\nMR. EARNEST: The President had allotted more time on his schedule for that meeting than just 10 to 15 minutes. But they did end up spending about 90 minutes, talking about a range of issues, including what I described to Josh earlier, and I think that would be an indication of a pretty robust, valuable meeting.\nQ: So yesterday you talked about the President still having deep concerns, obviously, and that everything he said on the campaign trail about Donald Trump was true. This meeting -- I mean, considering all of that, it was a brief meeting -- did it do anything to assuage any of those deep concerns?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, as I mentioned yesterday, the President campaigned vigorously across the country making a forceful case in favor of the candidate that he supported. And he did that right up to the night before Election Day. But on Election Day, the ballots were counted and the American people decided. The President was never in a position to choose a successor; the American people chose the successor. The President vowed to work with whomever the American people chose.\nSo, no, they did not recreate some sort of presidential debate in the Oval Office today. They were focused on doing the work of the American people, fulfilling their institutional responsibilities. And on President Obama's part, that means laying the groundwork so that the incoming President-elect can hit the ground running. After all, as President Obama said in the Rose Garden yesterday, we're all rooting for his success when it comes to uniting and leading this country.\nQ: So the President still has his deep concerns, then, is what you're saying?\nMR. EARNEST: What I'm saying is that the forceful case that the President made on the campaign trail leading up to Election Day reflected his authentic views about the stakes of the election and about the candidate that he went all in to support.\nQ: Obviously there was nothing in this meeting that would change any of that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess what I'm saying is that the meeting was not convened to try to resolve the variety of concerns that President Obama had raised on the campaign trail. The meeting was focused on the transition, and it went well.\nQ: Okay. And given that some of Trump's advisors have, just prior to this meeting, talked about looking for all of the ways -- or wanting a list of all of the ways that they could roll President Obama's policies back, starting on day one, does the President fully expect that to happen?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I'm not going to prejudge what their transition process is. Obviously, our goal is to make sure that the incoming President-elect can hit the ground running and can enjoy success when it comes to uniting and leading the country. That's what the President promised yesterday. Convening a meeting in the Oval Office today is part of making good on that promise. How they choose to use the time and what priorities they choose to set for the earliest days of the Trump presidency is something that you'll have to ask them.\nQ: What does the President expect to happen now?\nMR. EARNEST: I think the President's expectation is that the incoming President will set his own priorities and pursue them accordingly. And again, our goal is to provide him the kind of advice that would give the President-elect and his team the opportunity to succeed in uniting and leading the country. That's what he has indicated that he has made his priority, and we certainly are prepared to do everything we can over the next 71 days to support him in that effort.\nQ: Well, does the President now have any reason to believe that Donald Trump is fit to be President of the United States?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, the two men did not re-litigate their differences in the Oval Office. And we talked about them quite a bit in here leading up to the election, and we're on to the next phase now.\nJustin.\nQ: You mentioned a formal process, so I guess I wanted to ask if there are meetings that have either occurred or are being set up with senior staff here at the White House since Donald Trump won the presidency, especially national security or economic teams going forward?\nMR. EARNEST: My understanding, Justin, is that the broader formal process has not yet commenced with meetings. There were a number of meetings between White House personnel and members of both candidates' transition teams in the months leading up to the election. And I know there have been a number of consultations with the President's-elect team and the White House team. But the formal meetings I don't believe have started just yet.\nQ: I wanted to ask about, I guess, press access today. The meeting with the Vice President and Vice President-elect Pence was closed press, which is a break from past precedent. And Carol reported that the Obamas cancelled a photo op.\nMR. EARNEST: That's not true.\nQ: Okay. Can you talk about, then, why we didn't have a photo op in the way that we had them in previous administrations, and why there's no press access, and particularly if this is --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, first of all, Justin, you just were in the Oval Office with the President of the United States and the President-elect, so it's not accurate to say that there was no press access. But let's just be clear about what's happened.\nOver the last eight years, I've enjoyed the opportunity to have many of you in my office over the years advocating for greater access to the President and the work that he's doing in the Oval Office. And what that typically means is you coming in and advocating for the opportunity to see the President of the United States sitting in the Oval Office, photograph him sitting next to the person that he's meeting with, and then hear from both people about the meeting. That's the priority that has been conveyed to me in countless meetings with all of you over the last eight years.\nThat is exactly what was provided today. That was not provided in 2008. I wasn't part of designing the press access for 2008, so I can't account for all of the reasons for that. But the press access that we put together today was based on the guidance that we've received from all of you over the last eight years about what the priority is. And we were pleased to be in a position to provide that today.\nIt is an indication of the commitment that we have to transparency, and it is an indication that the President has to building public confidence in the shared commitment to a smooth and effective transition. What better way for the American public to understand that the President and the outgoing President of the United States share a priority of a smooth and effective transition than to allow you all into the Oval Office to hear them talk about their commitment to that effort.\nQ: And one way to demonstrate that you guys are committed to the, I guess, effective transfer of power would be to show the Vice President or show the First Lady welcoming their successors into the White House.\nMR. EARNEST: But I think we would all just agree that that would be lower in priority than what was provided today. And what was provided today is unprecedented in terms of the kind of access that was granted to previous White House press corps.\nSo, look, there's always going to be this back-and-forth. As I've stated before --\nQ: Josh, the reason that this is relevant, and the reason that I'm asking the question is, while the President has come out and sort of put on a cheery face, we know obviously many here are disappointed. The First Lady spoke passionately about how she found Donald Trump to be an unacceptable choice. So are we to read anything -- or even putting aside whether we should read anything, is the reason that there wasn't press access to either of those events because the First Lady or Vice President didn't want to be photographed or appear alongside --\nMR. EARNEST: Absolutely not. In fact, I am not aware that the First Lady's office was consulted about the press arrangements for today. I certainly didn't consult with them.\nWhat we can do is we can go back to the White House photographer and see if there are any photos from the greet so that you all can get some insight into how that went. So we'll follow up with you on that.\nQ: Last one. A number of foreign governments from top allies of the United States -- Turkey, the United Kingdom, Canada, Mexico -- have all said that their leaders have been in communication with President-elect Trump over the last 24, 48 hours. Beyond sort of congratulatory calls, is there a concern among you guys, as you're trying to pursue your foreign policy agenda over the next two months -- that allies could be getting mixed messages on the U.S. -- the United States' foreign policy goals?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware of any concern about that. It is not uncommon for countries that have important relationships with the United States for them to call and offer their congratulations to the President-elect. Some of those conversations are facilitated by the State Department. In other cases, you've got foreign governments that are going directly to the President-elect's office. And that's consistent with past practice, and I'm confident that that happened in 2008 after President Obama's election as well.\nOlivier.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. First, I'm kind of curious about the President as HR professional. Does he say, you need to get a great Chief of Staff? Does he say, there's this one job you never, ever heard of, but it's vital? Or is it just -- obviously, Donald Trump knows he's got to staff the White House. So how much precision is the President offering in his recommendations?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'll be honest, I didn't have a detailed conversation with President Obama about this. But knowing how he has approached these issues himself, I think that he has built an organization at the White House with an eye toward surrounding himself with capable people and putting them in positions where they are given the authority that they need to make decisions. Also he's ensured that they are given the authority that they need to elevate decisions to him if they need to be. So structuring the organizational chart effectively is not an insignificant matter when you're talking about life and death decisions that have to be made on a regular basis in this building.\nThe President will be taking some questions over the course of the next week, and maybe somebody can seek greater insight from him on that.\nQ: And looking overseas to the operations against the Islamic State, the President recently sent 1,700 more American troops there. You've long insisted that they don't have a combat mission. These are combat troops. Why did they go? I mean, are you saying that they needed 1,700 more American troops' worth of advice and assistance? I mean, we're starting to see some social media of Americans who look like they are in front-line operations, not in supportive ones.\nMR. EARNEST: Olivier, what we've made clear is that our servicemembers, when they go to Iraq, they are trained for combat, they are equipped for combat because they need to defend themselves in a dangerous country, but they are not given a combat mission. And that is an important distinction, because the President does not believe that American troops should be in a situation in which they are expected to be at the tip of the spear to go and take and hold ground. The idea of the U.S. military being an occupying force in Iraq is not one that has yielded success for our country. It's not made our country safer.\nSo what the President envisioned and the mission that they have been given is a dangerous one. It's one in which American servicemembers are asked to assume great risk so that they can be in a position to, in some cases, train Iraqi security forces; in other cases, so that they can offer advice and assistance as Iraqi security forces undertake important military objectives. There are even some situations where if some of those trainers or advisors end up in a dangerous position, then there are additional U.S. forces that are mobilized to get them out. This is dangerous work. And this does put them in harm's way. And it does put them in a situation where, occasionally, they have to use their combat training and their combat equipment to defend themselves.\nBut that is much different than being in a situation in which they are asked to take and hold territory. That's a different strategy and it's a different mission. Both of them are dangerous. Both of them require courage and professionalism and skill and sacrifice. And that's what we have seen from our men and women in uniform.\nQ: I get your point about occupying, but the kinds of troops you're sending now are actually the kinds of troops that take ground and hold it, at least briefly.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I recognize that the servicemembers that President Obama has sent to Iraq do have extraordinary combat capabilities. They've got extensive training. They've got the kind of combat equipment that you would see in a theater of war that you would expect our servicemembers to have when they're operating in a dangerous place. But the mission that they have been given is different than the mission that they were given by President Bush that involved occupying a foreign country. That didn't work out well. And President Obama believes that we need to try a different strategy, and that different strategy is yielding important success.\nIn Iraq alone we've already taken back more than 50 percent of the occupied populated territory that ISIL previously held. Now, with the support of these advisors and trainers and other U.S. forces that are offering assistance, Iraqi security forces have isolated Mosul and are beginning the important, painstaking work of ejecting ISIL from Mosul. So we're making progress, based on the strategy that the President has put forward. This is a strategy that requires our servicemembers to assume great personal risk. But it is a strategy that is yielding progress and making America safer.\nJon.\nQ: Josh, what is the President's message to the thousands and thousands of people across the country protesting this election? Some of them carrying signs saying \"Not my President.\"\nMR. EARNEST: Jon, I think the first thing the President would say is that we've got a carefully, constitutionally protected right to free speech, and the President believes that that is a right that should be protected. It is a right that should be exercised without violence. And there are people who are disappointed in the outcome. And the President's message in the Rose Garden was it's not surprising that people are disappointed in the outcome, but it's important for us to remember, a day or two after the election, that we're Democrats and Republicans, but we're Americans and patriots first.\nAnd that's the message that the President hopes that most people will hear. But are there some people who are going to be disappointed, and are they going to express those views in public? I think we've seen that that's the case. They have constitutional rights to do that, and those rights should be protected. But the President would obviously want them to hear his message as well.\nQ: Given that all that's been said, were you surprised to see Donald Trump or hear Donald Trump say that the President is a \"very good man\" who he respects?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, I think the kind of tone that we heard from the President-elect in the Oval Office today is consistent with the kind of tone that he used in his remarks on Election Night. And that's the kind of tone that you heard President Obama welcome in the Rose Garden. And it certainly is something that the President was pleased to hear.\nQ: He did say he would seek the President's counsel and there would be many, many more meetings. Is President Obama open to meeting again with President Trump, including after he -- when he becomes President Trump?\nMR. EARNEST: Of course. Look, the President has benefitted from the kind of consultation that he's had with former Presidents. And President Obama is determined, as he mentioned yesterday, to do as much as possible to ensure that President Trump can have some success in uniting and leading this country. As President Obama himself said, he's rooting for his success as he takes on the important work of uniting the country after a divisive election, and leading our country forward in a way that's consistent with the best interests of many generations of Americans.\nQ: And I know you said they didn't re-litigate the campaign, but I just want to ask you what the President's thoughts are. he said just on Monday that Donald Trump is \"temperamentally\" -- he said on Monday, \"Donald Trump is temperamentally unfit to be Commander-in-Chief,\" \"uniquely unqualified.\" Does he still believe that?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, the President's views haven't changed. He stands by what he said on the campaign trail. He had an opportunity to make his argument. He made that argument vigorously. He made that argument in states all across the country. But the American people decided. The election is over. The President didn't get to choose his successor; the American people did. And they've chosen President-elect Trump. And President Obama is determined to preside over a transition that gives the incoming President the opportunity to get a running start.\nMajor.\nQ: Pick up on Justin's line of questioning -- the President assured President-elect Trump that he would do everything he can to make a swift and sure transition. Did he ask of President-elect Trump to have his backing for anything he may do on foreign policy while he's still President? Get assurances from him that there would be no criticism either through back channels or publicly of what he's still trying to accomplish while he retains the power of the presidency?\nMR. EARNEST: I didn't ask the President if he sought that kind of assurance from the President-elect so I can't say for sure what was discussed in the Oval Office.\nThe thing that I am sure of is that everybody understands that we've got one President at a time. And President Obama is President of the United States until January 20th, and he will exercise the authorities of the office consistent with his view about what's in the best interest of the country. On January 20th, it will be the President's-elect turn to assume that awesome responsibility.\nQ: And there's no anxiety on the part of the President that the President-elect doesn't understand or appreciate that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I think you'd have to talk to the President's-elect team about whether or not he would object to the principle that I've just laid out.\nQ: Okay. The Russian government said today that there were contacts between it and the Trump campaign and the Clinton campaign during the course of the campaign. Does the White House find any reason at all to be concerned about that, or would that fall under the category of normal embassy communications with two campaigns of which -- one of which may become the next President of the United States?\nMR. EARNEST: I can't speak to the nature of those conversations, obviously, so it's hard to judge them in the abstract.\nQ: -- the conversation that went on during the campaign, does this raise any higher level of anxiety or alarm?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, what I know based on my own personal experience is I know that there were -- when President Obama was running for President that there were occasions where members of his team did consult with representatives of other governments. I don't think there's anything inherently nefarious about that. But, again, I can't speak to the content of the conversations that may have occurred, so I don't think I can pass judgment one way or the other. But I don't think there's anything inherently nefarious about it.\nQ: The President-elect mentioned that some difficulties on the foreign policy stage were discussed. Did the President go into that meeting wanting to convey anything in particular about what's going on in Mosul, what's going on in Iraq, and perhaps convey some information that the President-elect might either not be aware of or not sufficiently appreciate? Because I don't need to tell you, Josh, in the last two weeks or longer, the President-elect was describing what was going on in Mosul as something approaching an abject disaster, which I know is not your interpretation or the Pentagon's interpretation.\nMR. EARNEST: Right.\nQ: Did the President feel obligated or go into this, wanting to say, well, here's some stuff you might want to know because you're going to inherit where this is come January 20th?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President did feel obligated to touch on some important foreign policy priorities, and I know that the ongoing campaign against ISIL in Iraq, and in Syria, for that matter, are important foreign policy priorities. I don't know to what extent that was discussed, but this is obviously something that President Obama is following closely.\nQ: Thanks, Josh.\nMR. EARNEST: Ron.\nQ: You said that the President stands by everything that he said on the campaign trail about Donald Trump, the President-elect.\nMR. EARNEST: That's right.\nQ: Then he must -- the President must be very concerned about the future of the country.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, the President, right now, is concerned on the most important institutional priority that he has right now, which is presiding over a smooth and effective transition.\nQ: But again, if he still feels this way about the President-elect, he must be concerned about the future of the country beyond this transition.\nMR. EARNEST: Look, Ron, the President had an opportunity to make a very forceful case in public in states all across the country in support of the candidate that he endorsed. The American people chose someone else. And he's committed to working with that person, the person that he did not support, to ensure a smooth and effective transition.\nThere is a long tradition in our democracy of Presidents effectively doing that because they have a responsibility to put their own political views aside and perform the functions of the presidency. And one of those functions is to ensure a peaceful, smooth and effective transition, because America is going to do its best when its Presidents are performing at its best. And President Obama is determined to do everything that he can to allow the President-elect and his team to hit the ground running.\nQ: I think I understand that. But the question is, after this transition, what does the President intend to do to -- is he going to become something of an opposition figure? Is he -- he's got to be concerned about the direction the President-elect has said he's going to take the country.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think as all of you have heard, the President's plans to take a long vacation after he leaves office have not changed. And I assure you that he's looking forward to that as much as ever. But over the longer term, I don't have any commitments to make on the part of the President.\nOne thing that I can share with you is something that I've heard him say I know in private -- I assume that he said this in public, too -- which is just the idea that he deeply appreciated how President George W. Bush, after leaving office, gave the new President some running room, gave him a little space, wasn't backseat-driving in public, offering up all kinds of critiques with every single decision that President Obama was making in the earliest days of his presidency. I'm confident that President George W. Bush didn't agree with every single decision that President Obama was making, but he was extraordinarily respectful of the democratic process. President Obama admired that.\nBut, look, I can't make any promises now for what exactly President Obama will do once he leaves office.\nQ: During the next seventy-some-odd days, is there a strategy that the White House has, that the President has, to try and preserve and protect certain aspects of what he has accomplished here? What are the priorities?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the first priority is ensuring the smooth and effective transition. But there's also the priority that the President places on making sure, as the Chief of Staff likes to say, that we run through the tape; that the President and his team use every moment that's remaining to do the work of the American people and to effectively implement the kinds of policies that President Obama has prioritized over the course of his presidency.\nQ: What are some of those priorities now? Given the change in administration, given the fact that Donald Trump has won the presidency, what specifically is the focus? What are the priorities?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't know that I can give a comprehensive list, but some of the priorities that come to mind are the kinds of priorities that actually would be in place regardless of the outcome of the election. Whether or not Mr. Trump had emerged victorious from the election, we would be focused on the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and maximizing the opportunity that currently is available to millions of Americans to go to HealthCare.gov during the open enrollment period and sign up for health care. For those individuals that already have health care, they have an opportunity to go to HealthCare.gov and shop around. Many of them will find that there actually is a comparable health care plan available that will cost them less money.\nSo making that a priority is something that we would do regardless of who had won the election. But that certainly is a very high priority right now.\nObviously, when it comes to counterterrorism and homeland security, that's always a priority. That was true before the election and that certainly is true after the election. And we certainly wouldn't want any of our adversaries to be confused about the fact that America might somehow be uniquely vulnerable in the midst of this transition. That's not true. This administration is strong, and our homeland security efforts are as vigorous as they've ever been. And we're going to continue that effort.\nYou made reference -- or someone made reference to -- or Major made reference to the ongoing work against ISIL in Iraq and in Syria. The United States is leading a coalition with 67 partners to degrade and ultimately destroy that terrorist organization. There are some consequential decisions that have been made recently by leaders on the ground both in Iraq and in Syria to focus on the significance of the strategic objective of defeating ISIL in their two declared capitals in Iraq and in Syria. And that effort is underway. That's dangerous business. But it's a high priority, and it stands -- if successful, stands to advance our objectives and make the American people safer.\nSo those are three priorities. Those are at the top of everybody's mind around here. And the truth is that would be the case regardless of the outcome of the election.\nQ: And just lastly, this was the first time these two men met.\nMR. EARNEST: That's correct.\nQ: There's that old clichй, first impressions are a lot. What was his first impression of Donald Trump?\nMR. EARNEST: I didn't ask him that question before I came out here. So, again, maybe when the President takes questions you guys will have an opportunity to ask him about that. But we'll keep you posted on that.\nBut, look, the overriding impression -- I don't know if it was the first one -- but the overriding impression is his positive assessment about the commitment of the President-elect to a smooth and effective transition by our teams working together. That's going to maximize the likelihood that we'll achieve that objective.\nCarol.\nQ: Donald Trump's advisor on Israel said today that the President-elect doesn't view settlements as an obstacle to peace, which is obviously a different position than the President has. And the President had been looking at perhaps doing something on this issue before he leaves office, just to put it in a different place than it is now, on a trajectory to -- so eventually the next President can be able to have talks. Is he considering doing something like that still? Or is he of the view that at this point, when you have a President-elect taking steps like that when you have such big, wide disagreements it's not the proper thing to do?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, my first reaction is that the concern that you've heard President Obama express about the expansion of settlements is not just the policy of this administration, it was actually the policy of previous Democratic and Republican administrations who expressed concerns about that. The view is that trying to change facts on the ground only puts a negotiated settlement, a resolution of differences between the two parties farther away. So the President views that kind of continued settlement expansion as counterproductive. And again, that's consistent with the policy that Democratic and Republican Presidents have expressed.\nMore generally, I don't have anything to preview with regard to any additional steps that President Obama may consider before leaving office. The principle that we have articulated is that it is really important for the Israelis and Palestinians to sit down in the context of face-to-face negotiations and resolve their differences. And President Obama has expended enormous effort -- Secretary Kerry has probably expended more effort than anybody else -- to try to bring those sides together. And thus far, those efforts have not yielded the kind of progress that we'd like to see. But our belief that that's the only way that those differences will be resolved continues to be true.\nQ: What about the broader -- does the President have a philosophy on just that issue? When you have a President and a President-elect who differ so much on significant foreign policy issues, does he believe that now is the time to not take steps that would be at odds with what the next President might want to do for Guantanamo Bay, for instance, or other things? What's his general view on that?\nMR. EARNEST: His general view, Carol, is -- again, and I think this is the view of outgoing Presidents in both parties -- which is that there is one President at a time. And President Obama has the authority of the office of President until January 20th, and he will make decisions consistent with his view about the best way to advance the interests of the country.\nIn the afternoon of January 20th, that awesome responsibility will be transferred to the President-elect, and then he will be given that awesome responsibility. And in this interim transition period, what President Obama has committed to is doing our best to coordinate and communicate with the President-elect's team. But when it comes to exercising that authority, that authority rests solely with President Obama, until January 20th.\nApril.\nQ: Josh, a couple of questions. One, did you get any kind of readout from the First Lady's office about her meeting with soon-to-be First Lady Melania Trump?\nMR. EARNEST: I did hear from them. The First Lady hosted Mrs. Trump in the private residence of the White House for some tea and a tour of the private residence. Part of that tour included stepping out onto the Truman Balcony. I think all of you have heard both the President and First Lady talked about the quality of time that they've spent on the Truman Balcony, and Mrs. Obama took the opportunity to show it off to Mrs. Trump.\nThere also was an opportunity for the two women to walk through the State Floor of the White House with the White House Curator, Bill Allman. And some of you have had an opportunity to visit with Mr. Allman. He is essentially a walking encyclopedia of knowledge about everything at the White House. And so Mrs. Trump had an opportunity to hear from him. They also had a discussion about raising kids at the White House. And obviously the First Lady's two daughters spent the formative years of their childhood here at the White House, and Mrs. Trump's son will also spend some important years of his childhood here at the White House. And that's a rather unique childhood. And the two of them had an opportunity to talk about that experience and being a good parent from that experience.\nAnd then after their tour concluded, the First Lady and Mrs. Trump walked over to the Oval Office, and the two couples visited again before they departed.\nQ: So the First Lady and Mrs. Trump walked over there after the press left?\nMR. EARNEST: That's correct, yes.\nQ: And then the next thing -- going back to Justin and the historic pictures of the transition, I recall when George W. Bush was President-elect, and then-President Bill Clinton walked him down the Colonnade to the Oval Office, and press were there. I remember years ago, when George W. Bush and Mrs. Bush -- Laura Bush -- then-First Lady Laura Bush greeted the then-President-elect, Barack Obama, at the Diplomatic Room door. And they also did the walk.\nWhat happened? I mean, I understand you said you wanted us to see them more -- you wanted to give us more access. But the precedent has already been set for those kind of walks and pictures to happen. What happened this --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we went over and above the precedent by providing access to the Oval Office. You and I have talked about this many times over the last eight years, that the priority that you place is getting access to the Oval Office and hearing directly from the President and the person that he's meeting with about the meeting that just occurred.\nThat didn't happen in 2000, when President Clinton welcomed President-elect George W. Bush to the White House. That didn't happen in 2008, when President Bush welcomed President-elect Obama to the White House. I'm not criticizing the two previous administrations or the two previous White Houses; I'm merely stating that the access that was provided by this White House is entirely consistent with the kind of requests that we've been fielding from all of you over the last eight years.\nQ: And just -- I hate to beat this to death, but just understanding that initial picture of the initial meeting, on the arrival, to see the body language -- a picture speaks a thousand words. The first glances, the first moments speak a thousand words. And that's what we missed. And I guess that's what we're talking -- I guess that's what we're talking about.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I understand that. We'll consult with the White House photographer and see if there are any photos that he was able to capture of that moment and share them with all of you. And it certainly is not just your right, but your responsibility to advocate for more access, and I respect that.\nQ: Lastly, can you give us the construct of what it looks like when a former President counsels a current President? I know that Bill Clinton counseled George W. Bush and, as you said, that this President has taken the counsel of other Presidents. What are some of the issues that he's received counsel on? And what does that look like, if you can tell us that?\nMR. EARNEST: We've gone to great lengths to keep that kind of consultation private. That consultation between Presidents and former Presidents is private. And there's a special bond that people who have assumed this awesome responsibility of leading the greatest country in the world have. And so they have unique and sensitive conversations that we just can't provide much insight into other than to tell you that they have occurred not just with Presidents in the same parties -- President Obama didn't just consult with President Clinton, but has had useful, warm, supportive conversations on a variety of topics with Presidents in both parties.\nAnd I guess the best example I could give you would be of President George H.W. Bush. You've heard the President I believe speak in the past about how much he's valued those kinds of interactions. And I don't want to leave you with the impression that they've had dozens of phone conversations in the last eight years, but on those opportunities that President Obama has had to visit with President George H.W. Bush, Bush 41, the President has come away with enormous respect for his service to the country and for his wisdom about what's required to lead the country.\nSo that's just one example. And obviously, the relationship between President Obama and President Clinton is one that benefitted President Obama enormously. And over the last several years, you all have seen firsthand the kind of relationship that exists between President George W. Bush and Laura Bush and the President and First Lady.\nSo these kinds of relationships are important. And if that extends into the next presidency, President Obama is committed to doing his part to trying to provide the kind of counsel that he's benefitted from over the course of his presidency.\nQ: Okay, you say a variety -- he's talked to Presidents -- former Presidents on a variety of topics. Is it domestic policy, or foreign policy, or just the history of it all when it comes to certain issues?\nMR. EARNEST: It's both. Some of it's dealing with the demands of the office. These are the kinds of things that are part and parcel of a conversation between somebody who is bearing an enormous burden and somebody who has dedicated a significant portion of their previous life to fulfilling the same task.\nQ: And he would be open to doing -- when he is President, when is number 45, he would be open to do it at any moment? Donald Trump?\nMR. EARNEST: As I mentioned -- and I guess I would say this principle applies not just during the transition, but even after -- that President Obama believes that -- well, President Obama will be rooting for the President-elect to succeed in uniting the country and in moving our country forward.\nChristi.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. First you said that you met with Hope Hicks, and then you said you met her. Did you --\nMR. EARNEST: So Ms. Hicks had an opportunity to actually have a meeting with my colleagues, Jennifer Psaki and Liz Allen, the Communications Director and Deputy Communications Director here at the White House. While she was in that meeting, I had an opportunity to go and introduce myself and visit with her just briefly.\nQ: So did you guys have a chance to talk about what it's like to do your job, or --\nMR. EARNEST: No, I did not have that conversation with her. But I will certainly have that conversation with the person that the President-elect selects to succeed me once he's made that decision. But I didn't have that conversation with Ms. Hicks and I don't have a sense of who the President-elect may have in mind.\nQ: And also, I asked you this yesterday, but maybe you know a little bit more today, about what the President's message will be to foreign leaders when he goes overseas.\nMR. EARNEST: I didn't have a detailed conversation with him about that. The President was interested in making sure that the President-elect was aware of the kinds of conversations that are scheduled over the course of the next week. But foreign leaders understand the same principle that I described earlier, which is that President Obama will be President of the United States through January 20th and he will exercise all of the authorities of that office until then.\nBut in this transition period, the President is interested in making sure that the incoming President has insight into the kinds of conversations and issues that he will inherit on the afternoon of January 20th.\nQ: So will he be reflecting to those foreign leaders any of his impressions of his -- of the President-elect based on today's conversations?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I wouldn't preview the conversations at this point. But after those conversations have occurred, we'll do our best to read those out to you and give you a sense of how those kinds of conversations -- I will just affirm that I'm confident that this will be a subject of the discussion that he has with every world leader when he travels next week.\nQ: Yesterday you said that the President would reassure allies and partners of the steadfast U.S. commitment. Does he still plan to do that?\nMR. EARNEST: The President will offer his reassurance to our allies that the -- historically, the United States of America, even across political parties, has been committed to not just upholding but also seeking to strengthen the alliances that we have with countries around the world. The view of Democratic and Republican Presidents has been that the robust health of those alliances makes America safer. And Presidents in both parties have been committed to investing in those alliances, and that certainly is what's happened in the past.\nI'll let the President-elect and his team discuss what their plans are for some of those alliances, but certainly our allies should understand President Obama's view and should understand the history -- the longstanding history in this country about the way that we not just maintain but actually advance our alliances around the world.\nJulie.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Just following up on that, first of all, is that a case that he made to -- the President made to Donald Trump during their Oval Office meeting when he talked about how the trip would unfold? Did he talk about the importance of valuing these alliances, and not withdrawing from them, and honoring what the tradition has been on that front?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know how detailed a conversation they had about the priority that President Obama places on our alliances. I know that the President was interested in ensuring that the President-elect was aware of the conversations that were scheduled, and the President wanted to give him some insight into the kinds of issues that he expected would come up in those conversations. But more than that, I don't have much more insight into their conversation I can share.\nQ: Just more broadly -- during the campaign, the President spoke often about how serious of a job the presidency is, what it's like to sit in the Oval Office and make decisions, and criticized Mr. Trump for, in his view, not having that kind of approach that was needed to be President. Did he give him any advice during this meeting? Did he talk to him about that issue and how he needed to step up, or anything he needed to do differently in order to succeed in the job that he has now?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the fact that they spent so much time discussing the organization of the White House I think should be an indication that the President-elect takes seriously the important responsibility that he's been given. And I think that's also -- I think that's something that we can also conclude based on the kind of tone that we've heard from the President-elect in the two statements that he's delivered since the outcome of the election was announced. But I think more generally you'd have to talk to the President-elect for his view on this topic.\nQ: There's organization and human resources and personnel, and then there's how you comport yourself, and whether you take seriously the office of the presidency, which is something that the President has said in the past he doesn't believe that Mr. Trump is capable of. Did he give him any advice or pointers on how he might --\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not sure if they discussed this specific topic or not.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Can you just -- you may have touched on this -- is it true that the President-elect is now receiving the two daily intelligence briefings over the transition?\nMR. EARNEST: What I can tell you is that the intelligence community has made those briefings available. I don't know whether the President-elect, the Vice President-elect, and their national security designees have actually received the briefing. You can check with them about that, though.\nQ: Let me ask you about Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act. Is it the President's position that Americans who currently take advantage of the Affordable Care Act needn't be worried about its demise upon the ascension into the office by President-elect Trump?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, first of all, we've got some good news on the Affordable Care Act today. Yesterday was the highest -- or I guess I should say the best day of the open enrollment period thus far. Yesterday, more than 100,000 people selected plans at healthcare.gov. That's an indication of the intense demand for the kinds of insurance offerings that are available to people at healthcare.gov. So that's an indication of the success of the program when you consider the intense demand that people have for these services and for these opportunities that aren't available other places, and are only available because of the Affordable Care Act.\nThat said, the President himself has acknowledged that there are some things that we could do to strengthen the program further. Things like expanding access to tax credits that would reduce health care costs for more Americans. In some cases, if we got more states to expand Medicaid -- again, this is providing health insurance to low-income Americans, paid for almost entirely by the federal government -- doing so would put downward pressure on the premiums paid by everybody. That would be a good outcome. And certainly finding ways to overcome the politically motivated objections of Republicans who have blocked Medicaid expansion in their states would be good for the law.\nQ: Absolutely. But I guess what I'm getting is, are those who are using Obamacare whistling past the graveyard, knowing that the President-elect will have the Congress and the power to essentially repeal it?\nMR. EARNEST: No, they're not, because these are benefits that are available to them today. And we certainly would encourage people to sign up and capitalize on the good opportunity that's there. For the vast majority of people who do sign up, more than 7 in 10 of them will be able to sign up for a health care plan for $75 a month or less.\nQ: So you're saying, I'm not concerned in any way, and you're telling the American people, you shouldn't be concerned in any way that Obamacare, the benefits that you receive under Obamacare will be going away anytime soon?\nMR. EARNEST: What I'm saying is that the President-elect is going to make his own decisions. And worries about those future decisions should not have any impact on anybody capitalizing on the opportunities that are available to them today at healthcare.gov.\nQ: Let me ask about the Electoral College. There's been some sort of conversation -- we certainly heard this said in 2000 -- some have said, well, one person received the majority of the votes, maybe it's time to do away with it. Usually you get that from the side that lost. What's the President's view of the Electoral College? Is it time to give it a fresh look?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I am not aware of any constitutional reform proposal that the President has put forward. But, look, this is our system and this is a system that has been in place for a long time. Everybody knew the rules before the race started, and everybody campaigned accordingly. There's a reason that the candidates and their surrogates spent so much time in states like Florida and North Carolina, where those were states that have a lot of electoral votes and where the polls indicated that the race was going to be very close. So everybody executed a strategy consistent with their knowledge of the rules. Nobody changed the rules at the end.\nAs has often been discussed, a reform proposal like the one that you're hinting at would have a pretty significant impact on the strategy that people put forward. It would encourage candidates to actually spend more time -- or, at least, it would provide an incentive for some candidates to spend more time in those communities where they know they have the most supporters. So you can imagine Democratic candidates spending more time doing rallies in places like Northern California and New York City, where Republicans, on the other hand, might spend more time in places like New Orleans and Dallas to try to drive up the turnout and maximize the kind of turnout from their supporters.\nSo there are consequences for putting forward those kinds of reforms and there are some pros and cons. But, look, the fact that Secretary Clinton won the popular vote on Tuesday is indicative of the strong support across the country for her candidacy, for the agenda that she put forward. And the President is hopeful that 58, 59 million Americans who got involved and were engaged in support of her campaign don't linger too long on the disappointment about the loss of their candidate and will actually seize the opportunity to remain engaged in our political debate our country will benefit from.\nQ: I know you don't have any scheduling updates at the moment about the President may be talking about TPP on the Hill. Is it time that he continued to get over there and maybe rally the troops and see if something can get done here in the lame duck?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, the President did have a conversation with Leader McConnell yesterday, and I know that he's been working to schedule a conversation with Speaker Ryan. I don't know that that's occurred yet, but we'll keep you posted on that. But certainly the President and his team are in touch with leaders in both parties on Capitol Hill about the important work that needs to get done before the end of this year.\nQ: Do you have a count?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm sorry?\nQ: Do you have a count?\nMR. EARNEST: Not one that I've seen publicly, but you can check with the vote counters on Capitol Hill about that.\nQ: Last one -- Gitmo. I ask you pretty much weekly. I think the number is less than 60 now, according to my last update. Any readout on the possibility that that number will be dropping below, say, 50 in the next week or two?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have any predictions at this point. But obviously we're continuing to do the important diplomatic work of transferring those individuals that had been determined by a review board that they can be safely transferred under a set of restrictions to other countries. I don't have any upcoming transfers to preview, but I can confirm for you that if any transfers are made, we will announce them publicly.\nSarah.\nQ: Josh, the First Lady took a little bit of an unprecedented role on the campaign trail this last cycle. Does she see herself in having a role in sort of projecting this sort of smooth transition of power attitude?\nMR. EARNEST: She doesn't have any sort of vested constitutional responsibility that relate to a transition. I think what you saw today was a gesture of hospitality to the incoming First Lady. Mrs. Obama has talked before publicly about the stresses and anxieties of moving to a new place, living inside a fishbowl, living inside a museum, and raising your family there. And I'm sure that Mrs. Trump is feeling many of those same anxieties as she prepares to move herself and her family into the White House. And so the courtesy that Mrs. Obama extended is rooted in her own experience of going through this difficult transition.\nQ: And I'm just a little confused -- when you and the President say that you hope Donald Trump is successful, given that the President has said that he sees Trump as having the potential to undermine democracy, undermine American ideals, wouldn't it be fair to say that you don't want him to be successful?\nMR. EARNEST: That's a good question, Sarah. The point that I made -- and I tried to be precise about this -- is that the President's view is that our country benefits when we have a President who succeeds in helping the American people understand our collective interests. And that's why the President has talked about his hope that President Trump will succeed in uniting the country.\nThere are some profound political differences that were revealed by this election, and our country will be better served if we can try to bridge that gap. It doesn't mean we're going to agree on everything. And it doesn't mean that President Obama is now endorsing every policy proposal that the President-elect vows to pursue. Their differences remain. Their differences are profound. But our country succeeds and our country does best when we have a President who is succeeding in uniting and leading the country. And that's what the President is hopeful for. And the President -- the current President is going to do his part to try to give the incoming President every advantage as he seeks to do that. And that is, after all, the message that we heard from President-elect Trump on Election Night.\nQ: Did the birther issue come up at all during their meeting? (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware that it did. I'm not aware that it did.\nGeorge.\nQ: Thanks. Speaking of the fishbowl, as the new team looks to name its press secretary and communications director, what advice would you give them generally on press relations and, specifically, on pools?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me just stipulate that I'm not sure they're going to be that interested in all that much advice from me. And that's okay. I stand ready to provide whatever advice is sought. The first thing I'd tell them is that you guys are a bunch of softies. (Laughter.) I wouldn't say that. Unfortunately, that's not true.\nWhat I would tell them is that they have a responsibility to communicate with the White House Press Corps. The White House Press Corps has a critically important, constitutionally protected function to hold people in power accountable. And that's something that you and your news organizations devote significant time and resources to.\nThere's also a lot of expertise in this room. There are a lot of people in here who have covered many different White Houses, and that historical perspective is something that benefits your ability to describe to the American people just what's happening here.\nAnd I guess the last thing -- there are a lot of other things I would say to them. The last thing I'll say to you about what I would say to them is that it's hard to read things in the media that are critical of you. It's hard to read things in the press that are critical of things that you deeply believe in and that you've been working day and night to advance. And so there's a natural tendency I think to recoil and to write off people who disagree with you as people who are not worth talking to. And that is a natural human tendency and temptation.\nAnd my advice to the incoming team would be to not give into that temptation; that the kinds of conversations that I've had with all of you -- everybody who is sitting in this room has, on many occasions, written things or broadcast things about the White House that I didn't agree with, that I didn't think were fair, that I didn't reflect -- thought reflect the kinds of priorities that we've established or accurately reflect what we're trying to do. But those stories never got better by ignoring your emails or ignoring your phone calls, or telling you that you're not allowed to come in my office anymore.\nThat's never happened. The way to try to change your view or to try to influence your reporting is to make a case to you on the merits. And you can't do that if you won't pick up the phone, and you can't do that if you won't return an email.\nAnd so that's the philosophy that we have pursued here. I'm sure there will be plenty of people who will say that -- on your side who will say that we didn't do that enough, or maybe that we did it too much, and we're open to that kind of second-guessing. But that's the strategy that we have pursued. I think that strategy has served President Obama well, but, most importantly, I think that strategy has served the American people well for helping them understand what we're doing here.\nAfter all, if you believe as deeply and as strongly as I do about what we're doing, then you should be interested in having an opportunity to make that case to the American public, because it's likely to persuade people. And that's the approach that we've taken, and I think the President and the American people have been well served by it.\nQ: And on the pools?\nMR. EARNEST: On the pools, look, having a pool of reporters follow you around everywhere you go is inconvenient, occasionally annoying, and takes a long time to get used to. But it serves an important purpose. And this White House has gone to great lengths to coordinate with all of you as you organize that effort, and I would recommend that the incoming administration do the same.\nAlexis.\nQ: Josh, can I just ask two quick follow-ups and one question? In response to your answer to Major's question, you may remember that in the transition from George W. Bush to Barack Obama, the Commander-in-Chief briefing -- or talking to the incoming Commander-in-Chief had three things on his mind, classified things that he wanted to personally brief incoming President Obama on. Did President Obama today use this opportunity to do something similar with President-elect Trump, to talk about classified things related to being Commander-in-Chief, or international policy, and use today as that venue for that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, President Obama did use this occasion to talk about some important foreign policy priorities. I don't know the extent to which those conversations would be classified, in part because I didn't hear them. So there was important information that was discussed, but I don't know where they would rate on the classification scale.\nQ: Following up on Julie's question, did the -- because there was this reference to \"high-flying assets,\" which might have been Air Force One or some reference to the perks that come with the White House. Did the President take a moment to even make reference to the value of an encrypted smartphone?\nMR. EARNEST: Oh, I don't know to what extent they talked about personal communications devices, but presumably they will.\nQ: Third question is, the President is still the titular head of the Democratic Party. To what extent will he weigh in on the leadership questions that the DNC is facing?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, having moved to Washington D.C. in 2001 for the first time, the Democratic Party was facing a similar question -- because when there's one party that's in the White House and that same party controls Congress, it elevates the position of the chair of the DNC. So it's an important decision.\nI don't know to what extent President Obama will weigh in on it. As I recall from 2001, that was a race that was hotly contested and closely covered by the news media, and I would anticipate that candidates for that position will covet the endorsement of the outgoing President. I don't know to what extent he'll have one to offer, but we'll keep you posted on all of it.\nAndrew.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. My question goes back to the issue of press access and pools and so on. I mean, you spoke about -- glowingly about press access and all that the White House has done to encourage that. Why, then, did the President tell the President-elect not to answer shouted questions?\nMR. EARNEST: I think he was making clear that he's not obligated to do so. But obviously, the President-elect, if he wanted to answer those shouted questions, he could.\nPresident Obama on many occasions has chosen to answer those questions. On many more occasions, he's chosen not to. And I think that tradition is something that he was communicating to the President-elect.\nVictoria.\nQ: The President-elect, at the beginning of the -- the bottom of the meeting when we saw him, he was fidgeting a little bit and the tenor of his voice was a little nervous for him. He seemed, frankly, awed after 90 minutes with the President. Can you characterize how he seemed? Because he seemed gobsmacked. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: I was standing behind the pool in the Oval Office while they both spoke, so you all had a better view of him than I did. And I was -- frankly, at the beginning of their comments, I was focused on what President Obama was saying. I wasn't reading any body language.\nQ: You don't have any sense of his affect?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't. I don't.\nJ.C.\nQ: Speaking about the smooth transition in terms of cooperation, coordination, and maybe intelligence and insight, might you envision the President and Mr. Trump as they build their relationship that started today -- that there will actually be a conversation in terms of the President's insight on some of the world leaders that Mr. Trump is going to have to deal with in the next two months.\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, they don't have any additional meetings that are on the books right now, but I wouldn't rule out future meetings. And again, if President-elect Trump were interested in President Obama's counsel about his communications or his relationship with some foreign leader, I'm confident that President Obama would not hesitate to share it.\nCheryl.\nQ: Thanks. A CR expires December 9th. Does the election change any of the strategy on finishing the spending bills for this year, or are you just going to do a CR --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me answer your question first by saying, no, that we have consistently advocated for Congress fulfilling its responsibility to pass budgets that give agencies in the federal government certainty about the budget picture. That's particularly true when you're talking about the kinds of commitments that are made by the Department of Defense and our intelligence communities that expend significant sums of money to keep us safe. And just funding them two or three or four months at a time is not a smart way to do it.\nSo we'll engage in conversations with Capitol Hill, and President Obama has already done that with the Republican leader, to talk to them and to urge them to fulfill their basic responsibility to pass the kind of budget that would provide some certainty to military, national security and other federal government officials that have important responsibilities. The President believes it's important to give them certainty so that they can make longer-term decisions with confidence.\nQ: So just the reverse of that real quick, have you heard from Capitol Hill on whether they agree with that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I'll let members on Capitol Hill express their own view, but there have been a number of conversations, mostly at the staff level, about this and other topics that relate to the work that Congress must get done before the end of the year.\nQ: Josh, given the statement of Trump, et al, that they want to revoke Obama executive orders as soon as they can, has that in any way put the brakes of any anticipated executive orders? And do you still have a stream of them that's expected between now and January 20th?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have anything to say about upcoming executive orders other than to tell you that I'm not aware that any of our plans in that area has been affected by the outcome of the election.\nQ: Do you expect a lot more commutations between now and the end? Because there seems to have been a very concentrated effort to deal with people in prison for long drug-related terms. What was the forecast on that? And is this a part of Obama's legacy that can't be taken away, as you see it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President has made this a priority and the President does believe that there are some injustices that can be corrected using his clemency authorities. And he's done that with respect to a certain classification of convictions more than the last 10 or 11 Presidents combined.\nSo I do think that's an important part of his legacy. He would much prefer that his legacy include the passage of criminal justice reform legislation that would be much more effective in addressing some of the widespread inequities that leaders in both parties have identified.\nUnfortunately, that has not happened. I don't know if Congress will get that done before the end of the year. The President will certainly encourage them to try to do that. And there is bipartisan agreement around this. I can't speak to the President's-elect view of this priority, but obviously it's one that President Obama and his team have invested deeply in.\nI would expect additional commutations before the President leaves office. But those are the kind of commutation decisions that have been in the pipeline even before the outcome of the election, and I'm not aware that the outcome of the election would have any impact on those clemency decisions.\nQ: Is there any piece of legacy legislation that you think you can get passed before he leaves office?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, that's what -- we'll be having some conversations about that. So we'll see.\nFrancesca, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. Let me start by saying I appreciate you pointing out that in 2000 and in 2008, that reporters didn't have access to the Oval Office meeting, because some of us were not there at that time to remember that. I appreciate you pointing that out about the Oval Office access meeting. I think what we're trying to understand is what the thinking behind not allowing reporters to be on the South Lawn today was, what the thinking was behind that and why that happened?\nMR. EARNEST: The idea was just that we wanted to provide you the best access that we could. And the best access that all of you have consistently advocated for, for the last eight years, is access to the President and the person that he's meeting with in the Oval Office with statements in front of the full pool. And that's exactly what was provided today.\nQ: And what then, if anything, should we draw from the fact that we have neither heard from, nor seen the First Lady today?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, as I mentioned earlier, we'll consult with the White House photographer -- presumably you guys have been able to do that already. So we'll try to expedite the release of a photo so that you can see that interaction.\nBut I can tell you that the First Lady enjoyed the opportunity that she had to welcome Mrs. Trump to the White House and to give her the tour that I described earlier, and to discuss the unique demands of raising a family in the White House. And the First Lady was pleased to extend that courtesy to Mrs. Trump and enjoyed the opportunity that she had to visit with her today.\nQ: And as far as the photos go, may we also possibly put in a request for some of the ones you described on the Truman Balcony? I don't know if a photographer was following them around then as well. If there's any photos like that you could possibly release that would be helpful, too.\nMR. EARNEST: We'll see what we have. I don't know how closely the White House photographer was covering them while they were walking through the private residence, but we'll see what we can do.\nThanks, everybody.\nEND 2:32 P.M.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119640", "text": "The peaceful transfer of power is a bedrock principle of our democracy. The President was grateful for the time and care put into the 2008 transition by President Bush's Administration. That is why he directed his team last year to make a smooth transition between administrations a top priority of his final year in office even as he remained committed to using every remaining day of his presidency to deliver on his agenda for the American people.\nStarting in early 2016, Administration officials began to map out the transition planning, including three key components: preparing for the incoming administration, ensuring this Administration's records are appropriately archived, and facilitating the off-boarding of current Administration personnel. To coordinate the planning across government, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough convened the President's Cabinet in March to give an overview of the transition process and set the expectation that the transition should be a top priority for every federal agency.\nThe President also established the White House Transition Coordinating Council (WHTCC) and the Agency Transition Directors Council (ATDC), which have met regularly throughout the year. The transition has also been a standing agenda item for the monthly President's Management Council (PMC) meeting, comprised of Deputy Secretaries of major agencies. To coordinate government-wide activities, the Administration also established a regular meeting of agencies with special transition responsibilities, including the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), General Services Administration (GSA), Department of Justice (DOJ), Office of Government Ethics (OGE), National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and Department of Homeland Security (DHS). These agencies play a unique government-wide role during a presidential transition, such as DOJ which processes security clearances for the incoming teams or OGE which reviews the ethics requirements for nominees.\nAfter the nominating conventions, each candidate's transition team began working out of GSA-provided space and began attending WHTCC and ATDC meetings and engaging regularly with Administration officials on their planning efforts. For example, the Administration and both candidates' transition teams developed common expectations for engaging with agencies so agencies knew what to expect right after the election. This collaboration helped agencies better plan for and focus their efforts on what the transition teams would most likely need. Throughout this period, the Administration assisted both candidates' transition teams in a non-partisan manner, providing equitable services and information to each.\nPost-Election Transition Period\nAs with past presidential transitions, following the Election, the Federal government has begun to engage with the President-Elect's Transition Team (PTT). This week, Agency Review Teams selected by the President-Elect, will begin to reach out to their designated counterparts at agencies across the government. The President-Elect's Agency Review Teams will receive detailed, agency-specific briefings that have been prepared by current Administration officials. Those briefings include organizational charts, budget materials, briefings on key agency priorities and areas of responsibility, and other materials describing the essential functions of that agency. In addition to the initial briefings, designated employees across the Administration will work closely with their Agency Review Teams in order to facilitate open communication between the outgoing and incoming Administrations. Simultaneously, the President-Elect's Transition Team will establish policy teams that will work out of GSA-provided office space in Washington, D.C.\nThe Administration is also taking steps to ensure the next President and his or her team is prepared from day one to protect our national security. As part of a longstanding tradition, building off the intelligence briefings the two candidates received before the election, the President-Elect and other senior officials will begin receiving daily intelligence briefings from the intelligence community. In addition, the Administration is hosting two interagency exercises to inform and familiarize the incoming administration on domestic incident management practices used by the current administration. These exercises are designed to provide a high-level perspective on a series of challenges that the next administration may confront and to introduce the key authorities, policies, capabilities, and structures that are currently in place to respond to major domestic incidents.\nThe Administration will also continue its work in the two other areas of focus: archiving records and off-boarding current Administration personnel. Thus far, the Administration has transferred roughly 283 million files to NARA, comprising 122,000 GB of data. In addition to the transfer of electronic records, NARA has also begun to facilitate the move of the President's physical records to Chicago, Illinois, where they will ultimately be preserved at President Obama's library. This move includes the transfer of textual, electronic, and audiovisual records, and tens of thousands of presidential gifts.\nAnd, the Administration is committed to providing out-going appointees the information they need to plan for their own transitions.  In support of the well-respected principle that the incoming President selects her or his own team, the President has asked appointees to submit resignation letters effective no later than the inauguration of the new President. In conjunction with this off-boarding process, Administration officials have been working with agency personnel offices to provide additional personnel and benefits information to appointees prior to the end of the Administration.\nModernizing the Transition\nIn undertaking the transition, the Administration has sought to streamline, formalize, and modernize the transition. Key improvements to the transition process that the Administration has implemented include:\nBeginning Formal Transition Planning Earlier: Recognizing the significant challenge posed by a Presidential transition, the Obama Administration began the formal transition planning process at the beginning of this year. In May, the President signed an Executive Order appointing the first Federal Transition Coordinator to centralize transition planning across the agencies. The President also established the two transition councils, the WHTCC and ATDC – marking the earliest the Federal government has ever begun formal interagency preparations for the Presidential transition. To ensure agencies are prepared for the drastic personnel change that comes with transition, the Administration also began to prepare senior career officials who may serve in acting political positions for their new role earlier in the transition process.\nIn addition, recognizing the unprecedented volume of electronic data from this administration that needs to be preserved, Administration officials began monthly planning meetings with NARA in 2012 and commenced the first test?runs of data transfers in April 2015. The Executive of the President (EOP) then began to transfer presidential records to NARA's Electronic Records Archive in May 2016– the earliest that the EOP has ever begun transferring substantial quantities of electronic records to NARA in preparation for a transition.\nStreamlined Transition Materials: In conjunction with the ATDC, the Administration hosted conversations on best practices for assembling transition materials for the next Administration. Drawing upon the expertise of individuals with previous transition experience, these conversations resulted in tailored and more concise briefing materials that more readily addressed the needs of the incoming teams. In addition, in some cases, agencies used modern technology including collaboration websites, tablets and apps to deliver that material. For example, the DHS pre-loaded materials onto tablets in a searchable format.\nIn addition, the White House has worked to better document the broader transition planning effort in order to hand the next Administration a step-by-step guide of how to manage a government-wide transition. This effort includes documenting the Agency Review Team process, collating guidance documents, establishing key milestones, and other metrics.\nDeveloped Architecture for A ‘Digital Transition': Recognizing the unique and unprecedented challenge of archiving and preserving the Administration's digital infrastructure, the Administration set out several months ago to develop a plan that would: 1) ensure the proper archiving of all digital records, consistent with the Presidential Records Act; 2) where possible, allow real time access to the content the Administration created on the platforms in which the content originated; and 3) ensure that the next president and administration could continue to use and build upon the digital assets this Administration created to connect directly with the people they serve. As a result, the Administration developed and released a first-of-its-kind  digital transition plan that meets these key goals.\nDeveloped New On-Boarding Systems: One of the biggest challenges facing the incoming Administration is filling over 4,000 political appointee positions as quickly as possible. To better streamline this process, GSA working in conjunction with the Presidential Personnel Office (PPO) and White House IT collaborated with the candidates' transition teams to design and develop an online human resources application for the collection, categorization, assignment, and processing of applications for positions in the new Administration. This approach combined the IT expertise of GSA and White House IT with the real-world experience of PPO who manages the appointee process from application through appointment. This new system can serve as a single tool for processing a candidate from application through appointment, rather than the multiple systems used at the beginning of the current Administration. In addition, PPO provided data on executive branch agencies, offices, and positions with which to populate the system, avoiding the need to duplicate the lengthy and labor-intensive data collection and entry conducted for the current system utilized by PPO. After the Inauguration, this new tool can be utilized by the incoming President to replace the legacy system currently used by PPO, allowing the incoming Administration to use the same tool and processes before and after the Inauguration. It can also be more easily tailored to the specific policies and processes the new Administration decides to adopt.\nIn addition, the OGE has developed a new e-filing system, Integrity, which allows nominees for Presidentially-appointed, Senate-confirmed (PAS) positions to enter their financial disclosure information online through a secure website and for ethics officials to review the forms and communicate back with the nominees via the automated system. In September 2016, OGE held orientation sessions on Integrity for each campaign's transition team and has been working with each team so they are prepared to use the system to enter information of potential PAS nominees starting the day after the election and throughout the Presidential transition.\nEngaged Agencies Not Traditionally Included In the Formal Transition Planning Process: In addition to the formal transition councils that the President established, the Administration, for the first time, has also held formal transition planning meetings with smaller agencies, boards and commissions across the government who are not otherwise represented on the two councils. This group, including more than 200 entities, has been engaged fully in the transition process from the beginning and has met regularly over the past several months. The Administration undertook this whole-of-government approach to transition planning in order to help these smaller agencies, board and commissions prepare for the upcoming transition by developing briefing materials for the incoming teams, ensuring continuity of operations as they off-board appointees, and have in place the necessary infrastructure to support incoming appointees.", "timestamp": "2016-11-10", "title": "Fact Sheet: Facilitating a Smooth Transition to the Next Administration"}

This means providing veterans the benefits they have earned, the health care that they need, and the resources and assistance to succeed when transitioning back to civilian life.\nA central tenet of this promise is to make sure that we do all we can to ensure that our service members, veterans, and their families have the protections, resources, information, and support they need to pursue the American dream. Since the beginning of the Administration, the President has made a commitment to improve education outcomes for service members, veterans, and their family members. And that begins with enabling them to maximize their federal education benefits, including benefits provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) under the Post-9/11 GI Bill, the Department of Defense's (DOD) Tuition Assistance Program, and the Department of Education's (ED) Federal student aid programs.\nThe Obama Administration has delivered on that promise through actions that expand access to high-quality postsecondary opportunities for our Nation's heroes. In 2012, President Obama announced the  Principles of Excellence Executive Order, to ensure that veterans, service members, and their families have adequate information, support, and protections while using their federal education benefits. Since then, the Administration has made significant progress, with over 6,000 educational institutions signing on to provide access to information and increased oversight of programs. We have launched the GI Bill Comparison Tool, which has made it easier for over 1.3 million individuals to research educational institutions and training programs approved for the GI Bill and also compare educational institutions. The Post-9/11 GI Bill has provided nearly 1.7 million individuals with $68.9 billion in education benefits since its inception in 2009. The President signed legislation that expanded Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits eligibility criteria under the Marine Gunnery Sergeant John David Fry Scholarship to the surviving spouses and children of service members who died in the line of duty after September 10, 2001, and legislation requiring all 50 states, Washington D.C., and U.S. Territories to provide recently transitioning veterans and dependents in-state tuition rates at public institutions of higher learning – and now all 50 states are doing just that.\nBut there is more work to be done. That is why, on this Veterans Day, the President is announcing new measures to ensure that service members, veterans, and their families are treated fairly when they use their Federal education benefits. Building on the Principles of Excellence issued by the President and other executive actions, the Administration is expanding on these efforts by issuing a Presidential Memorandum that outlines additional steps, including:\n* Establishing a pilot program to inform school choice:Developing and launching a pilot program and evaluation to find the best methods for counseling service members and helping them to make informed educational choices when enrolling in educational and training programs. ED, DOD, VA, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will collaborate on the design and evaluation of this pilot.\n* Improving data-sharing: Improving data sharing among Federal agencies, including the Department of Labor (DOL), DOD, ED, and VA, to increase transparency and improve access to comprehensive information on service member and veteran student outcome measures, including education attainment, career outcomes, student debt levels, and student default rates.\n* Expanding the use of online tools: Strengthening online resources, such as the GI Bill Comparison Tool and College Scorecard, through the work of VA and ED, to make it easier for prospective students to evaluate the quality of the programs they are considering.\n* Promoting military apprenticeship programs:Taking steps to promote the enhancement and implementation of military apprenticeship programs for service members and spouses through coordination by DOL, DOD, ED, and DHS. This includes developing a plan to enhance and implement military apprenticeship opportunities for service members to improve job skills and obtain industry-recognized credentials and certificates while on active duty; exploring the expansion of the current United Services Military Apprenticeship Program (USMAP) to include all services; and working to further reduce barriers to employment caused by restrictive state occupational licensing requirements for military spouses and service members transitioning to civilian jobs.\n* Amending the Post-9/11 GI Bill: Developing a legislative proposal to amend the Post-9/11 GI Bill to ensure that veterans who use their benefits for credentialing and licensing tests are fairly charged.\n* Cracking down on deceptive marketing: Strengthening coordination across Federal agencies and developing standard protocols to protect veterans from deceptive and fraudulent marketing of educational services and benefits.\n* Formalizing collaboration across the government: Formalizing an interagency Working Group with representatives from DOD, DOL, ED, VA, DHS, the Department of Justice (DOJ), Small Business Administration (SBA), Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and other Federal agencies, offices, and initiatives, as appropriate, to coordinate policy development and implementation going forward. The working group will also initiate an enforcement subcommittee to ensure ongoing and continued coordination on strengthening oversight, enforcement, and accountability within these benefits programs and better streamlining protocols and information-sharing.\nThrough these steps, the President is ensuring that the good work done by this Administration will carry forward for years to come, and that veterans, service members, and their families will have the tools they need to succeed in the economy of the 21st century.\nBuilding on a Record of Progress\nIn addition to the actions announced today to strengthen education and training programs for those that have served our country, the Administration continues to take action to address the five core priorities that the President has set out for serving our veterans:\n1. Health Care – Making sure veterans have timely and high-quality access to care\n2. Benefits – Tackling the backlog of claims and modernizing the appeals process\n3. Homelessness – Working to prevent and end veteran homelessness\n4. Economic Opportunity – Fighting to give veterans every chance to enjoy the American Dream\n5. Resources and Transformation at the VA –Making sure VA is serving every veteran\nOver the past eight years, the Administration has made significant strides across each of these five pillars, and we are not letting up. In conjunction with Veterans Day, the Administration is announcing three additional milestones that build on this record of success:\n* Ending Veteran Homelessness in the State of Delaware – In 2010, the Administration released Opening Doors, the nation's first-ever strategic plan to prevent and end homelessness. Since that time, we have made remarkable progress in meeting that goal. We have reduced veteran homelessness by 47% - nearly half – since 2010. And the progress is even more pronounced for those veterans that had been living on the street and without a place to stay, as unsheltered veteran homelessness has declined by 56% since 2010. More than 30 communities and 2 states have previously announced they have ended veteran homelessness. And this week, the state of Delaware is joining that list, announcing that they have put an end to veteran homelessness statewide. Next week, the First Lady and Dr. Biden will convene local officials, homelessness stakeholders, advocates, and others to identify strategies to ensure this critical progress continues.\n* Increasing Federal Hiring of Veterans – In 2009, the Administration embarked on a concerted effort to ensure that the Federal government was doing its part to provide veterans with the employment opportunities they deserve. As part of this, the President signed Executive Order 13518, Employment of Veterans in the Federal Government. And the Administration has made good on that promise. Today, OPM released the Employment of Veterans in the Federal Executive Branch Report for Fiscal Year (FY) 2015. The report notes that 6,000 more veterans were hired in FY15 compared to FY14, bringing the percentage of new veterans hired across the Federal government to 32.5 percent. All told, the Federal government has hired approximately 516,000 veterans since FY09, and veterans now represent 30.9 percent of the Federal workforce, as compared to 25.8 percent in FY 2009.\n* Increasing Data Sharing to Promote Transparency for Veterans and Students – The Department of Education (ED) will use disability data from the Department of Veterans Affairs to proactively contact disabled veterans who have student loan debt and inform them of ED's total and permanent disability (TPD) discharge process. Unlike other borrowers, those identified through the data match will not be required to submit documentation of their eligibility. Instead, they are eligible for a streamlined process by which they simply sign and return the completed application. This effort will ensure that eligible borrowers with disabilities can more efficiently and effectively apply for TPD discharge of their students loans.\nThese efforts build on progress made across-the-board – cutting the backlog of initial disability claims by nearly 90 percent, increasing veterans' access to health care, increasing the overall level of funding requested for VA benefits and programs by over 85 percent, and reducing the veteran unemployment rate by more than half.\nMoving forward, the Administration is committed to making sure this work carries on far into the future, ensuring that our nation upholds the sacred covenant made with those that have served this country.", "timestamp": "2016-11-10", "title": "Fact Sheet: Ensuring Veterans Have the Tools to Succeed"}

Welcome to the White House, and give it up for the World Champion Cleveland Cavaliers! That's right, I said \"World Champion\" and \"Cleveland\" in the same sentence. [Laughter] That's what we're talking about when we talk about hope and change. [Laughter]\nWe've got a lot of big Cavs fans here in the house, including Ohio's Governor, John Kasich, and his daughters Emma and Reese. We've got some outstanding Members of Congress that are here. And obviously we want to recognize Cavs owner Dan Gilbert, who put so much of himself into trying to make sure this thing worked. One of the great general managers of the game, David Griffin. And the pride and joy of Mexico, Missouri—[laughter]—Coach Tyronn Lue.\nI also, before I go any further, want to give a special thanks to J.R. Smith's shirt for showing up. [Laughter] I wasn't sure if it was going to make an appearance today. I'm glad you came. You're a very nice shirt. [Laughter]\nNow, last season, the Cavs were the favorites in the East all along, but the road was anything but stable. And I'm not even talking about what happened on the court. There were rumors about who was getting along with who, and why somebody wasn't in a picture, and LeBron is tweeting—[laughter]—and this was all big news. But somehow Coach Lue comes in and everything starts getting a little smoother, and they hit their stride in the playoffs. Yes, everybody can sit down, I'll be here for a while. [Laughter]\nThey start winning their first 10 games in the playoffs, setting record after record for three-point shooting. But obviously what this all comes down to is a team that, for the first time in NBA history, comes back from being down 3-1 in the Finals, the first team in history to dig themselves out of a hole like that.\nAnd, I should add, that by knocking off the Warriors, they cemented the 1996 Bulls as the greatest team of all time. [Laughter] So your President thanks you for that. Now——\n[At this point, a baby cried.]\nVice President Joe Biden. Crying.\nThe President. I know, that's funny, isn't it? [Laughter] Yes, it is. See, everybody is happy when their team wins.\nThe comeback was remarkable—and you learn about people when they're down—against a historically good Warriors team. Cavs won games 5 and 6 by double digits. You had both LeBron James and Kyrie Irving becoming the first duo ever to score 40 points apiece in a Finals game. And then, in game 7, the Cavs fall behind on the road, only to fight back and lock up the title with an unbelievable 2 minutes. There was the Block, what LeBron has said was the defining play of his career; the Shot by Kyrie, putting the Cavs up 5; the Stop by Kevin Love. Boy, I mean, Kevin was moving. [Laughter] I hadn't seen defense like that. But it wasn't just those outstanding players, not then and not throughout the year, because this was always a team effort. J.R. always seemed to hit those shots—you know, \"No, no, don't shoot that!\" and then it goes in and, \"Man, that a great shot.\" [Laughter]\nYou got Tristan Thompson who has as great of a motor as anybody and put in extra work to teach himself how to shoot free throws with the wrong hand. I should have tried that with some bill signings around here. [Laughter] You've got Channing Frye who came in right over the trading deadline and changed the tone of the locker room, and his sharpshooting. Richard Jefferson, Dahntay Jones, providing leadership and giving inspiration to all of us old people that you can still do something at that age.\nIman Shumpert, playing not only great defense and scoring, but also delivered his wife's baby in the bathtub—[laughter]—using a pair of headphones to tie off the umbilical cord. Now, that's something right there. [Laughter] That was an all-star move. Got the \"MacGyver\" flat top, which we miss. [Laughter]\nAnd of course, there's the guy LeBron calls the favorite player—his favorite player of all time, James Jones. The two are a package deal: six straight Finals appearances. Their names even go together: LeBron James Jones. [Laughter]\nBut the truth is, LeBron wouldn't be LeBron without his teammates: Kyrie, Kevin, Tristan. Michelle's brother, who was an excellent basketball player, always says that you can learn a lot about somebody's character by the way they play basketball. And when you see LeBron James, it is not just his power and his speed and his vertical. It is his unselfishness, it is his work ethic, it is his insistence on always making the right play, it is his determination—all of which makes him one of the great players of all time.\nAnd you saw it in those last three games, put up some of the most staggering statistics in Finals history. He did it the year before despite injuries, dragging his team along to make a very competitive series. You saw it when this kid from Akron broke down and fell to his knees when he'd realized that he had finally fulfilled a promise that he had made all those years ago and delivered that championship back to Northeast Ohio.\nSo this is a player and this is a team that knows what this title means to Cleveland. This is a city that's, throughout sports history, been through a lot: the Fumble, the Drive, Jordan over Ehlo. A whole lot more. [Laughter] But through it all, Cleveland was always \"Believeland.\"\nAnd that's why the Cavs have always given back to their fans and the community that's been so loyal to them. Over the last 22 years, they've given more than $23 million to local charities. And more than just the money: players and coaches have made about 200 visits annually to schools, hospitals, food kitchens, and more, including assisting educational programs that reach more than 100,000 kids in Northeast Ohio.\nAnd these Cavs exemplify a growing generation of athletes that are using their platforms to speak out. We've seen Kevin on combating campus sexual assault; LeBron on issues like gun violence and working with Michelle to help more kids go to school, go to college. His foundation is doing something incredible: paying college tuition for 1,100 kids from Akron. I should mention that, as we were walking out, Dan Gilbert has been unbelievable in the work he's been doing in Detroit—his hometown—and giving back.\nAnd finally, earlier today the Cavs met with Attorney General Loretta Lynch, and my Senior Adviser, Valerie Jarrett, to discuss steps they're taking to help build understanding between law enforcement and the Cleveland community, part of a league-wide effort to build stronger communities all across the country, including holding open conversations so we can begin to bridge divides and defuse tensions, and see each other as one American family. It's really important work. It's one—just one of a number of recent efforts we've been proud to partner with the NBA during my time as President.\nFrom the league's support of \"My Brother's Keeper\" initiative, to the mentoring initiatives, to Michelle's \"Let's Move!\" and Joining Forces efforts, the NBA has been a model for positive change, and the fact that it's not just a responsibility of Government, it takes all of us—businesses, nonprofits, athletes, role models—working together to achieve the progress that we seek.\nSo I know that Cleveland could not be happier and prouder of having this trophy. But this was already a championship group of guys, even before last year, and you should be very proud of them.\nGive it up for the world champs one last time.\nDan, you want to say anything? You guys got anything to say? Come on, Kevin.\nForward Kevin W. Love. So from the 2016 World Champion Cleveland Cavaliers, we wanted to present this '16 Obama jersey.\nThe President. I like this.\nMr. Love. Come on, guys. You got anything else?\nThe President. The—now, the only thing is, though, I don't—these sleeves get tight. Can I tear these out? [Laughter] Can I rip them?\nMr. Love. You can rip them.\nThe President. Can I rip them?\nMr. Love. LeBron rips them.\nForward LeBron R. James. I'll show you exactly how to do it.

It helps cultivate passion and inspire young people to build and create; analyze and discover; understand and empathize with the people around them, and through education, students can form a deeper understanding of history and society, literature and languages, and how things work and why they do. During American Education Week, we recognize the importance of education and renew our commitment to bringing a better education within reach for all our people.\nAmerica's high school graduation rate is now the highest ever recorded, and the hard work people across our country have put in is paying off. States have set higher, better standards to help us out-teach and out-compete other nations. Teachers are going that extra mile to create meaningful and memorable lessons, rather than merely teaching to a test, and we have given them more flexibility to do so through the Every Student Succeeds Act—a bipartisan bill I signed last year to improve schools, give State and local lawmakers more control, and target resources to where they are needed most. But across our country, there are unfortunately still too many places where we can do far better for our students. Too many schools are underfunded and lack the resources or structures they need to prepare students for success, and for far too many students, their zip codes still determine how far they can go.\nFrom strengthening high-quality early education and preschool to bolstering access to higher education, my Administration has made improving our education system a priority for our students from their first days of school to the days they start their careers. Nobody should be priced out of a higher education, so we are striving to make college more affordable and provide 2 years of free community college for any student willing to work for it. We also reformed the student loan system and expanded Pell grants to more students. The demands of our global economy and changing technology require students to learn real-world skills such as computer science in the classroom, so we are bringing new technology and digital tools, including high-speed internet, into classrooms to modernize education. And because too many girls, young people of color, and low-income students are not encouraged and underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) courses and careers, we are investing in ways to broaden STEM participation as well as working to train more STEM teachers.\nEmpowering students of all ages, backgrounds, and beliefs to challenge themselves to reach higher, education can lift up a generation, allowing them to carry the torch of progress forward and make our world a better place. This week, let us recommit to the important work that remains and ensure every student in America can access the support, resources, and opportunities they need to thrive.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 13 through November 19, 2016, as American Education Week. I call upon all Americans to observe this week by supporting their local schools and educators through appropriate activities, events, and programs designed to help create opportunities for every school and student in America.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-11-10", "title": "Proclamation 9540—American Education Week, 2016"}

They have been instrumental in combating previously deadly or debilitating illnesses and have saved countless lives. Yet the misuse of antibiotics can pose risks to public health. As antibiotics have become more commonly prescribed and misused in all health care settings, bacteria have developed the capability to resist them, which can undermine their effectiveness. Get Smart About Antibiotics Week is an important opportunity to highlight the need to use antibiotics responsibly.\nAntibiotic-resistant bacteria cause tens of thousands of deaths each year in the United States alone, and millions of Americans contract antibiotic-resistant illnesses that are difficult and expensive to treat. A major factor contributing to the emergence of antibiotic resistance is the inappropriate use of antibiotics, which are among the most frequently prescribed medicines and are also given to animals that are used for food. When a person takes antibiotics for a bacterial infection, bacteria sensitive to that medicine are generally destroyed or prevented from growing further—but bacteria that are resistant to that antibiotic will multiply, making current or future bacterial infections even worse and harder to treat. When antibiotics are used inappropriately, including when they are not needed—such as for treating viral infections like the common cold, or used in wrong doses or for the wrong period of time—the likelihood of antibiotic resistance is greatly increased, reducing the effectiveness of these antibiotics in the future. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria and infections cost our country tens of billions of dollars in health care expenses, but more importantly, if we lose effective antibiotic options for treating people, more patients will be put at risk—unless we act now.\nThat is why my Administration has taken action to reduce the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and help ensure the continued availability of effective therapeutics for the treatment of bacterial infections. In 2014, I signed an Executive Order that created the Task Force for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria, established an interagency approach to improve our Nation's antibiotic use, and built a framework to strengthen surveillance systems so important data on antibiotic-resistant bacteria can more easily be shared and tracked to prevent and control infections. We also launched the National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria, through which we are working to slow the emergence of resistant bacteria and accelerate research efforts to develop alternative treatments, diagnostic tools, and vaccines. Last year, with recognition that our public health is connected to the health of animals and the environment, especially with regards to the spread of disease, we hosted the White House Forum on Antibiotic Stewardship to bring together key human and animal health stakeholders to identify successful strategies and opportunities for collaboration. We must continue working with food producers, health care providers, leaders in the private sector, and the American people to improve our antibiotic use.\nWith a sustained commitment to promoting the appropriate use of antibiotics, we can address this growing public health problem. In September, the United Nations General Assembly pledged their commitment to international cooperation to combat this global threat to human health, development, and security, and heads of states came together to commit to initiating, increasing, and sustaining awareness of antimicrobial resistance. This week, we resolve to improve awareness of the threat of antibiotic resistance to our public health, and we encourage medical professionals to prescribe, and patients to use, antibiotics responsibly. Let us ensure that future generations can access safe and effective antibiotics, and together let us address the harmful effects of antibiotic resistance.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 13 through November 19, 2016, as Get Smart About Antibiotics Week. I call upon the scientific community, medical professionals, educators, businesses, industry leaders, and all Americans to observe this week by promoting the responsible use of antibiotics and raising awareness of the dangers inherent in their misuse and overuse.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-11-10", "title": "Proclamation 9541—Get Smart About Antibiotics Week, 2016"}

But with grit and determination, our people fought their way back and began working to rebuild an economy that works for everyone. Although we have added more than 15 million jobs in the last 6 years, too many people are still feeling left behind in our 21st-century economy. And because the jobs of today and tomorrow require more advanced skills and training, apprenticeship programs play an increasingly important role in helping people succeed in the workforce. This week, we celebrate the ways this job-driven training model prepares Americans for meaningful employment, and we resolve to expand access to this essential pathway to opportunity.\nRegistered apprenticeships connect job-seekers to better paying jobs that are in high demand, and by providing hands-on experiences and allowing Americans to earn while they learn, they help workers gain the skills and knowledge necessary to thrive in our modern economy. More than 90 percent of apprentices find employment after completing their programs, with graduates earning an average starting salary over $60,000. In addition to benefitting employees, apprenticeship programs also help employers by increasing productivity and innovation with a high return on investment. A variety of industries—from healthcare to construction to information technology and advanced manufacturing—are using apprenticeship programs to meet their workforce needs. To bolster the competitiveness of those industries and others, it is imperative that our Nation continues investing in apprenticeship programs. Across our country, State and local leaders have done just that—in some cases expanding apprenticeships by over 20 percent in their regions. And since 2014, 290 colleges have joined in the effort to offer college credit toward a degree for completing apprenticeship programs.\nMy Administration applauds these widespread efforts and remains committed to supporting apprenticeship programs. Two years ago, I announced a goal to double the number of registered apprenticeships, and with 125,000 more active apprenticeships today than in 2014, we have seen the largest 3-year increase in nearly a decade. We invested unprecedented levels of Federal funding in apprenticeships, including recently awarding more than $50 million in new grants to States through the ApprenticeshipUSA initiative. This year, we also invested over $20 million to start new apprenticeship programs and help historically underrepresented individuals—including women, minorities, and people with disabilities—access apprenticeship programs. Last year, I signed the first-ever annual Federal funding for apprenticeship programs into law, and I will keep calling on the Congress to continue funding these efforts so that this work is carried forward for years to come. And because those who have served our country in uniform deserve every opportunity to enjoy the American dream they helped defend, we are working to provide assistance to service members and veterans who seek to enter registered apprenticeship programs.\nDuring National Apprenticeship Week, employers, sponsors, and leaders across our country will host open houses to highlight the significant value of apprenticeships in our economy. Let us encourage more employers to offer—and more workers to take advantage of—these indispensable learning and training opportunities, and together let us continue working to equip the American workforce to meet the demands of an ever changing future so it is filled with prosperity and opportunity for all who are willing to work for it. Now, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 13 through November 19, 2016, as National Apprenticeship Week. I urge the Congress, State and local governments, educational institutions, industry and labor leaders, and all Americans to support apprenticeship programs in the United States and to raise awareness of their contributions to our country.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-11-10", "title": "Proclamation 9542—National Apprenticeship Week, 2016"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119629", "text": "Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies\nSubject: Advancing Fair Practices by Education and Training Institutions Serving Service Members, Veterans, Eligible Spouses, and Other Family Members\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct the following:\nSection 1. Purpose. This memorandum directs executive departments and agencies (agencies) to perform certain functions to further strengthen the Federal Government's work in promoting fair practices by education and training institutions serving service members, veterans, eligible spouses, and other family members.\nSec. 2. Background. Throughout my Administration, I have prioritized efforts to ensure that we are fulfilling our promises to all those who have served. I have called upon my Administration to do all we can to ensure that our service members, veterans, eligible spouses, and other family members who have given so much to our Nation have the protections, resources, information, and support they need in order to pursue the American dream. Available data show that approximately 200,000 service members transition from military service annually to pursue careers, start businesses, or enroll in postsecondary institutions. Since its enactment, the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008 (Title V of Public Law 110-252) (Post-9/11 GI Bill) has provided more than 1.7 million individuals with $68.9 billion in education benefits. In addition, the Department of Defense's Tuition Assistance Program continues to provide service members, veterans, eligible spouses, and other family members access to high-quality education.\nOn April 27, 2012, I signed Executive Order 13607 (Establishing Principles of Excellence for Educational Institutions Serving Service Members, Veterans, Spouses, and Other Family Members). The \"Principles of Excellence\" set forth in that order apply to institutions receiving Federal and military educational funding and are designed to strengthen oversight, enforcement, and accountability within Federal military and veterans educational and training benefits programs. Institutions receiving Federal and military educational funding must, among other requirements, 1) provide meaningful information to service members, veterans, eligible spouses, and other family members regarding the cost and quality of educational institutions to assist prospective students in making choices about how to use Federal educational benefits; 2) prevent abusive and deceptive recruiting practices that target the recipients of Federal military and veterans educational benefits; and 3) ensure that they provide high-quality academic and student support services to active-duty service members, reservists, members of the National Guard, veterans, and military families.\nAgencies have since made significant strides toward fully implementing the Principles of Excellence. They have released guidelines clarifying obligations under the Principles of Excellence; launched the GI Bill Comparison Tool to allow individuals to calculate estimated Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, research school attributes, and compare educational institutions; created a centralized complaint system for students receiving Federal military and education benefits to further strengthen the integrity and accountability of these programs; launched \"Tuition Assistance DECIDE,\" a tool that enables service members to search for information about educational costs and outcomes tailored to their circumstances; developed comprehensive veteran-student outcome measures; and strengthened data and information sharing across agencies to further these goals.\nAlthough thousands of institutions have committed to the Principles of Excellence, more work remains to strengthen oversight, enforcement, and accountability within these benefits programs so that these critical investments are protected and can continue to serve our service members, veterans, their eligible spouses, and other family members. To accomplish these goals, we must continue to improve the coordination of Federal tools and resources, provide new mechanisms to increase collaboration across Federal agencies, identify best practices that can support and inform initiatives to enhance educational and career readiness and success, implement better data-sharing strategies, and develop more streamlined protocols to improve enforcement and information sharing.\nTherefore, today I am directing agencies to take additional steps to ensure fair practices in education and training institutions serving veterans and service members by implementing the policies described in this memorandum. In addition, I am directing the creation of an interagency working group to further implement the policies and priorities described in this memorandum.\nSec. 3. Policy. It is the policy of the Federal Government to provide service members, veterans, eligible spouses, and other family members with the information and support they need in order to make informed decisions about their education and training options throughout the military life cycle, both during their transition from the military to civilian life, and after their separation from the military. It is also the policy of the Federal Government to improve resources for veterans while they are enrolled in school or a training program, and to protect students and taxpayers from the subset of institutions of higher education that engage in fraudulent, deceptive, and other predatory practices that harm students. Compiling accurate and reliable data is a critical part of strengthening this work and achieving better outcomes for service members, veterans, eligible spouses, and other family members, and it is the policy of the Federal Government to have appropriate mechanisms in place to facilitate data sharing among agencies. These policies build on the following statutes, Presidential directives, and initiatives:\n(a) The VOW to Hire Heroes Act of 2011 (Title II of Public Law 112-56) (the \"VOW Act\") brought about the first redesign of the Department of Defense's Transition Assistance Program (TAP) in over 20 years. Seven Federal agencies—the Departments of Defense, Education, Labor, Veterans Affairs, and Homeland Security, the Small Business Administration, and the Office of Personnel Management—and the military branches coordinated efforts to launch the revamped TAP in 2013, in order to serve over 200,000 eligible transitioning service members annually. TAP provides key information, tools, and training to service members, eligible spouses, and eligible dependents to help prepare them for civilian life, whether they are pursuing education, searching for employment, or starting a business.\n(b) Public Law 112-249 (commonly referred to as the Improving Transparency of Education Opportunities for Veterans Act of 2012), requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to develop a comprehensive policy to improve outreach and transparency to service members and veterans. The Department of Veterans Affairs memorialized that comprehensive outreach and transparency policy in a report to the Congress in April 2013.\n(c) Executive Order 13607 (Establishing Principles of Excellence for Educational Institutions Serving Service Members, Veterans, Spouses, and Other Family Members), signed on April 27, 2012, directs the Departments of Defense, Education, and Veterans Affairs to establish Principles of Excellence to ensure that educational institutions receiving funding from Federal education and training resources, including the Post-9/11 GI Bill and the Tuition Assistance Program, provide meaningful information to service members, veterans, eligible spouses, and other family members when making choices about their Federal educational benefits. This order was a direct response to reports of aggressive and deceptive recruiting of this population by some educational institutions.\n(d) Presidential Study Directive/PSD-9, issued in May 2010, directed the development of a coordinated Federal Government-wide approach to supporting military families. That approach was memorialized in a January 2011 report, \"Strengthening Our Military Families: Meeting America's Commitment,\" that identifies priority areas for addressing the concerns and challenges facing military families, including developing career and educational opportunities for military spouses by increasing access to educational advancement and by reducing barriers to employment caused by different State policies and standards.\n(e) The \"8 Keys to Veterans' Success\" initiative, a voluntary initiative announced in August 2013 by the Departments of Education and Veterans Affairs, identifies specific steps that postsecondary institutions can commit to take to assist service members and veterans to transition to the classroom, complete their postsecondary programs, and obtain career skills that will help them succeed upon graduation.\n(f) The Military Credentialing and Licensing Task Force, established in 2012 at my direction by the Department of Defense, focuses on identifying opportunities for service members to earn civilian occupational credentials and licenses without the need for additional training. All branches of the military worked with manufacturing credentialing agencies to enable up to 126,000 service members to gain industry-recognized, nationally portable certifications for high-demand manufacturing jobs.\nSec. 4. Strengthening Interagency Coordination.\n(a) Federal Interagency Working Group. There is hereby established an interagency Working Group on Fair Practices in Veterans Education and Training Programs (Working Group), to be co-chaired by the Director of the National Economic Council (NEC) and the Director of the Domestic Policy Council (DPC), or their designees. The Working Group shall also include an agency Co-Chair, to be rotated annually among the Secretaries of Defense, Labor, Education, and Veterans Affairs, or their designees. The Working Group will coordinate the development and execution of policy proposals to further the goals outlined in this memorandum. The Working Group may consult and engage with other Federal interagency working groups as appropriate to ensure that related activities are coordinated. The Working Group shall meet at least quarterly.\n(b) Representation. In addition to the NEC and DPC, the Working Group shall include representatives from:\n(i) the Department of Defense;\n(ii) the Department of Justice;\n(iii) the Department of Labor;\n(iv) the Department of Education;\n(v) the Department of Veterans Affairs;\n(vi) the Department of Homeland Security;\n(vii) the Small Business Administration;\n(viii) the Office of Personnel Management;\n(ix) the National Security Council staff; and\n(x) any other Federal agencies, offices, or initiatives invited to participate by the Co-Chairs. Sec. 5. Fair Practices for Education and Training Institutions Serving Service Members and Veterans. Building on the policies that are detailed in section 3 of this memorandum, and to the extent permitted by law, the relevant agencies shall develop and implement actions and initiatives as set forth below to promote fair practices in education and training institutions serving service members, veterans, eligible spouses, and other family members to ensure that they are treated fairly in using their Federal education benefits. These actions and initiatives should help ensure better educational outcomes by enhancing front-end counseling programs and improving online consumer tools to help students make informed decisions regarding education programs; executing data linking agreements among Federal agencies to improve information sharing on student outcome measures; and developing new measures to combat continued deceptive and predatory practices by certain institutions of higher education.\n(a) The Department of Education shall establish a pilot program and a corresponding evaluation, in consultation with the Departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Homeland Security (with respect to the United States Coast Guard, as appropriate), to test how improved personalized information, tools, and counseling resources for transitioning service members can promote informed choices for those enrolling in postsecondary education and training. The agencies shall collaborate on the design and evaluation of this pilot, and use technical assistance, data, and resources from the TAP, Chapter 31 Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Services of the Department of Veterans Affairs, Chapter 36 Career and Education Counseling Services of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and other outreach, loan counseling, grant programs, or research initiatives of the agencies to meet this need. The Departments of Defense, Education, Veterans Affairs, and Homeland Security shall enter into an agreement that sets forth the terms for launching this pilot program and evaluation not later than 180 days from the date of this memorandum. This agreement shall specify an appropriate cost-sharing arrangement consistent with applicable appropriations laws and other legal requirements.\n(b) The Departments of Defense, Labor, Education, and Veterans Affairs, with other Working Group members as appropriate, shall develop a plan to establish a data linkage across agencies. The data-linkage plan shall include aggregated information and shall enable individuals to view information about career experiences of beneficiaries before and after their education and training programs; compare beneficiaries' outcome information to those of eligible non-participating veterans; enable more transparent information about other beneficiaries' educational attainment, student debt levels, and loan default rates; and identify educational paths under the Post-9/11 GI Bill that yield the best return on investment in the civilian workforce. The data-linkage plan shall include an appropriate cost-sharing arrangement that is consistent with applicable appropriations laws and other legal requirements. This plan shall be established not later than 180 days from the date of this memorandum.\n(c) The Department of Education and the Department of Veterans Affairs shall take steps to strengthen existing online consumer awareness and educational benefits tools, including the Department of Education's College Scorecard and the Department of Veterans Affairs' GI Bill Comparison Tool, to facilitate access to school performance information, consumer protection information, and key Federal financial aid documents. Consistent with the Paperwork Reduction Act and other applicable statutes, these strengthened tools shall provide accessible and reliable national data on students' outcomes at specific colleges, including aggregated information on former students' earnings, graduates' student debt, and borrowers' repayment rates. Additionally, strengthening these tools shall improve dissemination of public information regarding institutions pertaining to investigations conducted or punitive action taken by Federal or State agencies concerning such institutions. These tools shall be updated not later than 180 days from the date of this memorandum, and shall be further updated at least annually thereafter. (d) The Working Group shall promote the enhancement and implementation of military apprenticeship programs. The military services have taken numerous steps to strengthen and enhance the ability of service members to obtain skills and credentials that can serve them after their military career. Beginning in 2012, the Military Credentialing and Licensing Task Force conducted pilot credentialing programs in transportation and logistics, healthcare support, mechanical work, information technology, and manufacturing that proved very successful. These efforts need to be further institutionalized and amplified. To this end, the Secretary of Defense is directed to:\n(i) in consultation with the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Education, and the Secretary of Homeland Security (with respect to the United States Coast Guard, as appropriate), develop a plan to enhance and implement military apprenticeship programs that provide opportunities for service members to improve their job skills and obtain industry-recognized credentials and certificates of completion for registered apprenticeship programs while on active duty. Strengthening the connections between military training, education, and transition activities registered apprenticeship programs could significantly improve employment opportunities for service members after separation from the service and help employers find qualified workers from this skilled workforce. This plan shall be prepared not later than 180 days from the date of this memorandum; and\n(ii) consider ways to expand the current United Services Military Apprenticeship Program to include all of the services, to increase its use among the services currently included, and to increase the number of service members who gain valuable training and industry-recognized credentials through registered apprenticeship programs. The Secretary of Defense is also directed to consider establishing targets for the number of apprenticeships in each service. The Secretary of Defense shall include an update on these considerations in the plan referenced in section 5(d)(i) of this memorandum.\n(e) The Working Group shall work to enhance opportunities for service members to obtain credentials and licenses that are recognized by civilian employers in an effort to expand employment opportunities for those service members after separation from service, and to reduce barriers to employment caused by state occupational licensing requirements for military spouses and for service members transitioning to civilian jobs.\nTo these ends, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security (with respect to the United States Coast Guard, as appropriate), in consultation with the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Education, and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, shall:\n(i) strengthen the opportunities available for service members under the current program to assist members of the Armed Forces in obtaining professional credentials, as set forth at 10 U.S.C. 2015. These efforts should include working with the Congress to remove program restrictions under which members of the Armed Forces may only obtain credentials that relate to skills and training incident to the performance of the service member's military duties (where consistent with each of the armed service branches' operational needs), and to simplify the requirements relating to credentialing programs to increase the range of credentialing opportunities while maintaining quality assurance. These important changes would enhance the program's flexibility by empowering service members to obtain credentials related to occupations that are in-demand in the civilian economy but that may not directly relate to the specific military duties of the service member, with the effect of significantly expanding the service member's civilian employment opportunities;\n(ii) explore the development and use of performance measures for the military credentialing and licensing program set forth at 10 U.S.C. 2015. Such performance measures would be designed to assess the effectiveness of the program, enhance accountability, and strengthen coordination with other Federal job training and education programs. The Secretary of Defense is directed to consider the feasibility of applying to the program performance measures that are applicable to other Federal job training programs, including measures such as credential attainment, entry into civilian employment, and aggregated information on earnings of service members who attained credentials in the military. The Secretary of Defense also may consider other appropriate performance measures, such as the impact of civilian credential attainment on the annual performance reviews of service members who have completed civilian credentials while on active duty. The Secretary of Defense may carry out pilot or demonstration projects to determine how Federal agencies may collaborate with each other and, where appropriate, the States, to exchange data needed for compiling performance measures on separating service members who obtained civilian credentials while on active duty. Any pilot or demonstration projects the Secretary of Defense chooses to carry out should be accompanied by an evaluation component sufficient to determine whether and how to take the pilot or demonstration project to scale;\n(iii) develop a plan to strengthen the 10 U.S.C. 2015 credentialing program, which shall include recommendations to implement performance measures and to work with the Congress to broaden and simplify the program as described above, and they shall provide an update on such plan to the Co-Chairs of the Working Group within 180 days of the date of this memorandum; and\n(iv) expand efforts to reduce barriers to employment for military spouses and transitioning service members caused by restrictive state occupational licensing requirements. The Federal Government has taken numerous steps to quantify and reduce employment barriers caused by occupational licensing requirements, including by publishing the February 2012 report \"Supporting Our Military Families: Best Practices for Streamlining Occupational Licensing Across State Lines,\" and the July 2015 report \"Occupational Licensing: A Framework for Policymakers.\" The VOW Act also authorized the Assistant Secretary for Veterans' Employment and Training at the Department of Labor to carry out a demonstration project that engages States in efforts to streamline veterans' credentialing and licensing, and outcomes from that demonstration project were published in a September 2015 report. The Working Group shall expand on these efforts by coordinating and cooperating with States in implementing strategies demonstrated to be successful in removing barriers to veterans' licensing and certification, and by conducting additional research as appropriate into how to further reduce barriers caused by state occupational licensing requirements.\n(f) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Education, shall develop a legislative proposal to amend the Post-9/11 GI Bill to ensure that veterans who use their Post-9/11 GI Bill entitlement to take credentialing and licensing tests are charged against entitlement based on the actual costs of each test, and not a minimum of a full month of entitlement (as current law provides). The Secretary of Veterans Affairs should also develop legislative proposals to allow entitlements to be used to cover the costs of other tests or assessment processes that evaluate prior learning and knowledge or provide an opportunity for course credit at an institution of higher learning. These legislative proposals shall be developed and presented to the Co-Chairs of the Working Group not later than 180 days from the date of this memorandum.\n(g) The Working Group shall develop standard protocols across agencies to ensure that nongovernmental websites are not deceptively and fraudulently marketing educational services and benefits to program beneficiaries. This effort shall include establishing procedures to protect the term \"GI Bill\" and other military or veterans-related terms. These protocols and procedures shall be developed within 120 days from the date of this memorandum.\n(h) The Department of Defense, the Department of Justice, the Department of Education, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and other interested Working Group members shall establish an enforcement subcommittee of the Working Group to focus on improving the handling of service member and veteran-student complaints; deterring false or misleading advertising by educational institutions or others concerning their education benefits; advancing protocols for removing non-compliant schools from the Principles of Excellence, or developing other appropriate measures to protect the integrity and accuracy of information about this initiative; and developing a common set of early-warning protocols and accountability measures to improve performance by educational institutions on behalf of service members and veterans. This subcommittee shall be established not later than 120 days from the date of this memorandum. This subcommittee shall coordinate with the interagency oversight task force on career colleges and for-profit educational institutions, established by the Department of Education in May 2015, to avoid overlap and duplication of efforts.\nSec. 6. Federal Agency Implementation Plan. Within 120 days of the issuance of this memorandum, the Working Group shall establish an implementation plan setting forth specific actions that are needed to further the policy objectives identified in this memorandum and that are permitted by law. The implementation plan shall identify the steps necessary to implement the policies and meet the deadlines identified in section 5 of this memorandum. In addition, the implementation plan may identify other agency-specific actions not included in this memorandum that the Working Group should undertake to further promote fair practices in education and training institutions serving service members, veterans, eligible spouses, and other family members.\nSec. 7. General Provisions. (a) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(b) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-11-10", "title": "Memorandum on Advancing Fair Practices by Education and Training Institutions Serving Servicemembers, Veterans, Eligible Spouses, and Other Family Members"}

For State and USAID, a total of $5.8 billion would support the Administration's counter-ISIL and counterterrorism objectives, including the efforts to implement the diplomatic engagement, governance, and stabilization components of my Administration's counter-ISIL strategy, strengthen embassy security, and respond to relief and recovery needs, as well as provide additional humanitarian assistance for areas liberated from ISIL and other unforeseen needs.\nOverall, these amendments would increase the OCO funding requested for FY 2017 by $11.6 billion, for a total FY 2017 OCO request of $85.3 billion. Consistent with last year's bipartisan budget agreement, these amendments would provide equal funding increases for defense and non-defense security programs.\nThe details of these amendments are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.\nWhile these amendments focus on funding our overseas national security efforts, our efforts here at home are equally important to fighting terrorism and protecting the American people. For this reason, I urge the Congress to fully fund not only the international security needs outlined in this request, but also the domestic security programs included in the FY 2017 Budget. Specifically, the Congress should fund critical cybersecurity programs and ensure the Nation has the resources needed to aggressively counter evolving cybersecurity threats. I also encourage the Congress to provide the resources necessary for the Department of Homeland Security's Transportation Security Administration and its Countering Violent Extremism programs.\nSincerely,\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-11-10", "title": "Letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives Transmitting Budget Amendments for Fiscal Year 2017"}

PRICE: Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call to preview the President's trip, starting on Monday, to Greece, Germany and ending in Peru that will take place next week. We'll do the call on the record. It will be embargoed until its conclusion. We have three senior administration officials on today's calls. They are Ben Rhodes, the Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications. We have Wally Adeyemo, the Deputy National Security Advisor for International Economics; and we have Charlie Kupchan who is the NSC Senior Director for European Affairs.\nSo, again, this call is on the record, but it is embargoed until its conclusion. And with that, I'll turn it over to Ben Rhodes.\nMR. RHODES: Thank you, everybody, for getting on the call. I'll just give a summary of the trip and the President's schedule, and then my colleagues may add their thoughts on different elements.\nSo, first of all, the President obviously always was going to travel to the APEC Summit. We made a decision to add a European stop to once again signal our solidarity with our closest allies in the world and nations that have been among the President's closest partners during his eight years in office, to express our support for a strong and integrated and united Europe, which is essential to American national security and to global security and stability, and to reinforce our support for the approaches that have been taken over the last eight years to try to promote economic growth, economic security, and global cooperation on a whole range of issues.\nWe're beginning in Greece. And this is the President's first trip to Greece. This will be the final state visit of the administration. He has long wanted to travel to Greece, given the deeply rooted U.S.-Greek friendship and partnership and our shared commitment to economic stability and prosperity, the work we do together to combat terrorism and extremism, the cooperation we have through the NATO alliance, and of course, the democratic values we share, which are deeply rooted in Greek history.\nOver the course of the administration, one of the principal challenges for President Obama had been recovering from the global financial crisis that was such an emergency when he took office in the United States and around the world. Part of that work after we climbed out of our economic hole was helping to support the Europeans as they dealt with some significant structural issues, including the Greeks, who had to make some very difficult decisions even as they were working with other members of the Euro Zone to resolve some of the structural challenges. And so, again, this is an issue that President Obama personally spent a lot of work on throughout the course of his presidency.\nSo he'll be able to express support for the sacrifices that the Greek people have made to balance their budget and reform their economy. I think he'll want to praise the important progress that they've made over the course of the past year as the Greek parliament has passed that will make their economy more competitive. We recognize there's more to be done. The IMF has said that they believe it's crucial to put Greece's economy on a sustainable path and set the stage for a return to lasting prosperity. And we believe Greece will succeed if it stays focused on opening itself up for business with these ongoing structural reforms -- privatization, transparency, and cleanup of the financial sector.\nAnd we also believe that Greece's creditors must ensure that Greece is well-placed to move beyond its cycle of crisis so they can return to robust economic growth. And that includes through meaningful debt release. And we will continue to support these efforts as we have over the course of President Obama's time in office.\nIn Greece, we will arrive on Tuesday morning, on November 15th. And the President will have a courtesy call with the President of Greece. He will then have a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Tsipris -- those meetings where he'll discuss all of the issues I mentioned. That night, the President will be hosted at a state dinner in Greece to celebrate the Greek-American friendship and alliance.\nSo on Wednesday, November 16th, the President will tour the Parthenon. He certainly wants to see and experience the history in Athens that is at the root of so many of the democratic values that has fueled the growth and success of Western nations and people all over the world.\nHe will then give a speech that afternoon where he will want to focus on the important work that's been done to try to address the economic challenges in Greece and Europe and around the world. I think you'll see him hit very similar themes to what he discussed at the U.N. General Assembly about the need to recognize the challenges presented by globalization which are manifested in many recent elections, including our own, but to take approaches that continue to invest in democratic governance, open markets but efforts to promote more inclusive growth and combat inequality. So he'll have an opportunity to discuss some of the issues that have been a theme of his presidency and certainly his work together with the Europeans.\nAnd then, with that, he will fly that evening to Germany. Again, we chose to go to Germany for a number of reasons. First, Angela Merkel, who has been, I'd say, the President's closest partner over the course of his entire presidency. She's been there the entire time. They've worked together on almost every issue. They've developed a deep mutual respect, I think, and close friendship as well. So he wanted to see Chancellor Merkel one more time to thank her for her partnership and leadership. And it's also going to be an opportunity for the President to meet with a number of other European leaders who will convene in Berlin -- the leaders of the United Kingdom, France, Italy, as well as Spain. Again, these are our closest partners in Europe, among our closest friends in the world.\nAnd during his time in Germany, they'll have an opportunity to discuss the whole range of issues that we cooperate on with Europe, whether that's the fight against ISIL, the ongoing migration issues, counterterrorism cooperation, next steps in Syria, the situation in Ukraine -- the agenda that we've been working on with Europe, and certainly I'm sure they'll discuss the recent U.S. election.\nThe schedule in Europe, on Thursday, the President will have a bilateral meeting with Chancellor Merkel, and then the two leaders will have a joint press conference, and then that evening, President Obama will have dinner with Chancellor Merkel and have an opportunity to spend some additional time with her.\nAnd then, on Friday, November 18th, in the morning is when the President will meet with the number of European leaders that I mentioned before leaving to fly to Peru for the APEC Summit.\nAt the APEC Summit, the President will have an opportunity to meet with the leaders of countries that have been a focus of our foreign policy through our rebalance in the Asia Pacific, which has included developing commercial ties, economic ties, people-to-people ties, in addition to the security issues that we worked on. APEC, of course, is the venue where we focus on commercial issues.\nGiven the fact that Asia accounts for one-third of global GDP, 40 percent of global economic growth, two-thirds of the global middle class, has four of our top 10 trading partners, five of our key treaty allies, we believe that this region is going to have to be a focus of the United States going forward. And we've invested a lot of time in that and expressed our priority on this region -- the Asia Pacific region.\nIn terms of the schedule in Peru, the President will begin on Saturday, November 19th, with a bilateral meeting with the President of Peru, who has been a strong partner at the beginning of a new administration there. Then that afternoon, as he's done throughout his presidency, the President will have a town hall with young leaders. This is our newest initiative -- Young Leaders initiative -- young Latin American leaders, and so he'll have an opportunity to speak to them.\nThen the President will have a bilateral meeting -- and the two bilateral meetings that we are currently planning for in Peru are with President Xi Jinping of China. This has been one of our most important relationships and most important relationships of the world, and they'll have an opportunity to review the progress that they have made before the President leaves office. And then, likely, the next day we're anticipating a bilateral meeting Prime Minister Turnbull of Australia, again, another one of our closest allies. And just as the rebalance to Asia has depended upon an effective, cooperative relationship with China even as we've had differences, the cornerstone of that rebalance has also been our alliances, and so it will be an important opportunity to check in with Prime Minister Turnbull.\nI would expect that the President will have an opportunity to meet with the TPP leaders as a group while he is in Peru. This is something he's done at previous APEC summits. Obviously we recognize the recent political developments in our country and how that affects TPP, but that's all the more reason for the President to discuss with other TPP leaders the work they've done together and how we're looking at issues related to trade going forward.\nAnd then the night of Saturday, November 19th, the President will attend the Gala Dinner.\nThen Sunday, November 20th, is the APEC Summit, and a range of sessions, and as I mentioned, I think one of the President's bilateral meetings will be that day. And then he will hold a press conference, and that will conclude his trip.\nSo, with that, I don't know, Wally, if you have anything to add on your issues.\nMR. ADEYEMO: Briefly, I'll just add a few words to what Ben has already said about the economic portion of this trip.\nAs you all know, the trip will provide the President with the opportunity to talk with many of our most important economic partners. Europe is, of course -- the EU overall is one of our largest trading partners, and APEC represents over 60 percent of our exports and also 60 percent of our imports.\nIn addition to this, the President worked very closely with a number of these countries and their leaders to break the back of the Great Recession, pulling together a multilateral response that helped to end the recession and to restore the global economy to growth early on in his presidency. And it will give him an opportunity to talk with these leaders not only about the success they had in doing that, but also about the work that they have done and they continue to do to address inequality around the globe.\nIn Europe, the President will, of course, have an opportunity to commend Prime Minister Tsipris on the reforms that he's put in place, but also to acknowledge that more needs to be done in order to ensure that Greece has a path to sustainable growth. As the President has always done, he agrees with the IMF that debt relief is crucial to putting Greece's economy on a sustainable path. And it will be an opportunity for us to talk to Greece about the efforts they're taking to address some of the economic issues that they face with regard to making sure that they're creating jobs and opportunities for their workers and their firms.\nIn Germany, the President will also have an opportunity to talk with Chancellor Merkel about the work they've done together to promote economic growth and also address the challenges that the global economy has faced over the last eight years. And it will also be an opportunity to talk about our trade and investment relationship with the European Union when he sees the various leaders during the trip.\nAPEC will also provide an opportunity for the President to talk about the importance of our economic relationship with countries in the Asia Pacific. As you know, trade reflects America's economic values in a very important way, and that's why the President has signed trade agreements that include high-standard 21st century provisions, including labor and the environment, that ensure a level playing field for American workers and businesses. It will give him an opportunity to talk about why we see that continuing to engage with the Asia Pacific is not only in our economic interest, but also in our national security interest.\nThe TPP agreement that we negotiated with a number of APEC countries reflects our economic values and we continue to believe that entering into agreements like TPP make a great deal of sense for America because it levels the playing field for our workers and firms. And if we are not engaged, other countries will remain engaged. For example, China is continuing to engage on putting forth the RCEP agreement that would be a lower-standard agreement than the TPP agreement, and would give them an opportunity to set the rules of the road for the Asia Pacific.\nSo it would be an opportunity for the President to talk about how we think trade agreements can be used to further our shared economic and national security interests, and to also talk about the global economy at large.\nQ Ben, and for all of you, can you comment just a little bit more about the extent to which the recent election and the results of that election will overshadow this trip, what sort of a message will the President bring to U.S. allies about what a Trump presidency might mean to agreements that they have worked on together, including the Iran deal and the Paris agreement? Can you just give us a sense of what he'll say about that? And also, I just wanted to follow up -- I may have missed this, but is there going to be a big speech in Berlin?\nMR. RHODES: There's not going to be a big speech in Berlin. The speech of the trip is going to be in Greece. That was always our intention.\nLook, we certainly expect that the election will be the primary topic on people's minds everywhere we go. I think, frankly, that would have been the case no matter what the result. But I think that will be more so the case, given the direction that the election took.\nWe have one President at a time, and so President Obama, of course, will be running through the tape on January 20th, working on issues -- including issues like the counter-ISIL campaign, where there's a lot of ongoing work and cooperation with these countries and where we want to, frankly, have a smooth handoff to the next administration as possible. And we are also, as the President has repeatedly said, invested in having a successful and smooth transition to the new team that will determine its own personnel and approaches to a variety of issues.\nLook, there are certain things that have endured for decades under administrations of different parties. The Transatlantic Alliance is certainly one of those. The NATO alliance is certainly one of those. We have taken steps during our time in office to reinforce the NATO alliance, to reassure Eastern European allies, to move significant military personnel and equipment to our Eastern flank to ensure that those nations are reassured, and also to work with NATO as we -- on counterterrorism and deal with refugee flows.\nSo there are many ongoing issues that we're working on that are deeply relevant to our security that we will want to discuss, and, again, agreements and alliances that have perpetuated over decades under administrations of many different stripes.\nOn the couple of issues you mentioned, we certainly know the positions that were taken throughout the course of the campaign. We will, of course, fully continue to implement our commitments under the Iran deal and under the Paris agreement. We will fully brief the incoming team on those agreements. And you all have heard us repeatedly discuss the benefits of those agreements on American national security. We recognize that the incoming administration will make their own determinations about those policies.\nI would note that both of those agreements are not just American agreements, they're international agreements. And so when we speak about the Iran deal, it's not just an agreement between the United States and Iran, it's an agreement between the United States, our European allies, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, China, as well. And it's in a U.N. Security Council resolution. So you are correct that those nations will all have an interest in discussing with us the state of the implementation of the Iran deal.\nAnd our main role in terms of the new administration right now is briefing their team as they're beginning to fill positions and select people on the Iran deal. The same thing would I'd say goes for Paris. Right now, you have a COP meeting taking place in Morocco, so all nations are moving forward with the agreement, which has gone into force.\nAgain, we certainly recognize the positions that have been taken during the campaign. We will continue to fulfill our commitments while President Obama is in office, and we will fully brief the incoming administration on the Paris agreement and our climate policies. And then they will make their own determination.\nSo, again, I'd expect the election to be a subject of conversation and I expect that those two agreements you asked about, Jeff, to certainly be a subject of conversation, given that all the nations were going to are party to one or more of them.\nQ Could you talk about the backdrop of the speech in Greece, and also how the text is being adjusted as a result of Tuesday's results?\nMR. RHODES: So let me get you the precise venue. I don't have it in front of me. It's at a theater in Athens there. But, look, we had not written the speech in advance of the election, so I can't say that we're editing it. I would say that part of what the President will discuss is this need to respond effectively to the issues that have been raised by globalization.\nHe discussed this at length at the United Nations General Assembly, and I think it will be a similar set of issues that he'll want to focus on. And that will include, frankly, acknowledgement of our election results, the Brexit election results, and the sense that we've seen in a number of countries that there are, of course, benefits that have come from globalization and automation, but at the same time, there are challenges as people feel like decisions are made beyond their control, in some cases, as economies change, as inequality has persisted and, in some cases, has grown.\nWe believe in the United States we've made enormous progress in these eight years, climbing out of the enormous economic hole, going from the depths of a Great Recession to years of job creation and economic growth, and narrowing inequality. So we believe that we've set a good direction at home even as we also worked with countries around the world to stabilize the global economy which had been in a free fall, including many of the partners that we'll be meeting with.\nBut at the same time, in the wake of the financial crisis and the challenges presented by technology and globalization and the migration of peoples is clearly something that can be seen in multiple election results, including our own. So even with all the progress we've made, we recognize, no matter what had happened in November that more work needed to be done. And so I think that will be reflected in the President's speech.\nQ I wanted to circle back to Jeff's question and to drill a little deeper on the tone that the President will strike. The President was very open about the fact that in every foreign capital that he went to over the last year or so, every foreign leader, the first question they asked him was Trump, and he said they were rattled by it and offered some pretty dire warnings about what would happen if he was elected. So now that he has been, will the President be reassuring these leaders that things are going to work out, that he won't be as bad as the President indicated that he might be? Or how will he square that, this reality, with the warnings that he gave about Trump prior to Election Day?\nMR. RHODES: We'll, look, in terms of other leaders in other countries, they will speak for themselves. And I think in some cases they're leaders who made clear their own preferences in our election who have since offered their congratulations to the President-elect.\nWhat I'd say is, first and foremost, focused on trying to ensure that his successor gets off to a good start and has the opportunity to succeed. And so, therefore, I think he'll want to use these conversations with leaders to express that view, that given all of the important issues that we face, no matter our preferred choice may have been in the election, right now we as Americans have a stake in seeing this incoming administration succeed, and frankly, the world has a stake in seeing America succeed, given the leadership role that we play. And that's certainly true of our allies.\nOn the issues you discussed, we obviously believe in the importance of the Iran deal, which had significantly rolled back Iran's nuclear program and averts yet another conflict in the Middle East. We believe in the importance of the Paris agreement, which encompasses almost every country in the world and offers an opportunity to fight climate change. So these are issues where our views are well known. We will run through the tape with the implementation of those policies, and then the new team will make their own determinations. And we respect that every administration will make its own judgment.\nAgain, they will do so in the context of these being international agreements, and so it will be important for them to consult with these other countries as well, given that -- if you're just speaking about the Iran deal, our European allies, China and Russia invested in that as well.\nSo we'll want to review the progress of those policies, deliver a message of our commitment to seeing the new administration have a seamless transition and have the opportunity to succeed. And then I think these countries and governments will have their own opportunities to -- and in some cases, they already have -- make contact with the President-elect and his team as he gets onboard.\nQ It will not surprise you that I also want to talk about Donald Trump. A lot of my questions have been answered. But the President did, of course, meet for an hour and a half, roughly, with Mr. Trump yesterday. And I'm wondering whether there's anything that he gleaned from those meetings or that he perhaps talked about on purpose so that he would be able to give some indications or reassurances to world leaders. And if you could read that out.\nAnd also, I know to some extent the President believes that Donald Trump has had views that have changed over the years, or even over the months or weeks, and I'm wondering whether that is part of the message of reassurance to world leaders to the extent that just because he said something in the election doesn't mean it's true, or whether you think that would not reassure world leaders and, therefore, he should not say that. Thanks.\nMR. RHODES: Look, I certainly don't want to speak for the\n-- look, what I'd say is, in terms of their conversation, they did touch on a range of foreign policy issues, and the President did express that he'd be seeing a number of these foreign leaders. Again, I wouldn't want to characterize any messages. The President is going on behalf of the United States and his office, and the President-elect will speak for himself in terms of his interactions with foreign leaders.\nI think the main focus of their conversation, again, without getting into any specific issues, was just determining how to make the best use of this transition period, to fully brief up the President-elect and his team as it's elected on these issues, because there are a diverse array of challenges, there's a great deal of complexity in how we're dealing with the terrorist threat, how we're implementing the Iran deal, how the situation in Syria is unfolding, as well as the issues in Europe related to the refugees and NATO.\nSo, again, I think the focus of their conversation was on getting an initial discussion around the strategic landscape in the world today, and then initiating a process wherein we'll be making information available to the President-elect and his team about those issues.\nSo, again, I think President Obama will be speaking for himself and for the office of the presidency. I do think he can convey obviously that the United States of America fulfills its commitments through democratic transitions and through different administrations.\nSo, even as we've had a diverse foreign policy as pursued by administrations of different parties, we've remained committed members of the NATO Alliance, and we've kept treaty commitments. And so there's a baseline of shared interest and values that has continued under different administrations even as different approaches have been taken and different emphases have been given to different issues. And so I think the President can reinforce the importance of the core relationships for the United States and the world, including with many of the countries he'll be visiting.\nQ So let me just follow up on that and ask, what are the goals the President in his meeting with Donald Trump yesterday -- to glean from him where he stands right now on some of these key issues, knowing that there will be great interest in his conversation with world leaders on this trip?\nAnd when you say that you're going to run through the tape, we know, for example, that when you're talking about a domestic issue like the ACA, if they can during this open enrollment period run up the number of people who are signed up -- the more people you have who would be affected by repeal, the tougher it becomes, the more complicated it becomes for the other side. And so I'm wondering with issues like the Iran deal and the Paris agreement, and how complex they are, are there things that you can push for when you say run out the tape that you think will essentially help your side, help your view of how these things continue to be in play and get implemented?\nMR. RHODES: Well, look, I'd say a couple of things on what I was referring to. First of all, we want to continue to do our jobs as effectively as we can. National security -- global events and our national security doesn't change with the political calendar. So we have an ongoing campaign underway to retake Mosul. We have a very aggressive effort to prepare for efforts to isolate Raqqa. So the counter-ISIL campaign has been making steady progress, and we want to continue that and, frankly, hand that off in as good as shape as possible to the incoming administration. So there's just some ongoing work that needs to be done to make sure we're doing everything we can to keep the country safe to respond to world events and to do the business of governing.\nSecond, part of running through the tape is transition and how do we brief up the new team. And I think as officials are chosen, Cabinet officials are chose, National Security Council officials are chosen, we have every intention of doing whatever we can to help them succeed to provide them with the information they need to understand the current strategic landscape and the approaches that we're taking, to understand the nature of the threats that we face and that they are likely to face in the coming months and years. And so transition is going to be the critical component of that.\nAnd then, look, on the issues that you mentioned, what I'd say is, we just want to fully and faithfully continue to implement them. We fully recognize that the new administration will be responsible for these and all other issues after the transition of power. That's how our democracy works. I think we have made clear that we believe in the benefits of these approaches, again, on the Iran deal, on the Paris agreement. And again, the only other thing I'd say is it's important to note that they are international agreements as well.\nAnd so these other countries who are party to these agreements have a significant interest in working with us while we're still in office to see that they're being successfully pursued. In Paris, that's happening right now at the COP conference in Morocco. In terms of the Iran deal, we'll be meeting with three of the countries that are party to it in Germany. And we'll want to ensure that we're successful at implementing that agreement through our time in office, and then the new administration will make their own determinations.\nSo that's how I'd describe our approach to the coming two months.\nQ You mentioned earlier that the President plans to meet in Peru with the leaders of the TPP countries. What will be his message to them? I mean, we've heard from Capitol Hill that it's pretty much dead. What will the President and try to communicate to these TPP countries? And do you disagree that it's dead?\nMR. RHODES. Wally, you want to take a first stab at that?\nMR. ADEYEMO: Yeah, maybe I will. And I think what the President is going to say to them is what we've been saying in public, which is that we recognize that trade benefits the United States of America. APEC in and of itself represents the countries -- they represent over 60 percent of our exports and also 60 percent of our imports. We still think the TPP makes sense for America for economic and national security reasons, and that it's important that we stay engaged in the region. And he will talk to them about the importance of that engagement, and talk about how we can work together over the course of the remaining days of this administration to solidify the partnership with those countries.\nIn terms of the TPP agreement itself, Leader McConnell has spoken to that and it's something that he's going to work with the President-elect to figure out where they go in terms of trade agreements in the future. But we continue to think that these types of deals make sense, simply because countries like China are not going to stop working on regional agreements. As I mentioned earlier, they're continuing to work on RCEP and on signing trade agreements that would lower the standards in the Asia Pacific that would make it harder for our firms and our workers to compete on a level playing field, which we think is ultimately important to growing our economy.\nThe majority of the world's middle class, the larger percentage of the world economy exists in the Asia Pacific, and it's going to be important that America continue to compete there on a level playing field.\nMR. RHODES: I don't think I have anything to add on that other than to say that, again, these have been TPP parties and trading partners in their own right, and the President can review the work we've done with them. We're clear-eyed about the current situation, but we believe what we believe about the value of trade and the importance of the Asia Pacific region to the United States. And I think given its size and importance, it's going to have to continue to be a focus for the next President and Congress going forward no matter what.\nWe'll wrap with that. On a personal note, having I don't know how many of these preview calls I've done and briefings, having gone on just about every one of the President's foreign trips and worked with all of you, or many of you -- so I look forward to one last trip with you guys, barring some unforeseen event. And we'll keep you updated going forward.\n11:39 A.M.

Joining Forces works to inspire, educate and encourage action from both the public and private sectors to ensure that service members, veterans, and their families have the tools they need to succeed throughout their lives.\nThe last Veteran's Day of this Administration provides an opportunity to celebrate the progress Joining Forces has made in bringing attention to the unique strengths and needs of America's military families, while highlighting their skills, experience and dedication—encouraging greater connections between the American public and the military that will continue into the future.\nEmployment\nSince the launch of Joining Forces, the unemployment rate for our 9/11 generation of veterans has been reduced from more than 12 percent to lower than the national average today. Employers ranging from smaller start-ups to some of the largest corporations in the world have hired or trained more than 1.5 million veterans and military spouses. In May 2016, the First Lady announced commitments to hire and train 170,000 new veteran and military spouse in high-growth sectors, including aerospace, telecommunications and technology. In addition, 15 companies and organizations have committed to lead training programs, sponsor scholarships, and support certification courses for more than 60,000 veterans and military spouses over the next five years.\nIn addition, the creation of the Military Spouse Employment Partnership, a network that now includes more than 335 companies, has led to the hiring of 100,000 military spouses through postings on the Military Spouse Employment Partnership Career Portal and mentoring of military spouses. The Partnership also provides employment data on military spouses hired.\nJoining Forces also issued a call to action to all 50 U.S. governors to take executive and/or legislative action to streamline state licensing for the military community, and today, all 50 states have taken action to support the military community by making it easier for military spouses to overcome barriers to employment. In collaboration with state legislators and regulators, Joining Forces and the U.S. Department of Defense have helped states adopt simple measures to accommodate the demands of the military and support military spouses as they seek to continue their careers.\nEducation\nSince 2011, more than 100 colleges and universities have signed the \"Educate the Educators\" commitment, which prepares educators to lead classrooms and develop cultures that are more responsive to the social, emotional, and academic needs of military-connected children. In addition, all 50 states have signed on to the Military Child Education Compact, which focuses on the inequities facing school children of military parents when they are required to relocate across state lines.\nIn April 2014, Dr. Biden helped launch the VA GI Bill Comparison Tool, a website that allows service members and dependents using the GI Bill to research tuition and fees, housing allowances and book stipends, as well as graduation rates and loan default rates for each school so that they may make an informed decision on next steps.\nIn April of 2016, the National Math and Science Initiative's (NMSI) College Readiness Program fulfilled a commitment made during the launch of Joining Forces in 2011 to expand into 200 military-connected schools, providing more than 60,000 military-connected students with the support and educational opportunities they deserve. Through its College Readiness Program, NMSI is broadening access to rigorous AP coursework in math, science, and English and equipping students with the knowledge and skills they need to graduate from high school ready for college and the STEM-intensive careers of the 21st century.\nWellness\nTo call upon cities, counties and states to commit to ending and preventing homelessness among veterans in their communities, the First Lady issued  The Mayors Challenge to End Veteran Homelessness in June 2014. As a result, 35 communities and the states of Connecticut and Virginia have effectively ended veteran homelessness.\nThe First Lady also launched the Campaign to Change Direction in March 2015—a nationwide mental health public awareness campaign to promote education and awareness of mental health issues affecting the military community. The Change Direction initiative is a collection of concerned citizens, nonprofit leaders, and leaders from the private sector who have come together to change America's perception of mental health, mental illness, and wellness. More than 230 partner organizations have joined the campaign.\nIn addition, more than 100 Association of American Medical College (AAMC)-member medical schools across the country signed a pledge recognizing the sacrifice and commitment of current and returning military service members. AAMC and the Center for Deployment Psychology now produce Joining Forces Wellness Week, a week-long series of interactive trainings for clinical and non-clinical wellness professionals focused on specific health and wellness issues of veterans, service members, and their families.", "timestamp": "2016-11-11", "title": "Fact Sheet: Five Years of Joining Forces - A Call to Action to Americans to Support Service Members, Veterans and Their Families"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "The President spoke at 11:38 a.m. in the Memorial Amphitheater at Arlington National Cemetery. In his remarks, he referred to Patrick K. Hallinan, Superintendent, Arlington National Cemetery; Debbera M. Ransom, founder and commander, Johnetta R. Cole AMVETS Post No. 24 in Buffalo, NY; and Evanston, IL, resident Irving Lerner, and his children Rita, David, and Carole D. Lerner and Susan Ricker.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119602", "text": "Thank you very much. Please—thank you. Thank you. Please—thank you.\nSecretary McDonald, Mr. Hallinan, distinguished guests and, most of all, our extraordinary veterans and your families: The last time I stood on these hallowed grounds, on Memorial Day, our country came together to honor those who have fought and died for our flag. A few days before, our Nation observed Armed Forces Day, honoring all who are serving under that flag at this moment.\nAnd today, on Veterans Day, we honor those who honored our country with its highest form of service: You who once wore the uniform of our Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, or Coast Guard. We owe you our thanks, we owe you our respect, and we owe you our freedom.\nWe come together to express our profound gratitude for the sacrifices and contributions you and your family made on the battlefield, at home, and at outposts around the world. But America's gratitude to our veterans is something always grounded in something greater than what you did on duty. It's also an appreciation of the example that you continue to set after your service has ended: your example as citizens.\nVeterans Day often follows a hard-fought political campaign, an exercise in the free speech and self-government that you fought for. It often lays bare disagreements across our Nation. But the American instinct has never been to find isolation in opposite corners. It is to find strength in our common creed, to forge unity from our great diversity, to sustain that strength and unity even when it is hard. And when the election is over, as we search for ways to come together—to reconnect with one another and with the principles that are more enduring than transitory politics—some of our best examples are the men and women we salute on Veterans Day.\nIt's the example of young Americans—our 9/11 generation—who, as first responders, ran into smoldering towers, then ran to a recruiting center and signed up to serve. It's the example of a military that meets every mission, one united team, all looking out for one another, all getting each other's backs. It's the example of the single most diverse institution in our country: soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coastguardsmen who represent every corner of our country, every shade of humanity, immigrant and native-born, Christian, Muslim, Jew, and nonbeliever alike, all forged into common service.\nIt's the example of our veterans—patriots—who, when they take off their fatigues, put back on the camouflage of everyday life in America and become our business partners and bosses, our teachers and our coaches, our first responders, city council members, community leaders, role models, all still serving this country we love with the same sense of duty and with valor.\nA few years ago, a middle school student from Missouri entered an essay contest about why veterans are special. This is what he wrote: \"When I think of a veteran, I think of men or women who will be the first to help an elderly lady across the street. I also think of someone who will defend everyone, regardless of their race, age, gender, hair color, or other discriminations.\" [Laughter] After 8 years in office, I particularly appreciate that he included hair color. [Laughter] But that middle schooler is right. Our veterans are still the first to help, still the first to serve.\nThey are women like the retired military policewoman from Buffalo who founded an AMVETS post in her community and is now building a safe place for homeless female veterans with children. They are men like the two veterans from Tennessee—one in his fifties, one in his sixties—who wrote me to say they would happily suit up and ship out if we needed them. \"We might be just a little old,\" they wrote, \"but we will be proud to go and do what we were taught to do.\" Whenever the world makes you cynical, whenever you seek true humility and selflessness, look to a veteran.\nLook to someone like First Lieutenant Irving Lerner. Irving was born in Chicago to Russian Jewish immigrants during World War I. He served as a bombardier in the Army Air Corps, flying dozens of missions toward the end of World War II.\nWhen he returned home, Irving did what a lot of veterans do. He put his medals away, he kept humble about his service, started living a quiet life. One fall day, walking down Sheffield Avenue on Chicago's North Side, a stranger stopped him. He said, \"Thank you for your service,\" and he handed him a ticket to see the Cubs play in the World Series. [Laughter] Now, it's a good thing Irving took that ticket—[laughter]—because it would be a while until his next chance. [Laughter]\nIrving worked hard, managing the warehouses for his brother-in-law's tire company. He got married, to a sergeant in the Women's Air Corps, no less. He raised four children, the oldest of whom, Susan, is celebrating her 71st birthday today. And on a June morning many years ago, another one of Irving's daughters, Carole, called to check in. Her mother answered but was in a rush. \"We can't talk,\" she said, \"your father is being honored and we're late.\" Carole asked, \"Honored for what?\" And the answer came: for his heroism in the skies above Normandy exactly 50 years earlier.\nYou see, Irving's children never knew that their father flew over those French beachheads on D-day. He never mentioned it. Now when they call to check in, his children always say, \"Thank you for saving the world.\" [Laughter] And Irving, sharp as ever at a hundred years young, always replies, \"Well, I had a little help.\" [Laughter]\nWhenever the world makes you cynical, whenever you doubt that courage and goodness and selflessness is possible, then stop and look to a veteran. They don't always go around telling stories of their heroism, so it's up to us to ask and to listen, to tell those stories for them, and to live in our own lives the values for which they were prepared to give theirs.\nIt's up to us to make sure they always get the care that they need. As Bob mentioned, when I announced my candidacy for this office almost a decade ago, I recommitted this generation to that work. And we've increased funding for veterans by more than 85 percent. We've cut veteran homelessness almost in half. Today, more veterans have access to health care and fewer are unemployed. We helped disabled veterans afford prosthetics. We're delivering more mental health care services to more veterans than ever before, because we know that not all wounds of war are visible.\nTogether, we began this work. Together, we must continue to keep that sacred trust with our veterans and honor their good work with our own, knowing that our mission is never done. It is still a tragedy that 20 veterans a day take their own lives. We have to get them the help they need. We have to keep solving problems like long wait times at the VA. We have to keep cutting the disability claims backlog. We have to resist any effort to outsource and privatize the health care we owe America's veterans.\nOn Veterans Day, we acknowledge, humbly, that we can never serve our veterans in quite the same way that they served us. But we can try. We can practice kindness. We can pay it forward. We can volunteer. We can serve. We can respect one another. We can always get each other's backs.\nThat is what Veterans Day asks all of us to think about. The person you pass as you walk down the street might not be wearing our Nation's uniform today. But consider for a moment that a year or a decade or a generation ago, he or she might have been one of our fellow citizens who was willing to lay down their life for strangers like us. And we can show how much we love our country by loving our neighbors as ourselves.\nMay God bless all who served and still do. And may God bless the United States of America.", "timestamp": "2016-11-11", "title": "Remarks at a Veterans Day Ceremony in Arlington, Virginia"}

This weekend, as we search for ways to bridge our differences, we look to the principles that are more enduring than politics. And some of the best examples are found in the men and women we saluted yesterday and every day: our troops and our veterans.\nIt is the example of young Americans—our 9/11 generation—who, as first responders ran into smoldering towers, ran to a recruiting center, and signed up to serve. It's the example of a military that meets every mission, one united team, all looking out for one another, all getting each other's backs. It is the example of the single most diverse institution in our country: soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coastguardsmen who represent every corner of our country, every shade of humanity, immigrant and native-born, Christian, Muslim, Jew, and nonbeliever alike, all forged into common service.\nIt is the example of veterans—patriots—who, when they take off their fatigues, put back on the camouflage of everyday life in America, becoming small-businesspeople and teachers and coaches, our first responders and city council members and neighborhood role models, all still serving this country we love with the same sense of duty and valor.\nOur veterans don't always go around telling stories of their heroism. So it is up to us to ask, to listen, to tell those stories for them, and to live in our own lives the values for which they were prepared to give theirs. It's up to us to summon some of the courage and humility of our veterans and to acknowledge that we can never serve them in quite the same way that they serve us.\nBut we can try. We need to keep working to make sure they always get the care and benefits they've earned. We can practice kindness. We can volunteer, serve, and respect one another. We can always get each other's backs. And we can show how much we love our country by loving our neighbors as ourselves.\nTo all of you who served and who still do: thank you.

{"author": "Donald J. Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119651", "text": "Stahl: Well, congratulations, Mr. Trump.\nPresident-elect Trump: Thank you.\nStahl: You're president-elect.\nPresident-elect Trump: Thank you.\nStahl: How surprised were you?\nPresident-elect Trump: Well, I really felt we were doing well. I was on a string of about 21 straight days of speeches, sometimes many a day and the last two days I really-- I really had a pretty wild time. I did six speeches and then I did seven and--\nStahl: But everyone thought you were going to lose.\nPresident-elect Trump: I know, I did my final speech in Michigan at 1:00 in the morning and we had 31,000 people, many people outside of the arena. And I felt-- when I left, I said, \"How are we gonna lose?\" We set it up a day before. And we had all of these people. And it was literally at 1:00 in the morning and I said, \"This doesn't look like second place.\" So we were really happy, I mean, it was-- these are great people.\nStahl: On election night, I heard you went completely silent. Was it a sort of realization of the enormity of this thing for you?\nPresident-elect Trump: I think so, it's enormous. I've done a lotta big things, I've never done anything like this. It is so big, it is so-- it's so enormous, it's so amazing.\nStahl: It kind of just took your breath away? Couldn't talk?\nPresident-elect Trump: A li-- a little bit, a little bit. And I think-- I realized that this is a whole different life for me now.\nStahl: Hillary called you. Tell us about that phone call.\nPresident-elect Trump: So Hillary called and it was a lovely call and it was a tough call for her, I mean, I can imagine. Tougher for her than it would have been for me. And for me, it would have been very, very difficult. She couldn't have been nicer. She just said, \"Congratulations, Donald, well done.\" And I said, \"I want to thank you very much, you were a great competitor.\" She is very strong and very smart.\nStahl: What about Bill Clinton? Did you talk to him?\nPresident-elect Trump: He did, he called the next day.\nStahl: Really? What did he say?\nPresident-elect Trump: He actually called last night.\nStahl: What did he say?\nPresident-elect Trump: And he-- he couldn't have been more gracious. He said it was an amazing run. One of the most amazing he's ever seen.\nStahl: He said that.\nPresident-elect Trump: He was very, very -- really, very nice.\nStahl: It was a pretty nasty campaign. Do you regret any of the things you said about her?\nPresident-elect Trump: Well, it was a double-side nasty.\nPresident-elect Trump: I mean they were tough and I was tough and-- do I regret? I mean, I'm sitting here with you now and we're gonna do a great job for the country. We're going to make America great again, I mean, that's what-- it-- it began with that and that's where we are right now. There are so many--\nStahl: So no-- no regrets about--\nPresident-elect Trump: I can't regret. No-- I wish it were softer, I wish it were nicer, I wish maybe even it was more on policy, or whatever you want to say. But-- but I will say that-- it really-- it really is something that I'm very proud of I mean it was a tremendous campaign.\nStahl: Can we talk about yesterday with President Obama?\nPresident-elect Trump: Sure.\nStahl: 90 minutes. You were scheduled for what? 15?\nPresident-elect Trump: 15 max.\nPresident-elect Trump: This was just going to be a quick little chat and it lasted close to an hour and a half. And it could have gone on for four hours. I mean it was-- just-- in fact, it was almost hard breaking it up because we had so many things to say. And he told me-- the good things and the bad things, there are things that are tough right now--\nStahl: Like what?\nPresident-elect Trump: Well…\nStahl: Give us some meat.\nPresident-elect Trump: Well, look I don't want to divulge, but we talked about the Middle East, that's tough. It's a tough situation. I wanted to get his full view and I got his, you know I got a good part of his view.\nStahl: Uh-huh.\nPresident-elect Trump: And I like having that because I'm going to be inheriting that in a short period of time. I found him to be terrific. I found him to be-- very smart and very nice. Great sense of humor, as much as you can have a sense of humor talking about tough subjects, but we were talking about some pretty tough subjects.\nPresident-elect Trump:–and we were talking about some victories, also, some things that-- that he feels very good about. But--\nStahl: Like--\nPresident-elect Trump: Well, what I really wanted to focus on was-- the Middle East, North Korea, Obamacare is tough. You know, healthcare is a tough situation.\nStahl: Oh, I bet he asked you not to undo it.\nPresident-elect Trump: Well, he didn't ask me, no, he told me-- you know, the merits and the difficulties. And we understand that.\nStahl: You looked pretty sober sitting there in the Oval Office, did something wash over you or--\nPresident-elect Trump: No, I think I'm a sober person. I think the press tries to make you into something a little bit different. In my case, a little bit of a wild man. I'm not. I'm actually not. I'm a very sober person. But it was respect for the office, it was respect for the president. Again, I never met him before, but we had-- we had a very good chemistry going. And-- and I really found—it might not be that I agree with him, but I really found the conversation unbelievably interesting.\nStahl: Was it at all awkward, at all, given what you've said about each other? You said he was not born in this country, he said things about you, he said you're-- unqualified--\nPresident-elect Trump: You know what, it was a very-- it was a very interesting thing because-- I mean, few people have asked me from my family, what was that first period of time like?\nStahl: Yeah.\nPresident-elect Trump: We never discussed what was said about each other. I said terrible things about him, he said terrible things about me. We never ever discussed what we said about each other—\nStahl: There was no awkwardness?\nPresident-elect Trump: I'll be honest, from my standpoint zero, zero. And that's strange. I'm actually surprised to tell you that. It's-- you know, a little bit strange.\nStahl: Do you think that-- that your election is a repudiation of his presidency?\nPresident-elect Trump: No, I think it's a moment in time where politicians for a long period of time have let people down. They've let 'em down on the job front. They've even let 'em down in terms of the war front. You know, we've been fighting this war for 15 years--\nStahl: This was the message of your campaign.\nPresident-elect Trump: We've spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, $6 trillion, we could have rebuilt our country twice. And you look at our roads and our bridges and our tunnels and all of the-- and our airports are, like, obsolete. And I think it was just a repudiation of what's been taking place over a longer period of time than that.\nStahl: You know, you surprised everyone by winning the primaries, beating 17 other Republicans or 16, whatever-- people are really surprised that you won this election. Are people going to be surprised about how you conduct yourself as president?\nPresident-elect Trump: You know, I'll conduct myself-- in a very good manner, but depends on what the situation is, sometimes you have to be rougher. When I look at-- when I look at the world and you look at how various places are taking advantage of our country, and I say it, and I say it very proudly, it's going to be America first. It's not going to be what we're doing—we, we've lost-- we're losing this country. We're losing this country. That's why I won the election. And by the way, won it easily, I mean I won easily. That was big, big.\nStahl: Are you going to sometimes have that same rhetoric that you had on the stump? Or are you going to reign it in?\nPresident-elect Trump: Well, sometimes you need a certain rhetoric to get people motivated. I don't want to be just a little nice monotone character and in many cases I will be.\nStahl: Can you be?\nPresident-elect Trump: Sure I can. I can be easily, that's easier. Honestly to do that, it's easier.\nStahl: So let's go through very quickly some of the promises you made and tell us if you're going to do what you said or you're going to change it in any way. Are you really going to build a wall?\nPresident-elect Trump: Yes.\nStahl: They're talking about a fence in the Republican Congress, would you accept a fence?\nPresident-elect Trump: For certain areas I would, but certain areas, a wall is more appropriate. I'm very good at this, it's called construction.\nStahl: So part wall, part fence?\nPresident-elect Trump: Yeah, it could be – it could be some fencing.\nStahl: What about the pledge to deport millions and millions of undocumented immigrants?\nPresident-elect Trump: What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, we have a lot of these people, probably two million, it could be even three million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate. But we're getting them out of our country, they're here illegally. After the border is secured and after everything gets normalized, we're going to make a determination on the people that you're talking about who are terrific people, they're terrific people but we are gonna make a determination at that-- But before we make that determination-- Lesley, it's very important, we want to secure our border.\nStahl: So you were with Paul Ryan, you met with the Republican leadership, what was the-- one thing that you all agreed you want to get done right away?\nPresident-elect Trump: Well, I would say there was more than one thing, there were three things, it was healthcare, there was immigration and there was a major tax bill lowering taxes in this country. We're going to substantially simplify and lower the taxes--\nStahl: And you've got both Houses?\nPresident-elect Trump: And I have both Houses and we have the presidency, so we can do things--\nStahl: You can do things lickety-split.\nPresident-elect Trump: It's been a long time since it's happened.\nPresident-elect Trump: And they gave me a lot of credit. Don't forget, I was abused four or five weeks ago, they said I was going to-- instead of having all three, we would lose all three. So that was good. But those are the three things that we really discussed.\nStahl: You said that lobbyists owned politicians because they give them money.\nPresident-elect Trump: Yeah.\nStahl: You admitted you used to do it yourself. You have a transition team—\nPresident-elect Trump: And when you say lobbyists, lobbyists and special interests.\nStahl: And you want to get rid of all of that?\nPresident-elect Trump: I don't like it, no.\nStahl: You don't like it, but your own transition team, it's filled with lobbyists.\nPresident-elect Trump: That's the only people you have down there.\nStahl: You have lobbyists from Verizon, you have lobbyists from the oil gas industry, you have food lobby.\nPresident-elect Trump: Sure. Everybody's a lobbyist down there--\nStahl: Well, wait\nPresident-elect Trump: That's what they are. They're lobbyists or special interests—\nStahl: On your own transition team.\nPresident-elect Trump:–we are trying to clean up Washington. Look--\nStahl: How can you claim--\nPresident-elect Trump: Everything, everything down there-- there are no people-- there are all people that work -- that's the problem with the system, the system. Right now, we're going to clean it up. We're having restrictions on foreign money coming in, we're going to put on term limits, which a lot of people aren't happy about, but we're putting on term limits. We're doing a lot of things to clean up the system. But everybody that works for government, they then leave government and they become a lobbyist, essentially. I mean, the whole place is one big lobbyist.\nStahl: But you're, but you're basically saying you have to rely on them, even though you want to get rid of them?\nPresident-elect Trump: I'm saying that they know the system right now, but we're going to phase that out. You have to phase it out.\nStahl: Let's talk about your cabinet.\nPresident-elect Trump: OK.\nStahl: Have you made any decisions?\nPresident-elect Trump: Yes.\nStahl: Tell us.\nPresident-elect Trump: Well, I can't tell you that, but I have made--\nStahl: Oh, come on—\nPresident-elect Trump: You know the amazing thing to show you the incredible nature of our country. First of all, every major leader and probably less than major le- has called me, I've spoken to many of them and I'll call the rest of them, but and I said, \"Boy, this really shows you how powerful our country is.\" France and U.K. and I mean everybody, all over Asia—and very, just to congratulate. But it really shows the power of our country.\nStahl: One of the things you're going to obviously get an opportunity to do, is name someone to the Supreme Court. And I assume you'll do that quickly?\nPresident-elect Trump: Yes. Very important.\nStahl: During the campaign, you said that you would appoint justices who were against abortion rights. Will you appoint-- are you looking to appoint a justice who wants to overturn Roe v. Wade?\nPresident-elect Trump: So look, here's what's going to happen-- I'm going to-- I'm pro-life. The judges will be pro-life. They'll be very—\nStahl: But what about overturning this law--\nPresident-elect Trump: Well, there are a couple of things. They'll be pro-life, they'll be-- in terms of the whole gun situation, we know the Second Amendment and everybody's talking about the Second Amendment and they're trying to dice it up and change it, they're going to be very pro-Second Amendment. But having to do with abortion if it ever were overturned, it would go back to the states. So it would go back to the states and--\nStahl: Yeah, but then some women won't be able to get an abortion?\nPresident-elect Trump: No, it'll go back to the states.\nStahl: By state—no some --\nPresident-elect Trump: Yeah.\nPresident-elect Trump: Yeah, well, they'll perhaps have to go, they'll have to go to another state.\nStahl: And that's OK?\nPresident-elect Trump: Well, we'll see what happens. It's got a long way to go, just so you understand. That has a long, long way to go.\nStahl: Are you in any way intimidated, scared about this enormous burden, the gravity of what you're taking on?\nPresident-elect Trump: No.\nStahl: Not at all?\nPresident-elect Trump: I respect it. But I'm not scared by it.\nStahl: Now you're not scared, but there are people, Americans, who are scared and some of them are demonstrating right now, demonstrating against you, against your rhetoric--\nPresident-elect Trump: That's only because they don't know me. I really believe that's only because--\nStahl: Well, they listened to you in the campaign and that's--\nPresident-elect Trump: I just don't think they know me.\nStahl: Well, what do you think they're demonstrating against?\nPresident-elect Trump: Well, I think in some cases, you have professional protesters. And we had it-- if you look at WikiLeaks, we had--\nStahl: You think those people down there are—\nPresident-elect Trump: Well Lesley—\nStahl: are professional?\nPresident-elect Trump: Oh, I think some of them will be professional, yeah--\nStahl: OK, but what about – they're in every city.\nStahl: When they demonstrate against you and there are signs out there, I mean, don't you say to yourself, I guess you don't, you know, do I have to worry about this? Do I have to go out and assuage them? Do I have to tell them not to be afraid? They're afraid.\nPresident-elect Trump: I would tell them don't be afraid, absolutely.\nStahl: But that's not what you're saying, I said it-\nPresident-elect Trump: Oh, I think, no, no, I think-- I am saying it, I've been saying it.\nStahl: OK.\nPresident-elect Trump: Don't be afraid. We are going to bring our country back. But certainly, don't be afraid. You know, we just had an election and sort of like you have to be given a little time. I mean, people are protesting. If Hillary had won and if my people went out and protested, everybody would say, \"Oh, that's a terrible thing.\" And it would have been a much different attitude. There is a different attitude. You know, there is a double standard here.\n[Stahl raises the issue of ongoing protests]\nPresident-elect Trump: I am very surprised to hear that-- I hate to hear that, I mean I hate to hear that--\nStahl: But you do hear it?\nPresident-elect Trump: I don't hear it—I saw, I saw one or two instances…\nStahl: On social media?\nPresident-elect Trump: But I think it's a very small amount. Again, I think it's--\nStahl: Do you want to say anything to those people?\nPresident-elect Trump: I would say don't do it, that's terrible, 'cause I'm gonna bring this country together.\nStahl: They're harassing Latinos, Muslims--\nPresident-elect Trump: I am so saddened to hear that. And I say, \"Stop it.\" If it-- if it helps. I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: Stop it.\nStahl: I want to ask you about the tweet that you put out, I think it was last night or the night before, about these demonstrators.\nPresident-elect Trump: Yeah.\nStahl: You said that they were professionals—and you said it was unfair.\nPresident-elect Trump: I said some of them. Some of them are --\nStahl: But are you going to be tweeting and whatever you're upset about just put out there when you're president?\nPresident-elect Trump: So it's a modern form of communication, between Face-- you know, Facebook and Twitter and I guess Instagram, I have 28 million people. 28 million people--\nStahl: So you are going to keep it up?\nPresident-elect Trump: It's a great form of communication. Now, do I say I'll give it up entirely and throw out, that's a tremendous form-- I pick up-- I'm picking up now, I think I picked up yesterday 100,000 people. I'm not saying I love it, but it does get the word out. When you give me a bad story or when you give me an inaccurate story or when somebody other than you and another network, or whatever, 'cause of course, CBS would never do a thing like that right? I have a method of fighting back. That's very tough--\nStahl: But you're going to do that as president?\nPresident-elect Trump: I'm going to do very restrained, if I use it at all, I'm going to do very restrained. I find it tremendous. It's a modern form of communication. There should be nothing you should be ashamed of. It's-- it's where it's at. I-- I do believe this, I really believe that, um-- the fact that I have such power in terms of numbers with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, et cetera, I think it helped me win all of these races where they're spending much more money than I spent. You know, I spent my money. A lot of my money. And I won. I think that social media has more power than the money they spent, and I think maybe to a certain extent, I proved that.\nStahl: Are you going to ask for a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton over her emails? And are you, as you had said to her face, going to try and put her in jail?\nPresident-elect Trump: Well, I'll tell you what I'm going to do, I'm going to think about it. Um, I feel that I want to focus on jobs, I want to focus on healthcare, I want to focus on the border and immigration and doing a really great immigration bill. We want to have a great immigration bill. And I want to focus on all of these other things that we've been talking about.\nStahl: You-- you know, you--\nPresident-elect Trump: And get the country straightened away.\nStahl: You called her \"crooked Hillary,\" said you wanted to get in jail, your people in your audiences kept saying, \"Lock em' up.\"\nPresident-elect Trump: Yeah. She did--\nStahl: Do you—\nPresident-elect Trump: She did some bad things, I mean she did some bad things--\nStahl: I know, but a special prosecutor? You think you might…\nPresident-elect Trump: I don't want to hurt them. I don't want to hurt them. They're, they're good people. I don't want to hurt them. And I will give you a very, very good and definitive answer the next time we do 60 Minutes together.\nStahl: You know, I asked your husband if he was at all intimidated and scared about what lies ahead. The enormity. You're about to be first lady. Are you a little nervous about it? Little tense? A little--\nMrs. Trump: Well, there is a lot of responsibilities. And it's-- a lot of work needs to be done. And-- it's-- your-- stuff on your shoulders. And-- we will take care of it-- day by day. I will stay true to myself. I'm very strong and um-- tough and confident. And I will listen myself and I will do what is right and what feels to my heart.\nStahl: What kind of a first lady do you think she's going to be?\nPresident-elect Trump: She will be terrific. She is very strong and very confident, but she's very warm. And I think she'll have a platform where she'll really be able to do a lot of good. And that's what she wants to do.\nStahl: You know, first ladies usually have a cause. And you've already said you're interested in speaking out against bullying on social media.\nMrs. Trump: I think it's very important because a lot of children and teenagers are getting hurt. And we need to teach them how to talk to each other, how to treat each other and to, to be able to connect with each other on the right way.\nIt's an ironic choice since her own husband sent out a stream of pretty nasty tweets during the campaign.\nStahl: What about your husband's tweeting?\nMrs. Trump: Well, sometimes he -- it got him in trouble. But it helped a lot as well. He had unbelievable following.\nStahl: So you never say to him, \"Come on\"?\nMrs. Trump: I did.\nPresident-elect Trump: She does--\nMrs. Trump: I--\nMrs. Trump: You know, of course, I did many times, from the beginning of the campaign. But…\nStahl: Does he listen to you?\nMrs. Trump: Sometimes he listens, sometimes he doesn't--\nPresident-elect Trump: I'm not a big tweeter. I mean, I don't do too many, but they hit home. And they have to get a point across.\nStahl: If he does something that you think crossed a line, will you tell him?\nMrs. Trump: Yes, I tell him all the time.\nStahl: All the time?\nMrs. Trump: All the time.\nStahl: And does--\nMrs. Trump: And--\nStahl: --he listen? Does he--\nMrs. Trump: I think he hears me. But he will do what he wants to do on the end. He's an adult. He knows the consequences. And I give him my opinion. And he could do whatever he likes with it.\nStahl: Did you ask Melania sort of, for permission, in a way, to run for president? Did you get her approval?\nPresident-elect Trump: Well, I actually sat down with Melania and my whole family and we talked about it. Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany. Barron to a lesser extent, but Barron too. Um, because in a way he's affected every bit as much. Maybe more.\nStahl: Maybe more.\nPresident-elect Trump: And so we all had a dinner and I said, \"I would like to do this. I think I can do a great job.\" And I wanted to get, number one, a consensus and number two, ideally, their permission. And they all agreed.\nStahl: Your son Barron, what is he, 10?\nMrs. Trump: 10.\nStahl: 10. He was on camera the whole time you were giving your acceptance speech. Does he get it? Does he know?\nMrs. Trump: He knows. He knows--\nStahl: He knows?\nMrs. Trump: --what's going on. And, he's very proud of his dad.\nStahl: Now-- you met with Michelle Obama yesterday. Was there any awkwardness, given--\nMrs. Trump: No.\nStahl: --what everybody was saying about everybody in the campaign?\nMrs. Trump: No. I didn't feel it.\nStahl: Not at all?\nMrs. Trump: No.\nStahl: Tell us about the meeting.\nMrs. Trump: Yes, she was a gracious host. We had a great time and we talk about raising children in the White House. She was very warm and very nice.\nStahl: You know, she raised the two kids in the White House. But she had her mother living there. That's an enormous help. Your parents are here, right?\nMrs. Trump: They're here.\nStahl: Will they go to Washington with you?\nMrs. Trump: They might. We will see. We will discuss that.\nStahl: Are you prepared, both of you, for the lack of privacy and the intense scrutiny? And you know, first ladies are really criticized if one little hair's out of place. Are you both prepared for this?\nMrs. Trump: We are used to it.\nPresident-elect Trump: I will say, it is on a different scale now, 'cause I've had a lot. But I've never had anything like this.\nStahl: You won't be able to walk down the street--\nMrs. Trump: I didn't do that for two years already, so you know, it will just continue. It's another level, but it will continue.\nStahl: FBI director James Comey. Are you going to ask for his resignation?\nPresident-elect Trump: I think that I would rather not comment on that yet. I don't-- I haven't made up my mind. I respect him a lot. I respect the FBI a lot. I think --\nStahl: Even though they leak so much?\nPresident-elect Trump: Well, there's been a lotta leaking, there's no question about that. But I would certainly like to talk to him. And see him. This is a tough time for him. And I would like to talk to him before I'd answer a question like that.\nStahl: Sounds like you're not sure.\nPresident-elect Trump: Well, sure, I'm not sure. I'd wanna see, you know, he may have had very good reasons for doing what he did.\nStahl: Are you gonna release your tax returns?\nPresident-elect Trump: At the appropriate time, I will release them. But right now I'm under routine audit. Nobody cares. The only one who cares is, you know, you and a few people that asked that question. Obviously, the public didn't care because I won the election very easily. So they don't care. I never thought they did care.\nStahl: Now, for months, you were running around saying that the system is rigged, the whole thing was rigged. You tweeted once that the Electoral College is a disaster for democracy.\nPresident-elect Trump: I do.\nStahl: So do you still think it's rigged?\nPresident-elect Trump: Well, I think the electoral ca-- look, I won with the Electoral College.\nStahl: Exactly.But do you think--\nPresident-elect Trump: You know, it's--\nStahl: --it's rigged?\nPresident-elect Trump: Yeah, some of the election locations are. Some of the system is. I hated--\nStahl: Even though you won you're saying that--\nPresident-elect Trump: I hated-- well, you know, I'm not going to change my mind just because I won. But I would rather see it where you went with simple votes. You know, you get 100 million votes and somebody else gets 90 million votes and you win. There's a reason for doing this because it brings all the states into play. Electoral College and there's something very good about that. But this is a different system. But I respect it. I do respect the system.\nStahl: What about vacations? You're not going to take any vacations? You've said that.\nPresident-elect Trump: We have so much work. There's so much work to be done. And I want to get it done for the people. I want to get it done. We're lowering taxes, we're taking care of health care. I mean, there's just so much to be done. So I don't think we'll be very big on vacations, no.\n5-Minute Fix newsletter\nKeeping up with politics is easy now.\nStahl: Are you gonna take the salary, the president's salary?\nPresident-elect Trump: Well, I've never commented on this, but the answer is no. I think I have to by law take $1, so I'll take $1 a year. But it's a -- I don't even know what it is.\nPresident-elect Trump: Do you know what the salary is?\nStahl: $400,000 you're giving up.\nPresident-elect Trump: No, I'm not gonna take the salary. I'm not taking it.", "timestamp": "2016-11-13", "title": "Interview with Lesley Stahl on CBS News \"60 Minutes\""}

Issa, R-CA, and eight cosponsors)\nThe Administration is committed to ensuring that regulations are smart and effective, that they are tailored to advance statutory goals in the most cost-effective and efficient manner, and that they minimize uncertainty. When a Federal agency promulgates a regulation, the agency must adhere to the robust and well-understood procedural requirements of Federal law, including the Administrative Procedure Act, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, the Paperwork Reduction Act, and the Congressional Review Act, in a manner that ensures that the rulemaking process is transparent and considers the input of stakeholders. In addition, for decades, agency rulemaking has been governed by Executive Orders issued and followed by administrations of both political parties. These require regulatory agencies to promulgate regulations, consistent with their statutes, upon a reasoned determination that the benefits justify the costs, to consider regulatory alternatives, and to promote regulatory flexibility.\nThe Administration continues to be guided by the same rigorous practices and principles used to develop and review regulations that have been upheld throughout the entirety of this Administration and previous Administrations. On December 17, 2015, the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs reiterated that the Administration would maintain its normal review standards, and instructed agencies to plan and prioritize its regulations in order to ensure an orderly review process during the final year of the Administration. For these reasons, H.R. 5982 is intended to solve a problem that does not exist.\nLastly, the Congressional Review Act (CRA) already allows for the Congress to disapprove of rules on a case-by-case basis. Thus, providing for an arbitrary packaging of rules for an up-or-down vote, as this bill does, is unnecessary. In addition, the bill would expand the scope of rules subject to the CRA such that by the time a vote on a resolution occurs, some of the rules may have been in effect for over a year. By doing so, H.R. 5982 would create tremendous regulatory uncertainty, potentially impose additional costs on businesses, and represent a step backwards for applying sound regulatory principles to protect public health, safety, the environment, and other critical aspects of society.\nIf the President were presented with H.R. 5982, his senior advisors would recommend he veto the bill.", "timestamp": "2016-11-14", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 5982 - Midnight Rules Relief Act of 2016"}

Huizenga, R-MI, and one cosponsor)\nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 5711, a bill that would prevent the United States from implementing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a diplomatic arrangement that peacefully and verifiably prevents Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. The bill would undermine the ability of the United States to meet our JCPOA commitments by effectively prohibiting the United States from licensing the sale of commercial passenger aircraft to Iran for exclusively civil end uses, as we committed to do in the JCPOA, and seeking to deter companies from pursuing permissible business with Iran. The JCPOA has significantly constrained Iran's nuclear program – key aspects of the program are dismantled under the JCPOA, and it subjects Iran's nuclear program to unprecedented verification and monitoring requirements. It is profoundly in the national security interest of the United States to continue to meet our commitments under the JCPOA as long as Iran continues to meet its commitments.\nThe bill prohibits the U.S. government from authorizing transactions by U.S. financial institutions in connection with the export or re-export of commercial passenger aircraft to the Government of Iran or Iranian entities and mandates the revocation of any such licenses already issued. Without the ability to license these transactions, the United States will be unable to fulfill one of its JCPOA commitments to the detriment of U.S. companies, foreign partners, and the world. The commitment to license these transactions, clearly outlined in the JCPOA text, has been clear since the conclusion of the JCPOA in July 2015 and as briefed publicly by this Administration, including during the robust congressional debate on the JCPOA. Attempts at this juncture to preclude implementation of U.S. commitments are in bad faith.\nThe bill further limits the role of Export-Import Bank financing by mandating vague restrictions with potentially undefined impact on commerce. For example, the bill requires the Export-Import Bank to cancel any financial assistance issued post-enactment that has \"facilitated\" the export, sale, or lease of an aircraft to Iran or an Iranian entity. The sweeping and vague nature of this provision would have a chilling effect on U.S. and non-U.S. entities seeking to engage in permissible business with Iran.\nThis bill, if enacted, would contravene U.S. commitments in the JCPOA and interfere with its successful implementation. The United States has a long tradition of remaining faithful to our commitments and our international partners, and a reversal of this principle undercuts our credibility, diminishes our ability to lead globally, and threatens the very alliances we rely upon in implementing the JCPOA. We fully expect that, if these measures became law, our closest allies would view this bill as a violation of our JCPOA commitments and Iran would take the issue to the Joint Commission. Our allies have steadfastly supported us when Iran has brought concerns to the Joint Commission, but they would be unable to do so if this legislation were enacted. We would lose the P5+1 unity on this issue that has been and will remain critical to preserving the deal. Continued implementation of JCPOA commitments by all participants – including the United States and our closest allies – is critical to ensuring that Iran's nuclear program is and will remain exclusively peaceful, which is profoundly in the national security interests of the United States and the international community.\nThe President has made it clear that he will veto any legislation that prevents the successful implementation of the JCPOA. If the President were presented with H.R. 5711, he would veto the bill.", "timestamp": "2016-11-14", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 5711 - To Prohibit the Secretary of the Treasury from Authorizing Certain Transactions by a U.S. Financial Institution in Connection with the Export or Re-Export of a Commercial Passenger Aircraft to the Islamic Republic of Iran"}
{"author": "Michelle Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=120951", "text": "DR. BIDEN: So good afternoon. It's so wonderful to be here with all of you today. And let me start by thanking Sheila Casey, a true friend and champion for all military families, including mine. Thank you, Sheila, for your kind words and support over the years. It's been a pleasure working with you and your husband, General Casey.\nWell, it's hard to believe that after five years, this is our last Joining Forces event. I remember the moment eight years ago, backstage in Springfield, Illinois, when Michelle and I decided we wanted to focus on this important issue together. It was that exciting day when then-Senator Obama announced that my husband Joe would be his running mate. Michelle turned to me and asked what would I like to work on if we won. And I told her that I wanted to tackle the issues that our military families were facing, and she said, \"Me too!\" (Laughter.) For me, I couldn't think of anything more fulfilling than serving those who have sacrificed so much for our country.\nOne thing we say in the Biden family -- and I know you all feel it in your hearts -- is that our country has one sacred obligation -- to equip those we send to war, and to care for them and their families during deployments and when they return. (Applause.)\nBack in 2008, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were going strong. Hundreds of thousands of our troops were deployed. So I called the National Guard and said I wanted to help the families of military families whose loved ones were serving overseas. They connected me with Delaware Boots on the Ground, which was helping to match the everyday needs of our military -- they're here, that's why it's making me so emotional -- to match the everyday needs of military families with folks who could provide the service. If you need a tire changed, Boots was there for you. If you had a leaky roof, Boots was there. If you needed diapers or a new crib, Boots was there again.\nDelaware Boots on the Ground made such a big difference for military families in Delaware that Governor Ruth Ann Minner declared on July 4th, 2007, Delaware Boots on the Ground Day. Remember guys? And after we were elected to the White House, I wanted to keep going. I wanted to keep doing all the things that I could for military families -- not just in Delaware, but all across our nation. Because, like Michelle, I had been so inspired by the military families, the incredible military families I had met and gotten to know over the years.\nThat's why, when we called upon you to help us shine a light on our military families, we wanted to raise awareness of the challenges that they confront and still confront that most Americans never have to face or can even imagine. Sending loved ones into harm's way. Enduring countless separations during training. Starting over on different bases in different towns again and again.\nAll of you in this room, from the veterans and military spouses we met eight years ago on the campaign trail to the nonprofits, schools, foundations, businesses, associations, civil servants and Americans of every stripe, have been with us every step of the way since we launched Joining Forces. You have been our lifeline to our military families. You've helped us better understand the unique challenges that they face. You've been critical in helping us find solutions to better support those amazing families. You've helped us remind folks that we can all make a difference, not just in word on Veterans Day or Memorial Day, but with good deeds and best efforts each and every day of the year, by doing what we do best.\nAs a lifelong educator and as a military mom, the way we reach out to our military children in our classrooms is especially close to my heart. That's why I've been so proud to work with organizations like the Military Child Education Coalition. Together, we launched Operation Educate the Educators to encourage teaching colleges to recognize military children in their curriculum. To date, more than 100 colleges and universities have signed up to train thousands of future teachers so that they are prepared to identify the challenges military kids face. (Applause.)\nAnd one of the first groups that Michelle and I partnered with to launch Joining Forces five years ago was the National Math and Science initiative. Thanks to NMSI's college readiness program, we're helping to ensure that students at 200 military-connected schools in 33 states across the country are prepared for the rigors of college and a career.\nI'd also like to thank the media, who has helped us share the story of the military family. And that includes everyone from Elmo and \"Sesame Street,\" to \"Reading Rainbow\" with LeVar Burton, who have shined a light on military-connected children, as well as the History Channel, which has lifted up our veterans, servicemembers, and their families. And I'd especially like to thank CEO of History Channel, Nancy Dubuc, for being here today.\nAll of you have stepped up for our military and their families in your own unique ways. That's what you do. And that's why you're here today. Because Michelle and I want you to know just how much we appreciate everything that you've done and everything that you will continue to do to support those who serve our country.\nAnd we all need to keep doing this work, because our military families will continue to serve and sacrifice. Our men and women in uniform will continue to deploy. Their spouses and children will continue to move from base to base, and eventually they will transition to civilian life. That's why this work matters. And we have to show them that we have their backs.\nYou know, I believe we couldn't have asked for a better champion for our military families than Michelle Obama. (Applause.) I know you all feel this. She is a woman like no other. (Applause.) Whip smart. Passionate. Loyal. For our nation, she's been a true role model, especially for young girls. She's raised two amazing girls on her -- of her own whose potential has no bounds. And she's shown the same warmth and care for her girls that she has with our grandchildren.\nAnd from day one, Michelle was determined to make a real and lasting difference in the lives of our military and their families -- measurable action, not just words. She has had the courage to take on veteran homelessness, making the seemingly impossible possible. (Applause.) Naturally, freely, warmly she brings joy and hope often simply through a hug to the deployed caregivers and wounded warriors.\nAs a military mom, I am grateful for her service. I love her. We're family. Our First Lady, Michelle Obama. (Applause.)\nMRS. OBAMA: Oh, my goodness. (Laughter.) This wasn't supposed to be tearful. (Laughter.) Oh, wow, look at you all. What an evening, what a day.\nFirst of all, let me thank --\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: I love you!\nMRS. OBAMA: We love you all. We love you all more than you can know. (Applause.) This community has kept us going through a lot. So let me just start by, of course, recognizing my partner in crime, Jill Biden, for that introduction. Oh, my goodness. (Applause.) Jill has been, by far, the best partner I could have ever imagined, not just for the work on Joining Forces, but our families have joined forces in so many ways. I'm just grateful to have her by my side. She's been a devoted advocate for our military community long before she ever came to the White House. This is her cause, as you can hear from her words. This is her mission. And her passion has really been at the heart and soul of Joining Forces from the beginning.\nBut Jill is much more than a partner. She is one of my dearest friends. And, as Jill said, we're family. This is my girl right here. (Applause.) We have laughed together. We have been silly together. We have cried a lot. (Laughter.) We've been there for each other as much as we can throughout this amazing journey. And Jill is not just brilliant, but she is kind. She is very funny. And she is one of the strongest people I know. I love and admire her with all my heart. So thank you, Jill. (Applause.)\nAnd of course, thanks to all of you -- my goodness -- folks from every sector of our society who've come together through Joining Forces -- CEOs and government officials, medical professionals and educators. And most of all, our extraordinary servicemembers, our amazing veterans, oh, and our military families. (Applause.)\nJust looking out over this room, so many of you have been with us right from the very beginning, way back in those early days when Jill and I were just starting to figure out what Joining Forces would look like. And back then, we'd get together with military spouses, and Blue and Gold Star families. We'd talk to veterans, and of course we talked to troops. And we'd ask the simple questions: How are things going? Do you have the support that you need? What can we do to help?\nAnd, as Jill said, we continue to be blown away by your honesty and your courage, your sacrifice, your service, moving your families across the country, across the globe every few years, enduring deployment after deployment, struggling to maintain your careers and care for your family -- I could go on and on. You keep us from complaining about anything. And I know that some of you were probably a little skeptical of us at first. Some may have wondered, how are these two with almost no budget going to make a difference? (Laughter.) And rightfully so, wondering would this just be another PR campaign? Because you had seen plenty of tributes and parades and memorials, all of which are very important, but nowhere near enough.\nAs I said earlier today, talk simply is not enough. So Jill and I knew it was time to act, and that's why we decided that the only measure of our success would be whether you all could see and feel a concrete difference in your lives. That was the only thing we cared about.\nSo in 2011, we issued a call to all Americans to step up and serve our military community as well as you all have served this country -– not just with kind words, but with real resources, with real support. And as we told you, people answered that call time and again. And that's what you should know about this country. Just when you wonder whether we're crazy -- (laughter) -- we're not. We're good people, all over the place. Know that about this country. (Applause.) We are made up of good people.\nFolks from every industry, every corner of this country, they raised their hand every time and they said, yeah, I can help. And just think for a minute about everything we've achieved together. I mean, you heard it in that beautiful video. In just five and a half years -- let's just stop there -- five and a half years, our businesses and companies have hired or trained more than 1.5 million veterans and military spouses, and the unemployment rate for our veterans has been cut in half. (Applause.) That's because of you. (Applause.)\nGovernors and legislatures in 50 states, all 50 states, took action to help military spouses transfer their licenses and continue their careers as they move from state to state -- simple ask. I think there were only two when we first started. And we were like, hey, can we get this done? Folks were like, yeah!\nWe provided new training and tools for thousands of healthcare providers. New networks and support for our caregivers. New resources and educational opportunities for our amazing military kids who, by the way, really blow us away. Those kids are some of the most amazing, poised -- (applause) -- those are our next leaders. So another thing to know about this country, we're in good hands, because our young people -- we've got some good young people. We do. (Applause.)\nAnd working with mayors and local officials, as we celebrated earlier today, we have ended veteran homelessness in cities and states across this country, housing 354,000 homeless veterans and their families. (Applause.) We did that. We did that. Through wonderful VA programs, we've worked to cut veterans' homelessness nearly in half. And we did that in just a couple of years.\nThat's just some of what Joining Forces has been able to accomplish, and it's because of you. Jill and I, we just ask, and then we wait for the press conference. We come in and we go, look what we did! (Laughter.) But we are so incredibly proud of you. You want the country to see this. This is America. And Jill and I, we are so grateful for everything you all have done.\nBut what we do not feel is satisfied, because --\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: That's right!\nMRS. OBAMA: That's my hype man back there. (Laughter.) Because for everything we've accomplished, we also know that every day, people across America thankfully are signing up to put on our country's uniform, and so many others hang it up for good and join the ranks of our veterans.\nSo our work is nowhere near finished. And it never will be. So my main message to all of you today is let's just keep this going. Let's keep it going. (Applause.) Plain and simple. (Applause.) We don't get all of this done in such a short period of time and just not keep pushing.\nAnd to our servicemembers, our veterans, and to our military families, I urge you to never settle for anything less. This effort, it hasn't been perfect. We haven't achieved every goal. We haven't righted every wrong. But believe me, from now on, this should be the baseline. This should be the minimum level of support our military should feel from their White House all the way down to every community in this country. (Applause.) They should feel it from the President and the Vice President, from the First and Second spouses on down to the VA, to VSOs, to schools, to hospitals, to congregations, to citizens. That's true regardless of who is in charge or what party they belong to.\nBecause this issue has nothing to do with whether you are a Democrat, a Republican or an independent. It is so much bigger than that. It's about supporting our American heroes. (Applause.) And it's about standing up for who we are as a nation. And that's something we can all agree on. There should never ever be any daylight between any of us when it comes to that.\nSo you all need to work with the next administration to continue these efforts. Whatever it is that you're working on, I want you to find new partners in the next administration. I want you to work with them just like you worked with us on the issues that matter most to our military community. And I want you all to know that while today might be our last time together here as First Lady -- and I hate to say Second Lady, because there's nothing second about Jill -- (laughter and applause) -- but we are not saying goodbye. This is not the end.\nJill and I intend to keep working on this issue for the rest of our lives. (Applause.) We will figure out a way to use whatever platforms we have next. And with your help, we know that the spirit of this movement will live on. We will continue to find ways to be supportive long after we leave the White House.\nThis movement will live on. It will live on in every military spouse who steps up and says, I'm tough, but even I can't do this alone, and every Governor who responds, you don't have to. It will live on in every veteran looking to bring their skills and their training to our workforce, and every CEO who gives them that chance. It will live on in every servicemember who knows their spouse is being supported during their deployment, and every teacher who goes that extra mile to make sure their kids feel welcome in a new school.\nThis effort is going to live on because it belongs to each of us and to every American who joins forces to support America's heroes. So instead of saying goodbye, I want to end as I started -- by once again saying thank you. (Applause.) This has been one of the greatest pleasures of my life, getting to know this community. We are grateful. We are grateful. And we have so much to feel grateful for in this country. Let us never forget that.\nLet's get to work. Thank you all. God bless.

{"author": "Michelle Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=120952", "text": "MRS. OBAMA: Thank you all so much. (Applause.) You all, please, please. Thanks so much. Welcome.\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Run for President! (Laughter.)\nMRS. OBAMA: Be quiet back there. (Laughter.)\nWell, this is a wonderful day for us all, and I'm so happy that we're here together.\nLet me start by thanking Mr. Banks for that wonderful introduction. I got to meet Mr. Banks earlier today because he invited me over to his house, so I thought I'd return the favor and invite Mr. Banks over to my house. But, as I told him, he is a role model. And he said, no, not me. And I said, yes, yes, because there are a lot of veterans out there just like Mr. Banks who aren't aware of the many resources that are there for them. And I think, as I told Mr. Banks, his story is going to help a lot of people get the support that they need and deserve.\nSo I am grateful to you, Mr. Banks, for having the courage to tell your story and to do it in the White House. So thank you so much. It was an honor spending time with you. (Applause.)\nSo as we gather here at the White House, I just want to take a moment to echo what my husband said last week about the results of our election. He said that we are all on one team -- not Democrats first or Republicans first, but we are Americans first. We're patriots first. (Applause.)\nAnd as I look around this room, I deeply feel the truth in those words. Because I see people here who I imagine belong to all different parties, maybe no party at all. And when it comes to supporting our American heroes, none of that matters, because this is something that we can all agree on. Am I right? (Applause.)\nOur love, our gratitude, our admiration for our men and women in uniform, our veterans and their families -- all of that is bigger than any one party or any one election. And we need to continue coming together to do this vitally important work at every level of government -- from our cities and towns all the way up to right here in the White House. And that's what you all have been doing for so many years now. That's why we wanted to have you here today.\nAnd as I look around, I see a lot of familiar faces, including folks who have been our partners since the day we first launched Joining Forces. And I have to tell you that back then, when we were first getting started and we were traveling around talking with folks in military communities and learning about existing efforts to support them, I was struck by how, so often, when it comes to honoring our military, we focus on symbolic things -- parades and medals and ceremonies. We give speeches and pin ribbons onto uniforms, etch names into walls. And all that is fine, but too often, all those tributes, all those words aren't always backed up by action.\nAnd that felt like such a stark contrast to me, because, as we all know, our military is all about action. When trouble breaks out, our men and women in uniform, they don't just sit around thinking about it or talking about it -- they act. They put on that uniform. They leave their loved ones behind. They go out there. They give orders. They follow orders. They do whatever it takes to keep our country safe. And they carry that ethic with them when they return to civilian life, becoming leaders in our communities, universities, our workplaces.\nAnd that's what they need from us -- they need action. Our veterans who fall on hard times and find themselves without a home deserve more than just handwringing or kind words. They deserve real help that gets them back on their feet. (Applause.)\nAnd that's really been our entire approach to Joining Forces. We believe that if we truly want to serve our veterans and military families, then we need to take action that they can see and feel in their daily lives. And that's particularly true when it comes to veterans' homelessness, especially since we actually know what we need to do to address this issue.\nThis is an identifiable population of people. We know who they are. We know what they need. And while it's not easy, it is absolutely possible to solve this problem once and for all if we all come together and we take action. (Applause.) That's the whole idea behind the Mayors Challenge: To set the highest possible goal -– the goal of ending veterans' homelessness shouldn't exist -– and to call on folks across this country to meet that goal.\nAnd all of you here have stepped up to answer that call in ways that we never could have dreamed of. You built teams in your cities to create lists of every homeless veteran. You tracked them down and you got them into housing. You worked with CEOs, with landlords, mental health providers -- anyone who has a role to play in helping our veterans. You coordinated health care, housing vouchers, job training. I could go on.\nAnd the results have been nothing short of breathtaking. Thirty-five communities, including four of the largest cities in America, and three states –- Virginia, Connecticut and Delaware –- have all ended veterans' homelessness. (Applause.) And America's largest city, New York City, has reduced veterans' homelessness by 85 percent. So they're almost there. (Applause.) And of the 35 communities that have achieved the goal, three of them achieved it just in the last week.\nSo we just keep moving forward, day after day, step by step. Altogether, we have cut veterans' homelessness nearly in half since 2010. (Applause.) And we reduced it by 17 percent last year alone. And through VA programs, we've helped house 354,000 veterans and their families.\nAgain, these are breathtaking accomplishments, especially when you consider the real human stories behind each of those numbers. Stories like Mr. Banks. Stories like another Vietnam-era veteran named Larry Mainor.\nLarry left the Army. When he left, he struggled with addiction, and for 30 years he was on the streets. Like too many veterans we hear about, he was spending nights under bridges or in cars, even sleeping out in the woods. But then Larry entered a homeless assistance program through VA, and with the help of the HUD-VASH supportive housing program, Larry was able to move into his own apartment. See, and the beauty is, when you get a house, place to live, then you can get a lot done.\nSo Larry got sober. He enrolled in culinary school. He met a wonderful woman. He fell in love -- that's why I gave you those two mugs. (Laughter.) And last year, on Veterans Day, Larry and his partner, they got married. And today, when Larry wakes up in the morning, instead of thinking about alcohol or drugs, he's thinking about all the good things in his life. And he said -- and these are his words -- he said, \"Larry is somebody now.\" (Applause.)\nThat's what a house can do. It's what giving our heroes a home can do. It can make them feel like somebody. Just think about the folks who don't have a home, how they must feel.\nSo we are making real progress. We are absolutely on our way to solving this problem. And we cannot let up for a single minute. Can't do it. Because we all know how this issue works. We all know that as long as our fellow Americans are serving in harm's way, we will always have new veterans transitioning to civilian life who might need our support. And a veteran who's doing just fine today could hit on hard times tomorrow.\nSo our work is never finished. It's not finished. The day that we find homes for every veteran, it's still not finished. We can never just pat ourselves on the back and move on to the next thing, not on this issue. On this issue, it takes continuous and unwavering attention and action no matter what else is going on in this country.\nAnd I especially want to focus on this point right now during this time of transition. As my husband and other elected officials across America leave office and new administrations come into power -- because I know that cities and states in this very room today have been able to solve this problem even with changes in leadership. So it is definitely possible to continue this work from one administration to the next. And I fully expect that to happen with the transition to our next President -- (applause) -- as well as with all the mayors and governors and other elected officials out there who are going to be transitioning in the coming year.\nOur servicemembers, veterans and military families deserve nothing less. They should never be content, ever again, with soothing platitudes or empty words. And what we've all achieved so far should be just the beginning. This is just one step. We should expect that any presidential administration that comes after us, God, I hope they far surpass what we've accomplished. I want to look back in eight years, in twelve years, twenty years, and say, man, what we did back in the Obama administration, we only scratched the surface. (Laughter.) It's like, call it what you want -- Joining Forces, name it after whatever you want -- we have no pride in credit. We just want the bar to be high. That's what folks should expect from their Commander-in-Chief and from all their elected officials. (Applause.)\nBut you all have to be those voices out there. So while this might be my last time coming before you as First Lady, today isn't any kind of an ending for me. (Laughter.) We're just getting started. And today -- yeah. (Applause.)\nSo today, I want you all to know how proud I am of everything you've achieved -- truly, it has been amazing to watch you all step up -- and how grateful I am for your outstanding work on this issue. I'm so excited to see everything you all will continue to accomplish in the years ahead. And know that Barack and I will continue to do our part wherever we are to lift up our military community. You don't get exposure to this community and ever, ever forget. So we're there for you, whatever the future holds for us.\nThank you all. God Bless.

Hello, everybody. In a couple hours, I'll be departing on my final foreign trip as President. And while we're abroad, I'll have a chance to take a few of your questions, but I figured why wait? I know that there's a lot of domestic issues that people are thinking about, so I wanted to see if I could clear out some of the underbrush so that when we're overseas and people are asking about foreign policy questions, people don't feel obliged to tack on three other questions to them.\nQ. We still will.\nThe President. Let me—I know you still will, yes. [Laughter] That I'm aware of, but I'm trying something out here. First of all, let me mention three brief topics.\nFirst of all, as I discussed with the President-elect on Thursday, my team stands ready to accelerate in the next steps that are required to ensure a smooth transition. And we are going to be staying in touch as we travel. I remember what it was like when I came in 8 years ago. It is a big challenge. This office is bigger than any one person. And that's why ensuring a smooth transition is so important.\nIt's not something that the Constitution explicitly requires, but it is one of those norms that are vital to a functioning democracy, similar to norms of civility and tolerance and a commitment to reason and to facts and analysis. It's part of what makes this country work. And as long as I'm President, we are going to uphold those norms and cherish and uphold those ideals.\nAs I've told my staff, we should be very proud that their work has already ensured that when we turn over the keys, the car is in pretty good shape. We are indisputably in a stronger position today than we were when I came in 8 years ago. Jobs have been growing for 73 straight months. Incomes are rising. Poverty is falling. The uninsured rate is at the lowest level on record. Carbon emissions have come down without impinging on our growth.\nAnd so my instructions to my team are that we run through the tape. We make sure that we finish what we started, that we don't let up in these last couple of months, because my goal is, on January 21, America is in the strongest position possible and, hopefully, there's an opportunity for the next President to build on that.\nNumber two, our work has also helped to stabilize the global economy. And because there is one President at a time, I'll spend this week reinforcing America's support for the approaches that we've taken to promote economic growth and global security on a range of issues.\nI look forward to my first visit in Greece. And then, in Germany, I'll visit with Chancellor Merkel, who's probably been my closest international partner these past 8 years. I'll also signal our solidarity with our closest allies and express our support for a strong, integrated, and united Europe. It's essential to our national security, and it's essential to global stability. And that's why the transatlantic alliance and the NATO alliance have endured for decades under Democratic and Republican administrations. Finally, in Peru, I'll meet with the leaders of countries that have been the focus of our foreign policy through our rebalance in the Asia-Pacific. This is a time of great change in the world. But America has always been a pillar of strength and a beacon of hope to peoples around the globe. And that's what it must continue to be.\nFinally, on a personal note, Michelle and I want to offer our deepest condolences to Gwen Ifill's family and to all of you, her colleagues, on her passing. Gwen was a friend of ours. She was an extraordinary journalist. She always kept faith with the fundamental responsibilities of her profession: asking tough questions, holding people in power accountable, and defending a strong and free press that makes our democracy work.\nI always appreciated Gwen's reporting, even when I was at the receiving end of one of her tough and thorough interviews. Whether she reported from a convention floor or from the field, whether she sat at the debate moderator's table or at the anchor's desk, she not only informed today's citizens, but she also inspired tomorrow's journalists. She was an especially powerful role model for young women and girls who admired her integrity, her tenacity, and her intellect, and for whom she blazed a trail as one-half of the first all-female anchor team on network news.\nSo Gwen did her country a great service. Michelle and I join her family and her colleagues, and everybody else who loved her in remembering her fondly today.\nSo with that, I'm going to take some questions. And because Josh Earnest has some pull around here, he just happened to put at the top of the list Colleen Nelson of the Wall Street Journal.\nMy understanding is, Colleen [Colleen McCain Nelson, Wall Street Journal], that this is wrapping up your stint here and you're going to Kansas City.\nQ. Yes.\nThe President. Josh just happens to be from Kansas City. [Laughter] So I didn't know if there was any coincidence there. But we wish you the very best of luck in your new endeavors.\nQ. As it turns out, there's no place like Kansas.\nThe President. There you go.\nU.S. Foreign Policy/President-Elect Donald J. Trump/North Atlantic Treaty Organization/2016 Presidential Election/Democratic Party\nQ. You're about to embark on your final foreign trip. What will you say to other world leaders about your successor? They've expressed many of the same misgivings that you have about Donald Trump. Should they be worried about the future of U.S. foreign policy? And separately, as Democrats scramble to regroup after a pretty shocking upset, what is your advice about where the party goes now? And who should lead your party?\nThe President. Good. One of the great things about the United States is that when it comes to world affairs, the President obviously is the leader of the executive branch, the Commander in Chief, the spokesperson for the Nation, but the influence and the work that we have is the result not just of the President. It is the result of countless interactions and arrangements and relationships between our military and other militaries and our diplomats and other diplomats and intelligence officers and development workers. And there is enormous continuity beneath the day-to-day news that makes us that indispensable nation when it comes to maintaining order and promoting prosperity around the world. That will continue. In my conversation with the President-elect, he expressed a great interest in maintaining our core strategic relationships. And so one of the messages I will be able to deliver is his commitment to NATO and the transatlantic alliance. I think that's one of the most important functions I can serve at this stage, during this trip, is to let them know that there is no weakening of resolve when it comes to America's commitment to maintaining a strong and robust NATO relationship and a recognition that those alliances aren't just good for Europe, they're good for the United States, and they're vital for the world.\nWith respect to the Democratic Party, look, as I said in the Rose Garden right after the election, when your team loses, everybody gets deflated, and it's hard, and it's challenging. And so I think it's a healthy thing for the Democratic Party to go through some reflection. I think it's important for me not to be big-footing that conversation. I think we want to see new voices and new ideas emerge. That's part of the reason why I think term limits are a really useful thing.\nI think the Democrats should not waver on our core beliefs and principles: the belief that we should have an economy that works for everybody, not just a few; the belief that America, at its best, is inclusive and not exclusive, that we insist on the dignity and God-given potential and worth of every child, regardless of race or gender or sexual orientation or what ZIP Code they were born in. That we are committed to a world in which we keep America safe, but we recognize that our power doesn't just flow from our extraordinary military, it also flows from the strength of our ideals and our principles and our values.\nSo there are going to be a core set of values that shouldn't be up for debate, should be our north star. But how we organize politically I think is something that we should spend some time thinking about. I believe that we have better ideas. But I also believe that good ideas don't matter if people don't hear them. And one of the issues that Democrats have to be clear on is that, given population distribution across the country, we have to compete everywhere. We have to show up everywhere. We have to work at a grassroots level, something that's been a running thread in my career.\nI won Iowa not because the demographics dictated that I would win Iowa, it was because I spent 87 days going to every small town and fair and fish fry and VFW hall. And there were some counties where I might have lost, but maybe I lost by 20 points instead of 50 points. There are some counties maybe I won that people didn't expect because people had a chance to see you and listen to you and get a sense of who you stood for and who you were fighting for.\nAnd the challenge for a national party is, how do you dig in there and create those kinds of structures so that people have a sense of what it is that you stand for? And that increasingly is difficult to do just through a national press strategy. It's increasingly difficult to do because of the splintering of the press.\nAnd so I think the discussions that have been taking place about how do you build more grassroots organizing, how do you build up State parties and local parties and schoolboard elections you're paying attention to and State rep races and city council races—that all, I think, will contribute to stronger outcomes in the future.\nAnd I'm optimistic that will happen. And I—for Democrats who are feeling completely discouraged, I've been trying to remind them everybody remembers my Boston speech in 2004; they may not remember me showing up here in 2005 when John Kerry had lost a close election, Tom Daschle, the leader of the Senate, had been beaten in an upset. Ken Salazar and I were the only two Democrats that won nationally. Republicans controlled the Senate and the House. And 2 years later, Democrats were winning back Congress, and 4 years later, I was President of the United States.\nThings change pretty rapidly. But it doesn't—they don't change inevitably. They change because you work for it. Nobody said democracy is supposed to be easy. This is hard. And in a big country like this, it probably should be hard.\nMark Knoller [ABC News].\nQ. Thank you, sir.\nThe President. Good to see you.\nU.S. Presidency/President-Elect Donald J. Trump/2016 Presidential Election\nQ. Thank you. Good to see you. Mr. President, what can you tell us about the learning curve on becoming President? Is—can you tell us how long it took you before you were fully at ease in the job, if that ever happens? And did you discuss this matter with President-elect Trump?\nThe President. About a week ago, I started feeling pretty good. [Laughter] No, look, I think the learning curve always continues. This is a remarkable job. It is like no other job on Earth. And it is a constant flow of information and challenges and issues. That is truer now than it has ever been, partly because of the nature of information and the interconnection between regions of the world.\nIf you were President 50 years ago, the tragedy in Syria might not even penetrate what the American people were thinking about on a day-to-day basis. Today, they're seeing vivid images of a child in the aftermath of a bombing. There was a time when if you had a financial crisis in Southeast Asia somewhere, it had no impact on our markets; today, it does.\nSo the amount of information, the amount of incoming that any administration has to deal with today, and respond to much more rapidly than ever before, that makes it different. I was watching a documentary, that during the Bay of Pigs crisis, JFK had about 2 weeks before anybody reported on it. Imagine that. I think it's fair to say that if something like that happens under a current President, they've got to figure out in about an hour what their response is.\nSo these are the kinds of points that I shared with the President-elect. It was a free-flowing and, I think, useful conversation. I hope it was. I tried to be as honest as I could about the things I think any President coming in needs to think about. And probably the most important point that I made was that how you staff—particularly your Chief of Staff, your National Security Adviser, your White House Counsel—how you set up a process and a system to surface information, generate options for a President, understanding that, ultimately, the President is going to be the final decisionmaker, that that's something that has to be attended to right away.\nI have been blessed by having—and I admittedly am biased—some of the smartest, hardest working, good people in my administration that I think any President has ever had. And as a consequence of that team, I've been able to make good decisions. And if you don't have that around you, then you'll get swamped. So I hope that he appreciated that advice.\nWhat I also discussed was the fact that I had been encouraged by his statements on election night about the need for unity and his interest in being the President for all people, and that how he staffs, the first steps he takes, the first impressions he makes, the reset that can happen after an election—all those things are important and should be thought about. And I think it's important to give him the room and the space to do that. It takes time to put that together.\nBut I emphasized to him that, look, in an election like this that was so hotly contested and so divided, gestures matter. And how he reaches out to groups that may not have supported him, how he signals his interest in their issues or concerns, I think those are the kinds of things that can set a tone that will help move things forward once he's actually taken office.\nQ. And how long did it take before you were at ease in the job?\nThe President. Well, I didn't really have time to worry about being at ease, because you'll recall, we were losing about 800,000 jobs a month.\nSo the good news is that in some ways, my experience is atypical. It's hard to find an analogous situation. By the time FDR came into office, the Depression had been going on for a couple of years. We were in the midst of a free fall. The financial system was locking up. The auto industry was about to go belly up. The housing market had entirely collapsed. So one of the advantages that I had was that I was too busy to worry about how acclimated I was feeling in the job. We just had to make a bunch of decisions.\nIn this situation, we're turning over a country that has challenges, has problems, and obviously, there are people out there who are feeling deeply disaffected. Otherwise, we wouldn't have had the results that we had in the election. On the other hand, if you look at the basic indicators of where the country is right now, the unemployment rate is as low as it's been in 8, 9 years. Incomes and wages have both gone up over the last year faster than they have in a decade or two. We've got historically low uninsured rates. The financial systems are stable. The stock market is hovering around its alltime high, and 401(k)s have been restored. The housing market has recovered.\nWe have challenges internationally, but our most immediate challenge with respect to ISIL, we're seeing significant progress in Iraq, and Mosul is now increasingly being retaken by Iraqi security forces supported by us. Our alliances are in strong shape. Our—the progress we've made with respect to carbon emissions has been greater than any country on Earth. And gas is 2 bucks a gallon.\nSo he will have time and space, I think, to make judicious decisions. The incoming administration doesn't have to put out a huge number of fires. They may want to take the country in a significantly different direction, but they've got time to consider what exactly they want to achieve. And that's a testament to the tremendous work that my team has done over the last 8 years. I'm very proud of them for it.\nAthena Jones [CNN].\nPresident-Elect Donald J. Trump/2016 Presidential Election\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. You said more than once that you did not believe that Donald Trump would ever be elected President, and that you thought he was unfit for the office. Now that you've spent time with him, sitting down and talking to him for an hour and a half in the Oval Office, do you now think that President-elect Trump is qualified to be President?\nAnd if I can do a compound question, the other one is, you mentioned staffing and tone. What do you say to those Americans who may not doubt that there will be a peaceful transition, but that are concerned about some of the policies and sentiments, either expressed by President-elect Trump himself or his supporters that may seem hostile to minorities and others? Specifically, I'm talking about the announcement that Steve Bannon, who is a proponent of the so-called alt-right movement, what many call the White nationalist movement, is going to have a prominent role in the White House under a President Trump as his chief strategist and senior adviser. What message does that send to the country, to the world?\nThe President. Okay. Athena, without copping out, I think it's fair to say that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on every appointment that the President-elect starts making if I want to be consistent with the notion that we're going to try to facilitate a smooth transition.\nLook, the people have spoken. Donald Trump will be the next President, the 45th President of the United States. And it will be up to him to set up a team that he thinks will serve him well and reflect his policies. And those who didn't vote for him have to recognize that that's how democracy works. That's how this system operates.\nWhen I won, there were a number of people who didn't like me and didn't like what I stood for. And I think that whenever you've got an incoming President of the other side, particularly in a bitter election like this, it takes a while for people to reconcile themselves with that new reality. Hopefully, it's a reminder that elections matter and voting counts. And so I don't know how many times we have to relearn this lesson, because we ended up having 43 percent of the country not voting who were eligible to vote. But it makes a difference.\nSo given that President-elect Trump is now trying to balance what he said in the campaign and the commitments he made to his supporters with working with those who disagreed with him and Members of Congress and reaching out to constituencies that didn't vote for him, I think it's important for us to let him make his decisions. And I think the American people will judge over the course of the next couple of years whether they like what they see and whether these are the kinds of policies and this is the direction that they want to see the country go in.\nAnd my role is to make sure that when I hand off this White House that it is in the best possible shape and that I've been as helpful as I can to him in going forward and building on the progress that we've made.\nAnd my advice, as I said, to the President-elect when we had our discussions was that campaigning is different from governing. I think he recognizes that. I think he's sincere in wanting to be a successful President and moving this country forward. And I don't think any President ever comes in saying to himself, I want to figure out how to make people angry or alienate half the country. I think he's going to try as best he can to make sure that he delivers, not only for the people who voted for him, but for the people at large. And the good thing is, is that there are going to be elections coming up, so there's a built-in incentive for him to try to do that.\nBut it's only been 6 days. And I think it will be important for him to have the room to staff up, to figure out what his priorities are, to be able to distinguish between what he was campaigning on and what is practical, what he can actually achieve. There are certain things that make for good sound bites, but don't always translate into good policy. And that's something that he and his team, I think, will wrestle with, in the same way that every President wrestles with.\nI did say to him, as I've said publicly, that because of the nature of the campaigns and the bitterness and ferocity of the campaigns, that it's really important to try to send some signals of unity and to reach out to minority groups or women or others that were concerned about the tenor of the campaign. And I think that's something that he will want to do. But this is all happening real fast. He's got commitments to supporters that helped to get him here, and he's going to have to balance those. And over the coming weeks and months and years, my hope is, is that those impulses ultimately win out. But it's a little too early to start making judgments on that.\nQ. And your views about qualifications, has that changed after meeting with him?\nThe President. I think that he successfully mobilized a big chunk of the country to vote for him, and he's going to win—he has won. He's going to be the next President. And regardless of what experience or assumptions he brought to the office, this office has a way of waking you up. And those aspects of his positions or predispositions that don't match up with reality he will find shaken up pretty quick, because reality has a way of asserting itself.\nAnd some of his gifts that obviously allowed him to execute one of the biggest political upsets in history, those are ones that, hopefully, he will put to good use on behalf of all the American people.\nScott Horsley [NPR].\nU.S. Economy/Trade/2016 Presidential Election\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. You're off to Europe, which is facing some of the same populist pressures we see at work in this country. When you spoke at the U.N., you talked about the choice we're facing between integration and building walls.\nThe President. Right.\nQ. What choice do you think the American people made last week? And is there still a chance for what you called a course correction before Europeans make some of their choices?\nThe President. I think the American people recognize that the world has shrunk, that it's interconnected, that you're not going to put that genie back in the bottle. The American people recognize that their careers or their kids' careers are going to have to be more dynamic, that they might not be working at a single plant for 30 years, but they might have to change careers. They might have to get more education. They might have to retool or retrain.\nAnd I think the American people are game for that. They want to make sure that the rules of the game are fair. And what that means is that if you look at surveys around Americans' attitudes on trade, the majority of the American people still support trade. But they're concerned about whether or not trade is fair and whether we've got the same access to other countries' markets as they have with us. Is there just a race to the bottom when it comes to wages and so forth?\nNow, I made an argument—thus far, unsuccessfully—that the trade deal we had organized, TPP, did exactly that: that it strengthened workers' rights and environmental rights, leveled the playing field, and as a consequence, would be good for American workers and American businesses. But that's a complex argument to make when people remember plants closing and jobs being offshored.\nSo part of what I think this election reflected was people wanting that course correction that you described. And the message around stopping surges of immigration, not creating new trade deals that may be unfair, I think those were themes that played a prominent role in the campaign. As we now shift to governing, my argument is that we do need to make sure that we have an orderly, lawful immigration process, but that if it is orderly and lawful, immigration is good for our economy. It keeps this country young. It keeps it dynamic. We have entrepreneurs and strivers who come here and are willing to take risks. And that's part of the reason why America, historically, has been successful. It's part of the reason why our economy is stronger and better positioned than most of our other competitors, is because we've got a younger population that's more dynamic.\nWhen it comes to trade, I think when you're governing, it will become increasingly apparent that if you were to just eliminate trade deals with Mexico, for example, well, you've got a global supply chain. The parts that are allowing auto plants that were about to shut down to now employ double shifts is because they're bringing in some of those parts to assemble out of Mexico. And so it's not as simple as it might have seemed.\nAnd the key for us—when I say \"us,\" I mean Americans, but I think particularly for progressives—is to say your concerns are real, your anxieties are real, here's how we fix them: higher minimum wage; stronger worker protections so workers have more leverage to get a bigger piece of the pie; stronger financial regulations, not weaker ones; yes to trade, but trade that ensures that these other countries that trade with us aren't engaging in child labor, for example; being attentive to inequality and not tone deaf to it, but offering prescriptions that are actually going to help folks in communities that feel forgotten.\nThat's going to be our most important strategy. And I think we can successfully do that. People will still be looking to the United States. Our example will still carry great weight. And it continues to be my strong belief that the way we are going to make sure that everybody feels a part of this global economy is not by shutting ourselves off from each other even if we could, but rather by working together more effectively than we have in the past.\nMartha Raddatz [ABC News].\nPresident-Elect Donald J. Trump/Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\nQ. Thanks, Mr. President. Given some of the harsh words you had about Mr. Trump, calling him \"temperamentally unfit to be Commander in Chief,\" did anything surprise you about President-elect Trump when you met with him in your office? And also I want to know, does anything concern you about a Trump Presidency?\nThe President. Well, we had a very cordial conversation. And that didn't surprise me to some degree, because I think that he is obviously a gregarious person. He's somebody who, I think, likes to mix it up and to have a vigorous debate.\nAnd what's clear is that he was able to tap into, yes, the anxieties, but also the enthusiasm of his voters in a way that was impressive. And I said so to him, because I think that to the extent that there were a lot of folks who missed the Trump phenomenon, I think that connection that he was able to make with his supporters that was impervious to events that might have sunk another candidate, that's powerful stuff.\nI also think that he is coming to this office with fewer set, hard-and-fast policy prescriptions than a lot of other Presidents might be arriving with. I don't think he is ideological. I think ultimately, he's pragmatic in that way. And that can serve him well, as long as he's got good people around him and he has a clear sense of direction.\nDo I have concerns? Absolutely. Of course, I've got concerns. He and I differ on a whole bunch of issues. But the Federal Government and our democracy is not a speedboat, it's an ocean liner, as I discovered when I came into office. It took a lot of really hard work for us to make significant policy changes, even in our first 2 years, when we had larger majorities than Mr. Trump will enjoy when he comes into office.\nAnd one of the things I advised him to do was to make sure that before he commits to certain courses of action, he's really dug in and thought through how various issues play themselves out. I'll use a obvious example where we have a difference, but it will be interesting to see what happens in the coming year, and that's the Affordable Care Act.\nSo, obviously, this has been the holy grail for Republicans over the last 6, 7 years—was, \"We've got to kill Obamacare.\" Now, that has been taken as an article of faith, that this is terrible, it doesn't work, and we have to undo it.\nBut now that Republicans are in charge, they've got to take a look and say, let's see, we've got 20 million people who have health insurance who didn't have it before; health care costs generally have gone up at a significantly slower rate since Obamacare was passed than they did before, which has saved the Federal Treasury hundreds of billions of dollars; people who have health insurance are benefiting in all sorts of ways that they may not be aware of, everything from no longer having lifetime limits on the claims that they can make, to seniors getting prescription drug discounts under Medicare, to free mammograms.\nNow, it's one thing to characterize these—this thing as not working when it's just an abstraction. Now, suddenly, you're in charge, and you're going to repeal it. Okay, well, what happens to those 20 million people who have health insurance? Are you going to just kick them off, and suddenly, they don't have health insurance? And in what ways are their lives better because of that? Are you going to repeal the provision that ensures that if you do have health insurance on your job and you lose your job or you change jobs or you start a small business, that you're not discriminated against because you've got a preexisting condition? That's really popular. How are you going to replace it? Are you going to change the policy that kids can stay on their parent's health insurance plan until they're 26? How are you going to approach all these issues?\nNow, my view is that if they can come up with something better that actually works, and a year or two after they've replaced the Affordable Care Act with their own plan, that 25 million people have health insurance, and it's cheaper and better and running smoothly, I'll be the first ones to say, that's great, congratulations.\nIf, on the other hand, whatever they're proposing results in millions of people losing coverage and results in people who already have health insurance losing protections that were contained in the legislation, then we're going to have a problem. And I think that's not going to be unique to me; I think the American people will respond that way.\nSo I think on a lot of issues, what you're going to see is, now comes the hard part. Now is governance. We are going to be able to present to the incoming administration a country that is stronger; a Federal Government that is working better and more efficiently; a national security apparatus that is both more effective and truer to our values; energy policies that are resulting in not just less pollution, but also more jobs.\nAnd I think the President-elect, rightly, would expect that he's judged on whether we improve from that baseline and on those metrics, or things get worse. And if things get worse, then the American people will figure that out pretty quick. And if things get better, then more power to him. And I'll be the first to congratulate him. U.S. Presidency/President-Elect Donald J. Trump\nQ. But you, sir—Mr. President, you had talked specifically about his temperament. Do you still have any concern about his temperament?\nThe President. As I said—because, Athena asked the question—whatever you bring to this office, this office has a habit of magnifying and pointing out, and hopefully, then you correct for it.\nThis may seem like a silly example, but I know myself well enough to know I can't keep track of paper. I am not well organized in that way. And so pretty quickly, after I'm getting stacks of briefing books coming in every night, I say to myself, I've got to figure out a system, because I have bad filing, sorting, and organizing habits. And I've got to find some people who can help me keep track of this stuff. Now, that seems trivial, but actually, it ends up being a pretty big piece of business.\nI think what will happen with the President-elect is, there are going to be certain elements of his temperament that will not serve him well unless he recognizes them and corrects them. Because when you're a candidate and you say something that is inaccurate or controversial, it has less impact than it does when you're President of the United States. Everybody around the world is paying attention. Markets move. National security issues require a level of precision in order to make sure that you don't make mistakes. And I think he's—he recognizes that this is different, and so do the American people.\nAll right, I'm going to take just a couple more questions, and then I get out of here.\nNadia Bilbassy [Nadia Bilbassy-Charters, Al Arabiya].\nIran/Paris Agreement on Climate Change/Environment\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. President-elect Trump threatened to unravel the Iran nuclear deal, which your administration worked very hard to achieve. What was your concern if he alters part of it? And what would your advice be, considering that he said he's open to your advice?\nAnd on Syria, sir, the Syrian regime now is threatening Aleppo with a massive onslaught. You talked passionately a few years back about Benghazi, and you warned against the killing of civilians there. Many people criticized your administration for the shortcoming on the Syria policy. Are you willing to let Aleppo fall under your watch? And how do you react to President Trump—I mean, President-elect Trump's statement that he won't support the Syrian opposition anymore? Thank you.\nThe President. Iran is a good example of the gap, I think, between some of the rhetoric in this town—not unique to the President-elect—and the reality. I think there was a really robust debate about the merits of the Iran deal before it was completed. And I actually was pretty proud of how our democracy processed that. It was a serious debate. I think people of good will were on both sides of the issue. Ultimately, we were able to persuade Members of Congress and the public—at least enough of them—to support it.\nAt the time, the main argument against it was, Iran wouldn't abide by the deal, that they would cheat. We now have over a year of evidence that they have abided by the agreement. That's not just my opinion; it's not just people in my administration. That's the opinion of Israeli military and intelligence officers who are part of a Government that vehemently opposed the deal. So my suspicion is, is that when the President-elect comes in, and he's consulting with his Republican colleagues on the Hill, that they will look at the facts. Because to unravel a deal that's working and preventing Iran from pursuing a nuclear weapon would be hard to explain, particularly if the alternative were to have them freed from any obligations and go ahead and pursue a weapon.\nAnd keep in mind, this is not just an international agreement between us and the Iranians; this is between the P-5-plus-1, other countries, some of our closest allies. And for us to pull out would then require us to start sanctioning those other countries in Europe or China or Russia that were still abiding by the deal because, from their perspective, Iran had done what it was supposed to do.\nSo it becomes more difficult, I think, to undo something that's working than undo something that isn't working. And when you're not responsible for it, I think you can call it a terrible deal. When you are responsible for the deal and preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, you're more likely to look at the facts.\nThat is going to be true in other circumstances. For example, the Paris Agreement. Obviously, there's been a lot of talk about the possibility of undoing this international agreement. Now, you've got 200 countries that have signed up for this thing. And the good news is that what we've been able to show over the last 5, 6, 8 years is that it's possible to grow the economy really fast and possible to bring down carbon emissions as well.\nIt's not just a bunch of rules that we've set up. You've got utilities that are putting in solar panels and creating jobs. You've got the Big Three automakers who have seen record sales and are overachieving on the fuel efficiency standards that we set. Turns out that people like not having to fill up as often and save money at the pump, even if it's good for the environment.\nYou've got States like California that have been moving forward on a clean energy agenda separate and apart from any Federal regulations that have been put forward. In fact, 40 percent of the country already lives under—in States that are actively pursuing what's embodied in the Paris Agreement and the Clean Power Plant rule. And even States like Texas that politically tend to oppose me, you've seen huge increases in wind power and solar power. And you've got some of the country's biggest companies, like Google and Walmart, all pursuing energy efficiency because it's good for their bottom line.\nSo what we've been able to do is to embed a lot of these practices into how our economy works. And it's made our economy more efficient, it's helped the bottom line of folks, and it's cleaned up the environment.\nWhat the Paris Agreement now does is say to China and India and other countries that are potentially polluting, come onboard; let's work together so you guys do the same thing.\nAnd the biggest threat when it comes to climate change and pollution isn't going to come from us, because we only have 300 million people. It's going to come from China, with over a billion people, and India, with over a billion people. And if they are pursuing the same kinds of strategies that we did before we became more aware of the environment, then our kids will be choked off.\nAnd so, again, do I think that this new administration will make some changes? Absolutely. But these international agreements, the tradition has been that you carry them forward across administrations, particularly if, once you actually examine them, it turns out that they're doing good for us and binding other countries into behavior that will help us. All right? Last question. Justin Sink [Bloomberg].\nLibya/Syria\nMs. Bilbassy-Charters. Sir, sir, on Syria.\nThe President. I'm sorry—oh, I'm sorry. Okay, you're right. You are right about that.\nWith respect to Syria, in Benghazi, we had an international mandate. We had a U.N. security resolution. We had a broad-based coalition, and we were able to carry out a support mission that achieved the initial goal of preventing Benghazi from being slaughtered fairly quickly. It's no secret—you know this region well—that Syria is a much more messy situation, with proxies coming from every direction.\nAnd so I wish that I could bring this to a halt immediately. We have made every effort to try to bring about a political resolution to this challenge. John Kerry has spent an infinite amount of time trying to negotiate with Russians and Iranians and Gulf States and other parties to try to end the killing there. But if what you're asking is, do we have the capacity to carry out the same kinds of military actions in Syria that we did in Libya, the situation is obviously different. We don't have that option easily available to us.\nAnd so we're going to have to continue to try to pursue, as best we can, a political solution and, in the interim, put as much pressure as we can to the parties to arrive at humanitarian safe spaces and cease-fires that at least alleviate the suffering that's on the ground.\nI recognize that that has not worked. And it is something that I continue to think about every day, and we continue to try to find some formula that would allow us to see that suffering end. But I think it's not surprising to you, because you study this deeply, that if you have a Syrian military that is committed to killing its people indiscriminately, as necessary, and it is supported by Russia that now has substantial military assets on the ground and are actively supporting that regime, and Iran actively supporting that regime, and we are supporting what has to be our number-one national security priority, which is going after ISIL both in Mosul and ultimately in Raqqa—that the situation is not the same as it was in Libya.\nAnd obviously, there are some who question the steps we took in Libya. I continue to believe that was the right thing to do, although, as I indicated before, in the aftermath of that campaign, I think the world community did not sufficiently support the need for some sort of security structures there, and it now is a situation that we have to get back into a better place.\nQ. [Inaudible]\nThe President. I've given you—okay. Last question is Justin Sink of Bloomberg.\nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Policy/Guantanamo Bay Detention Center/Government Ethics/Department of Veterans Affairs\nQ. Thanks, Mr. President. I wanted to ask about two things that might be on your desk over the next couple months as you prepare for a Trump administration. One is at least three-quarters of a million undocumented immigrants provided the Federal Government information about themselves and their families as part of your deferred action program. I'm wondering if there's anything you can do to either reassure them or shield that information from the incoming Trump administration, considering his stance on immigration.\nAnd the second is, the administration and you have long maintained that the legal restraints upon you by Congress governing the movement of detainees from Gitmo are an unconstitutional infringement on your right as Commander in Chief. Considering that the gradual transfers that you've pursued are unlikely to continue under a Trump administration, is this now the time to, sort of, test that theory by moving the detainees and seeing where the chips end up lying?\nThe President. Those are both excellent questions. On the deferred action program that we have, known as DACA, that relates to DREAMers who are currently benefiting from these provisions, I will urge the President-elect and the incoming administration to think long and hard before they are endangering the status of what for all practical purposes are American kids.\nI mean, these are kids who were brought here by their parents. They did nothing wrong. They've gone to school. They have pledged allegiance to the flag. Some of them have joined the military. They've enrolled in school. By definition, if they're part of this program, they are solid, wonderful young people of good character. And it is my strong belief that the majority of the American people would not want to see suddenly those kids have to start hiding again. And that's something that I will encourage the President-elect to look at.\nWith respect to Guantanamo, it is true that I have not been able to close the darn thing—[laughter]—because of the congressional restrictions that have been placed on us. What is also true is, we have greatly reduced the population. You now have significantly less than a hundred people there. There are some additional transfers that may be taking place over the next 2 months.\nThere is a group of very dangerous people that we have strong evidence of having been guilty of committing terrorist acts against the United States. But because of the nature of the evidence—in some cases, that evidence being compromised—it's very difficult to put them before a typical Article III court. And that group has always been the biggest challenge for us. My strong belief and preference is that we would be much better off closing Gitmo, moving them to a different facility that was clearly governed by U.S. jurisdiction. We'd do it a lot cheaper and just as safely.\nCongress disagrees with me, and I gather that the President-elect does as well. We will continue to explore options for doing that. But keep in mind that it's not just a matter of what I'm willing to do. One of the things you discover about being President is that there are all these rules and norms and laws and you've got to pay attention to them. And the people who work for you are also subject to those rules and norms. And that's a piece of advice that I gave to the incoming President.\nI am very proud of the fact that we will—knock on wood—leave this administration without significant scandal. We've made mistakes, there have been screw-ups, but I will put the ethics of this administration and our track record in terms of just abiding by the rules and norms and keeping trust with the American people—I will put this administration against any administration in history.\nAnd the reason is because, frankly, we listened to the lawyers. And we had a strong White House Counsel's Office. We had a strong Ethics Office. We had people in every agency whose job it was to remind people, this is how you're supposed to do things. It doesn't mean everybody always did everything exactly the way it's supposed to, because we've got 2 million people working in the Federal Government, if you're including the military, and so we had to just try to institutionalize this as much as we could. And that takes a lot of work. And one of my suggestions to the incoming President is, is that he take that part of the job seriously as well. Again, you wouldn't know this if you were listening to some news outlets or some members of oversight committees in Congress. [Laughter] But if you actually look at the facts, it works.\nAnd this is just one example of the numerous ways in which the Federal Government is much better today than it was, without people really knowing. You look at VA. People remember the legitimate problems that were publicized in Phoenix. It was scandalous what happened. What people don't remember is, is that we've brought in well over a million people who are getting benefits that weren't getting it before, driven the backlog for disability benefits way down, cut homelessness in half. Just made the agency work better—not work perfect, but work better.\nAnd one of the mottos I always had with my staff was, better is good. Perfect is unattainable. Better is possible.\nAnd so we will try to share the lessons that we've learned over these last 8 years with the incoming President. And my hope is, he makes things better. And if he does, we'll all benefit from it.\nAll right? Thank you, everybody. You guys, some of you who are traveling, you'll get a chance to ask more questions. All right?\n[At this point, several reporters began asking questions.]\nThank you.", "timestamp": "2016-11-14", "title": "The President's News Conference"}

Hey, Jon Carson!\nOrganizing for Action Advisory Board Chair and Former Executive Director Jon Carson. There you are, President Obama.\nThe President. Are you stalling for me? [Laughter]\nMr. Carson. That's what I was doing. We're here now, so it's all yours.\nThe President. Has Plouffe made any sense?\nOrganizing for America Adviser and Former White House Counselor David A. Plouffe. None at all, sir. That's why we've been waiting for you. [Laughter]\nThe President. All right. Well, listen, everybody, I apologize, my press conference went a little bit long. Shockingly, people have a—lots of questions for me.\nI wanted to get everybody on the phone, first and foremost, just to say thank you. I mean, I could not be prouder of everything that you helped us accomplish. There are people on this phone who joined up on this amazing journey when I was running for Senate. There are people who joined us on our first forays into Iowa, back in 2007. And all of you, in all your different ways, have contributed to what has been an amazing run over these last 8 years.\nFor those of you who didn't hear the press conference, basically, I just ticked off what we've accomplished in terms of saving the economy, cutting unemployment in half, lowest uninsured in history, incomes up, wages up, historic climate deal—all these things. And what I said was that the measure of what we worked so hard for is, during our period driving this bus, was the country going to end up in better place? And it indisputably has. When we turn over the keys—the country will know it because we will have the data and the metrics, the measuring sticks, to prove it—that by almost every measure, America is better off than it was.\nNow, that doesn't mean that we're not all disappointed by what happened last week. I think it's fair to say that your President feels your pain on this one. It doesn't feel good. And in some ways, it feels worse because, for a lot of us, I think we didn't see it coming. Surprising losses are harder than losses you see. And I know it's also difficult in part because, when you look at public opinion around the current performance of my administration, it's higher than it's been since probably the first 3 months of the administration. And so there's that little mismatch, and that also makes it more difficult.\nBut I've always said, progress doesn't follow a straight line. It zigs and zags, and sometimes, it moves forward, and sometimes, it moves backwards or moves sideways. I am a firm believer that ultimately it moves in the direction of justice and more prosperity and more freedom and more inclusion. And the reason it happens is because of the people on this phone call and people like you and your idealism and your energy and your resilience over the course of American history.\nSo, as a consequence, I think it is fine for everybody to feel stressed, sad, discouraged for a while, but I'm giving you, like, a week and a half to get over it. And if you need the rest of this week, that's fine. But by next week, and Thanksgiving—because you're going to be talking to your family and friends, and some of them may even have voted the wrong way, you're in danger of having, like, some big argument that spoils the whole family get-together—you're going to have to be in a more positive place. And what that means is staying engaged, staying involved, and figuring out how do we move forward not only to protect what we've accomplished, but also to see this as an opportunity, because a lot of conventional wisdom has been upended.\nI was asked about this during the press conference. People are going to be asking more questions about how we can organize at a grassroots level. People are going to be asking more questions about how do we communicate our issues more effectively. People are going to be looking at how do you make sure that the work that's done isn't just in Washington or in New York or L.A., but in towns and small communities all across the country.\nAnd the network that you represent, you're perfectly poised to do that. In other words, now is the time for some organizing. An election just finished, so it's not going to be straight political organizing, but it is going to be raising awareness; it's going to be the work you're doing in nonprofits and advocacy and community-building. And over time, what's going to happen is, is that you will reinvigorate and inform our politics in ways that we can't anticipate.\nSo don't mope. And don't get complacent. The majority of the American people believe in a diverse, tolerant, optimistic, dynamic, inclusive vision. And as somebody who knows a thing or two about organizing, I want you to remember never to underestimate yourselves, because you guys are the best organizers I know. So don't suddenly veer off into isolation. Keep on working. Stay connected.\nI know David and others are going to convene folks at other times. So stay close to each other. Generate ideas. Take some time to reflect and let's brainstorm in terms of how you're going to work together to move forward. Understand that I'm going to be constrained in what I do with all of you until I am again a private citizen. But that's not so far off. It's basically 6, 8 weeks away. And I will have some time for vacation, but you're going to see me early next year, and we're going to be in a position where we can start cooking up all kinds of great stuff to do.\nIn the meantime, make sure that you stay involved locally. Find organizations that are speaking to your passions. Continue to be engaged with OFA around issues that—or just information and networking and ideas-sharing that can be done. And if you do those things, I promise you that next year Michelle and I are going to be right there with you and the clouds are going to start parting and the sun is going to come back out and we're going to be busy, involved in the amazing stuff that we've been doing all these years before.\nAnd I've got all kinds of thoughts and ideas about it, but this isn't the best time to share them. The point is, I'm still fired up and I'm still ready to go. And I hope that all of you are, as well. And just in pure political terms, I've been reminding my staff that when I came into Washington in 2005 and was sworn in as a Senator, it was the same moment that George Bush was sworn back in as President of the United States for the second term, and Republican controlled the House and Republicans controlled the Senate. And Tom Daschle, who had been the Democratic majority leader, had lost his seat, and it looked very, very bleak. Two years later, Democrats were winning back the Congress, and 4 years later I was President.\nThat's pretty unlikely, but that's how stuff works when you've got amazing people all across the country who are willing to put their all into making this country better. What was true then is true now. So like I said, you've got another few days to feel bad, and then we've got to get busy. All right?\nThank you, guys.

And thanks, Donna, for your wonderful work. Thanks all of you for hopping on the phone.\nLook, first of all, I just want to say thank you. The incredible support you've shown me over the years has allowed me to do the good that we have done. And it is indisputable that the country is better off today than it was 8 years ago. I ticked off some of the reasons for that during the press conference that I had right before I got on the line here. And it's pretty hard to argue with. And in fact, the American people—based on their assessments of our performance right now—tend to agree.\nAnd I always tell my team that our job when we are entrusted with this amazing office at the pinnacle of our democracy is to make sure that the country is better off than it was when we started.

And that was all based on the work that you guys do all across this country at the State and local and grassroots levels. Delegates, members, donors—I couldn't have done it without you. And for that I will always be grateful.\nNow, I know that you put that same kind of effort into this cycle, and I want to publicly say how proud I am of Hillary Clinton on a history-making race. We did not get the results we wanted, but we took a step in shattering a barrier that's still there. And little girls and little boys are going to have a different sense of the possible thanks to her nomination and her candidacy.\nThat doesn't mean we don't hurt for what was an unexpected loss. And expected losses are hard enough; unexpected ones are just worse. And that's okay. I was telling my team, you're allowed to mope for a week and a half, maybe two if you really need it. But after that, we've got to brush ourselves off and get back to work. We've got to come together and focus on a way ahead.\nAnd it's important that we do that in a way that's consistent with who we are as Democrats. It means that we're listening to each other. We're reflecting. We're asking tough questions. We're respectful of different points of view. We're basing our decisions on facts and careful analysis, and we're taking the long view. And we're strategizing.\nAnd in the months ahead, my hope is, is that we're convening Democrats at every level from the DNC to local ward and town committees to assess where we've fallen short and how we can build for elections, not just in Presidential years, but every year. Because I've been on this for a while. And I said this in my press conference. We have better ideas, but they have to be heard for us to actually translate those ideas into votes and ultimately into action.\nAnd the challenge we have is that partly because of geographic distribution, there are big chunks of the country that just aren't hearing us. And they won't hear us if we're not showing up and if we're not there fighting day in, day out for those ideas.\nAnd that is not something that you can just do every 4 years. It's something that you've got to do over a lengthy period of time: building trust, building relationships, making sure that people understand what we're about, focusing on down ballot, recruiting, training candidates, reaching out to every community, whether they agree or disagree. Because even in communities that are rock-solid Republican, there's a difference between us losing 60-40 or losing 80-20. And that can swing an election.\nWe've got to train new voters. We've got to train volunteers. All that work has to be done. And look, one of the challenges that I've discovered being President is, I'd like to be organizer in chief, but it's hard. You've got Syria, and you've got NATO, and you have summit meetings and economic issues that you have to deal with on ongoing basis. You try to get legislation done. That's why the DNC is so important. That's why our local State parties are so important. And although we haven't been able to do as much as I would like in order to assure that we've got the results we did in this election, I'm absolutely confident that it can be done. We've just got to be a little more strategic, and we've got to work a little bit harder.\nAnd for the next 2 months, my main job is to make sure we finish up strong so that when I turn over the keys, I can continue to say unequivocally and demonstrably that the country is better off than when I found it. Part of that is also facilitating a decent transition so that the American people are as well served as they can be with the incoming administration.\nBut then, I'm going to be a private citizen, and I'm not going to stop, as citizen, working on behalf of the things that I care about, and I'm hoping that I'm going to have the opportunity to work with a whole bunch of you in all kinds of different ways. And now is not the time for me to spell out how that might happen, but I'm sure that we are going to be working shoulder to shoulder for many, many years to come.\nJust a couple of final thank-yous. Again, Hillary Clinton did unbelievable work. So did Bernie Sanders. My two partners here, Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi, I could not have better partners than them in everything that we've accomplished. I want you to know, because I've been reading a lot of these reports, this notion that somehow all the work we did suddenly gets stripped away—let me tell you something, we got more done than any administration in the last who-knows-how-many decades, and if they roll back 15 or 20 percent of that, we're still 80 percent ahead. And that's not going to be as easy as I think some people feel, particularly if we continue to make the case and mobilize.\nI just did my press conference, talked about the fact that suddenly everybody is going realize that 20 million people with health insurance that didn't have it before and protection against the discrimination for preexisting conditions and discounts for seniors and all this stuff—when you poll these things individually, people like them, and they don't want them taken away. And we're going to be in a position to make the case that the work we've done is good and a lot of it needs to be preserved. And if it can be improved upon, then we should be open minded to improving it.\nThe bottom line is that the—and I don't know about you all, but I'm still fired up, and I'm still ready to go. Admittedly, I will take a vacation for a couple weeks after my Presidency is over, but then, we're going to get back to work.\nAnd for any of you who doubt, by the way, how quickly things can change and how fast the clouds can part, you remember that speech I gave in Boston. It was a pretty good speech, and I ended up winning the U.S. Senate race, an unknown State senator up until that point. And when I arrived in Washington in 2005, I was sworn in and everybody was really happy, and I was really proud. That was also the same time where John Kerry had lost a really close election, Tom Daschle had lost his seat and was no longer a leader in the Senate. I think Ken Salazar and I were the only two Democrats across the country that had won. Republicans controlled the Senate and the House and the Presidency. Things were looking pretty bleak. Two years later, Democrats were taking over Congress, and 4 years later, I was President of the United States.\nSo I've seen it. And the reason that happens is because of all of you. And that's why I'm proud of you and that's why I'm proud to be a Democrat. Let's learn our lessons, lick our wounds, brush ourselves off, and then, we'll get back to work. All right?\nThank you, guys.", "timestamp": "2016-11-14", "title": "Remarks During a Conference Call With Democratic National Committee Stakeholders"}

More than half of everything we throw away gets permanently discarded, packing landfills across our country with trash that can take centuries to decompose and provides no utility. Today, we resolve to raise awareness of the important role that reducing, reusing, and recycling can play in achieving a more sustainable future.\nRecycling is a process that allows materials that would otherwise be thrown out to be manufactured into new materials that can be used again. By decreasing landfill waste and conserving important natural resources, recycling can mitigate pollution, save energy, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Many items such as paper, plastics, and batteries are commonly known to be recyclable, but many other products—including oil and tires—can also be recycled. In addition to helping reduce our environmental footprint, recycling also strengthens our economy and creates hundreds of thousands of green jobs. To learn more about what can be recycled and ways to encourage recycling in your community, visit www.EPA.gov/Recycle.\nPeople of all ages can do their part by reducing waste and reusing items. In our homes we can compost food and yard waste rather than sending it to a landfill; in schools we can utilize reusable containers for storing lunches and school supplies; and in workplaces we can print more documents double-sided and on recycled paper, or opt for digital copies rather than printing in the first place. The Federal Government is doing our part to lead by example—from helping businesses purchase recycled materials to assisting grocery stores, schools, and stadiums with reducing their food waste, we are striving to give businesses, States, and local governments the resources they need to encourage recycling across our Nation.\nOne of the most important things we can do with our time on Earth is to make it better for future generations. On America Recycles Day, we renew our commitment to making environmentally conscious changes in our lives so that our children and grandchildren can live that better, cleaner future. Let us continue striving to reduce waste, conserve resources, and meet our obligations to our planet and to future generations.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 15, 2016, as America Recycles Day. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate programs and activities, and I encourage all Americans to continue their reducing, reusing, and recycling efforts throughout the year.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-11-14", "title": "Proclamation 9543—America Recycles Day, 2016"}

However, consistent with U.S. commitments specified in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the United States is no longer pursuing efforts to reduce Iran's sales of crude oil. The United States action to fulfill these commitments became effective upon reaching Implementation Day under the JCPOA, which occurred once the International Atomic Energy Agency verified that Iran had implemented key nuclear-related steps specified in the JCPOA to ensure that its nuclear program is and will remain exclusively peaceful.\nI will continue to monitor this situation closely.\nThe Secretary of State is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-11-14", "title": "Presidential Determination Pursuant to Section 1245(d)(4)(B) and (C) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012"}

All right, that's enough, that's enough. You guys, please. (Applause.) Thank you for that. (Laughter.) Oh, my goodness. Now I'm embarrassed. (Laughter.)\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you! Why are you up there?\nMRS. OBAMA: I don't know. (Laughter.) It's just the lights, the cameras, you guys. (Laughter.)\nWell, hello, everyone. Welcome to the White House for the 2016 National Arts and Humanities Youth Program awards. (Applause.) Are you guys excited?\nAUDIENCE: Yes!\nMRS. OBAMA: I am too. (Laughter.) So I hope everybody has been treating you all well. You're satisfied? No complaints? Because I can still fire people. (Laughter.) Would never do that. (Laughter.)\nWelcome. Let me start by thanking from the bottom of my heart, oh, gosh, so many people. But I want to start with George Stevens, oh, who has just been an amazing friend and partner. (Applause.) And sitting beside him, Margo Lion. Oh, my god, Margo. (Applause.) It's been a really neat journey, hasn't it? Yeah, it has been.\nI want to recognize Mary Schmidt Campbell, who could not be here today. But she has been just a tremendous support. (Applause.) And Megan Beyer, who stepped in -- (applause) -- and has just been an amazing addition to the team. Megan, thank you. Thank you for your passion and your focus. I love you, I love you.\nAnd to the entire President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities -- this is my team. These are my people here. I was just talking to them earlier -- I mean, we have done some amazing things together. It's been a tremendous ride. And, oh, I can't tell you how much fun it's been to just do great things for kids all over this country. And I couldn't have done it without you. Thank you, not just for the work that you've done on this event, but for everything that you've done for the past eight years.\nFrom the day we started, all of us, we've made it a priority to open up this house to as many young people from as many backgrounds as possible, because we wanted them to understand that this is their house too. (Applause.) And that's not always the case. There are kids all over this country, all over the world who think that places like this are not for them. So they're intimidated by it, and it defines the limits of who they can be.\nWell, we want to change that. We've worked to change that. We want them to know that they should always feel home within these walls and so many important institutions all over the world. At the same time, we also wanted to bring exciting arts programming to students across the country, and to get more kids engaged in the arts at their schools and also in their communities.\nAnd the PCAH has been at the heart of both of these efforts. We've done just some really cool things. The Turnaround Arts Talent Show, which is one of my favorite things -- just having kids doing their thing up here in front of George and Martha. (Laughter.) The National Student Poet program, which highlights just some of the most amazingly gifted young people you ever want to see, to the Creative Youth Development Partnership, to the awards that we're giving out today. (Applause.)\nFor these awards in the -- for the past eight years, 3,000 programs have applied for just these awards. And we've honored more than 100 programs from 33 cities -- 33 states, D.C., and nine countries. And we couldn't have done any of this without the PCAH -- for everything. Their energy, their focus, their commitment -- you guys have just gone above and beyond every step of the way. And that's not always the case for committees. Some people just like to see their name on some stationery, but not this team. So I want to thank you for making this all possible. I hope that you're proud of what you've accomplished, because I'm so proud of you. And it's been just a great ride.\nI also want to acknowledge the other folks who are here who have been sponsors, who have been tremendous resources and partners -- folks from the NEA, from the NEH, the folks from the Institute of Museum and Library Services. We've done some great things together. Ambassador Cabaсas, who is here, from -- representing his country. They're getting a wonderful award. Thank you all for helping us recognize outstanding afterschool programs across the country.\nAnd finally, I want to thank all of the teachers and administrators, all the volunteers who make these programs possible. Some of you are here today with us in this room, and many of you are watching and cheering from back home. And as someone who used to be an executive director of a nonprofit organization, I know that you all are the unsung heroes of these programs, doing the unrecognized and sometimes unpaid work of making these programs work -- filling out countless forms, applying for funding, attending endless meetings, going over spreadsheets and budgets in the middle of the night.\nThis kind of work is hard. Too often it's thankless. But you all do it because you see firsthand the transformative impact that the arts can have on our young people. And we're grateful to you all for doing this kind of work.\nThrough your programs, students have become poets and dancers. They've become filmmakers and photographers. And more importantly, they become leaders in their schools and in their communities. They've written scripts and short stories. They've organized performances and exhibitions. And together, they've learned the power of discipline, of hard work, right? And teamwork, right?\nThese are the exact skills that are critical to success not just in the arts, but in everything -- every academic subject that you are going to touch and in any career that you guys are going to pursue. So you don't know how much you're getting, but we do because we're old. We know. (Laughter.) That's why kids who have gotten involved in the arts have better grades. They are more likely to graduate from high school. They are more likely to then go on to college.\nAnd to anyone who still somehow doubts the power of the arts to transform students' lives, to anyone who still isn't completely convinced, I just urge you to find one of these students and talk to them. They're here today, but they're not just here, but they're all over the country. They're in communities everywhere.\nBut we've got a couple. We've got Noemi Negron, who is here. As recently as this spring, Noemi was a promising young woman growing up in Boston who wanted to serve others but didn't know where to start. But then she got involved with the IBA Youth Development Program, and she helped make a video project about women's rights. And today, she is a passionate advocate for social justice in her community. That's where you can go with programs like these.\nWe have a young man, Rafael Bitanga, who is here all the way from Kodiak, Alaska. How was that trip? (Laughter.) A few years ago, Rafael and his family came to the United States from the Philippines. And like so many young people who've immigrated to this country, Rafael worked hard in school and quickly established himself as a leader and a role model. And through the Baranov Museum and Film Intensive, he became both a filmmaker and a photographer, and he even started his own photography business to help support his family.\nSo Noemi and Rafael, and -- I could you about every single student or young person who is here today, but those are some of the stories that you'll hear from them. And I want them all to know how proud I am of them. I'm proud of you guys, always proud of you guys. You make this job worth doing, just having the honor of getting to meet so many amazing young people.\nThese kids represent the very best of America, and they remind us all of who we really are. (Applause.) That's for you. You can't even believe it, right? (Laughter.) It's all for you.\nBut we're a country that believes in our young people -- all of them. We believe that every single child has boundless promise, no matter who they are, where they come from, or how much money their parents have. We've got to remember that. We believe that each of these young people is a vital part of the great American story. I can't say that enough. (Applause.)\nAnd it is important to our continued greatness to see these kids as ours -- not as \"them,\" not as \"other,\" but as ours. Because we want them to know that if they're willing to work for it -- and so many are -- that they can be anything they want. That's what this country is about. And we can never forget that. Anywhere in the country, these kids are ours. And that's really the power of programs like these. That's the message that they send to our young people every single day.\nSo I want to end by once again thanking all of you -- all the adults here too -- (laughter) -- for making these programs possible. And I want to thank all of the young people for working so hard. And don't ever lose hope. Don't ever feel fear. You belong here, you got that? (Applause.) Those people are clapping for you. So don't forget that -- for all of you. Remember that. Remember that part of this day. And keep working hard, because it's going to be so important now to be educated and focused. Because no one can ever take your education from you. You got that? Spread the word, you got it? I'm looking at all of you all. (Laughter.)\nSo it's time to get this show on the road. So it is my pleasure to welcome to the stage someone who's been an outstanding partner in the work that we've done -- the co-chair of the PCAH, my dear friend, George Stevens. (Applause.)\n(The program continues.)\nMRS. OBAMA: Oh, wow. All right, drop the mic. (Laughter.) You could tell they were serious, right? They came up, they took their time, they tuned their instruments. You were playing with the bottom of your thing, and -- wow. (Laughter.)\nYou know, see, this is why we do what we do. Because if anybody were to walk past these kids on the street, they would make assumptions about what they could do and who they could be. And we do that all the time to each other and to our kids. We put them in boxes and in baskets and we place lids on them, and we don't let them out because of our issues.\nAll of these young people have some kind of potential in them. And if we don't invest in them as a nation, regardless of where they come from or what color they are, if we don't invest in them, we lose. Imagine this talent bottled up in these kids unexplored, uninvested. There are millions of kids like this in this country who do not have the resources to become everything that they could be. And shame on us if we can't do this better.\nBut fortunately, these programs are doing the job that sometimes the bigger society fails to do. And so we capture this magic in a bottle. You guys are phenomenal. And you're very cute too. (Laughter and applause.)\nSo that was amazing -- amazing. There is nothing that any of you can't do. This is what you have to do. You have to stay in school. You have to. You have to go to college. You have to get your degree. Because that's the one thing people can't take away from you, is your education. And it is worth the investment.\nSo stay focused. School and music and the arts is the only thing that matters -- not what kind of clothes you wear, what kind of swag you've got -- even though these guys have a lot of swag. (Laughter.) I will say that. So you got your shows. You can be smart and talented and have a whole lot of swag to go along with it.\nThank you all. This was a wonderful last -- so many lasts that we're having, but this was one of the best. And again, I want to thank you all for the work that you do, for the love that you show our kids, for the faith that you have in our nation. And I invite you all to stay for a reception -- is that right? We're having a reception? I don't want to invite you to something that we're not having. (Laughter.) I never know what's going on in this house, but there is a reception. (Laughter.)\nSo feel free to stay. You guys get to eat, okay? There's food right? (Laughter.) You can eat. Stay and enjoy yourselves.\nThank you guys. To all our young people, way to go! (Applause.) This has been a blast. We're going to find ways to keep doing this long after we leave the White House.\nYou all, thank you so much. Have a great day.

We value Greece as a democratic and stable member of the Euro-Atlantic family, as a NATO ally, and as a member state of the European Union. The United States is committed to assisting the Greek people and government by supporting efforts to place the Greek economy on a path to sustainability and renewed prosperity. The United States also acknowledges and commends the Greek government and people for their generous response to the refugee and migration crisis. We remain committed to advancing Greece's response through our support for international humanitarian organizations.\nEconomic and Trade Partners: As Greece moves forward on the path to economic recovery, the United States will advocate policies to promote and foster economic growth and further opportunities for U.S. investment. To further these goals, the United States has pledged its support for energy diversification in Greece through the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline and Greece-Bulgaria Interconnector, which reduce Europe's dependence on Russian gas and strengthen energy security across the region. The Southern Gas Corridor also provides new hope and opportunity for stability and prosperity. To expand economic opportunity, the U.S. Embassy in Greece has also partnered with Massachusetts Institute of Technology Enterprise Forum and the Hellenic Initiative to support training for entrepreneurs in Greece. Since 2013, the United States has brought Greek entrepreneurs and creative professionals to the South by Southwest (SXSW) innovation festival in Austin, Texas, where they pitched their ideas to potential investors. Six of the SXSW participants raised more than $20 million to fund their start-ups. With U.S. support, Greek entrepreneurs also participated in the June 2016 Global Entrepreneurship Summit. These programs offered both Greek and American citizens many opportunities for increased cooperation between our two countries.\nSecurity Partners: Greece joins the United States in its commitment to fighting ISIL. As long-time NATO allies, the United States and Greece remain committed to enhancing regional security and bolstering defense cooperation. The United States provides military assistance to Greece through the International Military Education Training program, which forges lasting relationships between Greece's emerging military leaders and their U.S. counterparts. Additionally, Greece hosts Naval Support Activity Souda Bay on the island of Crete - an important military installation that supports the regional objectives of the United States and NATO. Greece's demonstrated commitment to meeting its NATO obligations to invest at least two percent of its GDP in defense spending and its history of cooperation with the United States make it one of our most steadfast allies. The United States and Greece have also increased cooperation in law-enforcement information sharing to detect and deter transnational criminals, including terrorists, through the implementation of a Secure Real Time Platform program to allow Greek authorities to screen immigrants, asylum seekers, or refugees entering Greece against U.S. databases. We have undertaken these efforts to increase the mutual security of our two countries.\nPartners in Education, Science, and Innovation: The United States funds numerous fellowships and exchanges in Greece. The Greek Fulbright Program is the oldest in Europe, and the second oldest worldwide. It affords Greek citizens the opportunity to travel to the United States and for American students and scholars to study in Greece. We have worked together to expand educational exchange opportunities for Greeks in the United States and in programs that bring U.S. experts on migration to Greece. In 2018, the Fulbright program will mark its 70th anniversary of exchanges between the United States and Greece. The United States Agency for International Development will provide $300,000 in grant funding to the American College of Greece in support of a Simulated Trading Center that will replicate a real-world trading experience and function as a classroom and laboratory. This project will provide a cutting-edge educational tool to the future business leaders and entrepreneurs of Greece.\nPartners in Humanitarian Response: The United States remains dedicated to supporting the Greek government's ongoing efforts to accommodate refugees and migrants. Since the start of Europe's refugee crisis, the United States has contributed over $44 million in humanitarian aid through international organizations. Parallel to these efforts, the United States partnered with Greece and other European countries to exchange refugee resettlement and integration experiences through a variety of fora.\nIn response to the President's Call to Action for Private Sector Engagement on the Global Refugee Crisis, eleven companies committed to supporting activities in Greece. These included: AirBnB, Cisco, Cosmote, Facebook, Google, Libra Group, Microsoft, Uber, UPS, Vodaphone, and Western Union. These companies will work to ensure WiFi connectivity, set up mobile charging stations in refugee and migrant centers, and support refugee education and the overall response of international humanitarian organizations.\nPresident Obama has advocated for the international community to ensure migrants and refugees have access to work and education opportunities. The State Department has announced it will provide $725,000 for scholarships for up to 200 migrant and refugee students in Thessaloniki and Athens to attend classes at U.S.-affiliated universities in Greece. As we are able to demonstrate the program's success, we hope the Greek-American diaspora community will contribute to this cause to make it a long-term sustainable program to provide lasting education opportunities for this refugee population.\nIn October 2016, the State Department launched the European Regional Integration Technical Assistance Program, a new program that will share U.S. best practices in refugee resettlement and integration with local-level practitioners and policy makers in ten European States developing new or expanding existing resettlement and integration programs, including Greece. Our implementing partner, the International Rescue Committee will begin working with local partners in Greece under this program starting in early 2017. These contributions reflect and demonstrate the U.S. commitment to addressing the humanitarian needs of the migrants and refugees in Greece.", "timestamp": "2016-11-15", "title": "Fact Sheet: U.S. - Greek Partnership"}

These are the characteristics which define your international acclaim and appeal.\nYour acclaim and appeal are, of course, justified by, among others, your initiatives of dealing with a deep global economic crisis; the support of the social rule of law; management of the acute and, in your own words, epic refugee crisis with humanity and justice; and cracking down on the barbarity of terrorism, dealing in an appropriate manner with countless criminals who commit crimes against humanity.\nMr. President, our peoples are bound by truly historic ties of friendship and cooperation, which have become even stronger thanks to the great Greek American community of which we Greeks are very proud, and for which we always have feelings of great gratitude. With this opportunity, I would like to thank you warmly for your solidarity to Greece and to the Greek people throughout this deep and painful economic and social crisis that our country suffered. I am certain that your successor, the new President of the United States, Mr. Trump, will continue on the same path.\nMr. President, in these difficult times for mankind, mankind stands to benefit a great deal from the close and sincere cooperation between the United States and the European Union. We are convinced that the U.S. has every reason to look forward to a strong and prosperous Europe. Greece is committed to this direction. Despite the hardship and the huge sacrifices of the people—which, it should be noted, are not only the result of our own errors—we remain firm on the course of the European Union and of the euro zone. We strive to make all our partners understand that it is our duty to stay on the path of European integration, far from phobic syndromes and lack of solidarity, which can only undermine our common European future. We are deeply inspired by the European ideal, and we defend our national interests not only on the basis of international law as a whole, but also on the basis of European primary law and secondary legislation.\nWe deal with our national issues within this primary and secondary legislation. And therefore I'd like to point out three examples of what we call our national issues. The Cyprus issue, which is, of course, first and foremost, an international and European issue can only bear a result through full respect of the European institutional hierarchy, and we are in favor of a speedy resolution based on a fair and viable solution.\nThe institutional hierarchy obviously excludes a confederate solution or occupation armies and obsolete guarantees, which deprive the modern concept of sovereignty of its meaning. We should also not forget that the solution of the Cyprus issue that does not respect those facts would create a very negative precedent for the existence and the sovereignty of every member state. This is primary European law, and this precedent could put at risk all of the individual member states. We also deem that any dispute of the Treaty of Lausanne is inconceivable and unacceptable since it would be a blatant violation of international law, for which the treaty was part, and would undermine not only the borders of Greece, but also of the European Union, since the borders of the European Union, Mr. President, are the borders of individual member states.\nFinally, the fact that the neighboring state is claiming a name, which, besides falsifying history, obviously constitutes irredentist behavior and therefore indirectly questions existing borders; this goes against international and European law and undermines its own European perspective.\nMr. President, I would once again like to welcome you. And I reserve the words that befit your personality and your work for tonight's dinner. I wish you a pleasant stay in Athens. And let me assure you that we Greeks always, even after the end of your term, think of you as a statesman of world class and a great friend of Greece and of the Greek people.\nPresident Obama. Well, Mr. President, I just want to thank you for the warm welcome and thank the Greek people for hosting us here today. I send greetings from all Americans, but as you noted, we have an extraordinary Greek American community that is very excited about this visit.\nThis, as you noted, will be my last foreign trip. And I thought it was very appropriate for us to visit a great country that is the birthplace of democracy, the source of so many of the ideals and values that helped to build America, and an outstanding friend and ally.\nObviously, Greece has gone through very challenging economic times over the last several years. And it has been the policy of my administration to do everything we can to work with the Greek Government and the Greek people to restore growth and optimism and to alleviate hardship. And we are glad to see that progress is being made, although we recognize that there are significant challenges ahead, and we intend to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Greek people throughout this process.\nWe believe that a strong, prosperous, and unified Europe is not only good for the people of Europe, but good for the world and good for the United States. And we also believe that it's important that all people have opportunity and inclusion in growth inside of Europe. And part of my message as I travel not just to Greece but to meet with other European leaders is to encourage a process that ensures opportunity for all, particularly for the youth of Europe and youth here in Greece.\nI also want to extend the world's appreciation for the humanitarian and compassionate manner that Greece has dealt with the severe migration and refugee crisis that's been taking place.\nAs I said at the U.N. Summit on Refugees that I hosted in September, it's important that we don't have any single country bear the entire burden of these challenges; that all of us are contributing and participating in alleviating suffering, and dealing with migration in an orderly and compassionate way. And we have been very glad to partner with the Greek Government in managing the situation appropriately.\nAnd finally, whether it's dealing with terrorism, addressing some of the challenges that are occurring in the Middle East, hosting our naval vessels, cooperation in the Aegean Sea, the strong NATO relationship between the United States in Greece is of the utmost importance. And I want to reaffirm not only our appreciation for the Greek people in that alliance, but\nunderscore how important we consider the transatlantic alliance. It continues to be a cornerstone of our security that is unwavering and it is something that provides significant continuity. Even as we see a transition of Governments in the United States, across Democratic and Republican administrations, there's a recognition that the NATO alliance is absolutely vital and the transatlantic relationship is the cornerstone of our mutual security as well as prosperity.\nSo, in addition to the formal meetings, I also hope to get a chance to see the Acropolis, because if you come to Greece, you've got to do a little bit of sightseeing.\nSo thank you, again, for your very gracious hospitality and thanks to the Greek people for the friendship and the partnership that has made both our countries stronger.", "timestamp": "2016-11-15", "title": "Remarks Prior to a Meeting With President Prokopios Pavlopoulos of Greece in Athens, Greece"}

I want to thank the American President, Barack Obama, very warmly for visiting Greece and for choosing Athens, the birthplace of democracy, for his—for one of his last stops before concluding his 8-year term as the American President.\nThe Presidency, during which the image of the United States of America around the world has changed—even in this country, where, during the cold war era, Greek American relations were—have accumulated heavy, historic burden—a very heavy, historical burden. And I think it was a historic moment when, during the previous visit of an American President in Greece in 1999, President Clinton recognized the errors of the U.S. as regards the dictatorship in Greece. Because the American—the Greek people do not only relate to the ancient traditions; they have fought—they have shed blood until recently—to defend the values of democracy and freedom, which are our common values.\nTherefore, Greece is now welcoming an American President who, throughout his term in office, has strongly defended these values; who has fought for the rights of all people, irrespective of color, religion, or sexual orientation; who has worked in order to deal with climate change; a President who has integrated millions of Americans into health care; a President who has put his strength and his influence behind a humanitarian solution of the great refugee crisis, the greatest after World War II.\nAnd I should also like to point out—because this is very important to Greece—this is a President who, in—when he had to deal with the 2008 economic crisis, has led the American economy on a completely different path than the one that Europe has chosen. Eight years later, the result is more than visible. Quantitative easing, commitment to employment, which was the choice of the United States, have led to impressive growth rates and decline in unemployment. While on the other side, the insistence of European leaders to austerity policies keeps the European economies trapped in stagnation, and it, therefore, brings about huge political and social problems.\nAnd it is in this respect that I had the opportunity to discuss with President Obama about the huge challenges that our country—but also the whole of Europe—is dealing with. These are challenges that needs to be dealt with collectively, decisively, and effectively. Otherwise, we will be led to—backwards from a political and a social point of view.\nWe have, therefore, agreed that for the modern society—for modern societies to have help—and hope and aspirations is the only reply against the increasing trend in skepticism and inward looking, which is a threat to modern democracies. The international community, when trying to avoid historic mistakes of the past, saw this issue clearly when, in 1953, and with the assistance and support of the United States of America, they settled the German debt and they linked it to a growth clause. Today, the strong Germany, which is the powerhouse of—financial powerhouse of Europe, should think in the same manner.\nGreece and the Greek people have recently had to deal with the most—the harshest consequences of the global and European economic crisis. As an economy and as a society, we have had to experience a program of disastrous austerity, which made the problems more acute instead of resolving them. Within a few years, we have lost 25 percent of our GDP, while in 2004, unemployment went up to 27 percent.\nToday—and despite what we have suffered—we are still standing. We were able, through great sacrifices, to avoid the threats and the threatened disaster, and we are, step by step, restoring our economy. Today, for the first time in years, we are back to growth. Slowly but surely, we are decreasing unemployment, and we are restoring confidence to the future of the Greek economy.\nAbout 18 months ago, although we were a young government, we were asked to take very difficult decisions. And with this opportunity, I want to recognize publicly the role and the contribution of President Obama, during those difficult moments, to recognize his moral and political support he gave to my government in the effort to find a political solution.\nDifficult decisions were made not only in order to keep our country in the euro zone, but also in order to maintain the cohesion of the European Union. And I believe that our decisions were right, as shown by history. We have made difficult reforms in the social security, in taxation, in public administration, but I have—we have always taken measures to fight corruption, to attract investment, to create a better context for investment in Greece.\nWe will continue to decisively promote reforms that will promote growth. And at the same time, we will continue to negotiate hard in order to avoid any reforms that would undermine growth. But what is more important to all of us is that society should understand, should feel the results of all that and to make the burden to the weak members of society lighter and also for the younger and productive generation, because after 7 years, people cannot take any more austerity.\nThe important reduction of the Greek debt, the reduction of the surpluses which are expected of us in the future, and the participation of the Bank of Greece in the quantitative easing program are rightfully—should be rightfully given to Greece. And the time to do that is now.\nAnd from this point of view, I think that it is not only symbolic, but it is also very important that Barack Obama is now in Athens and in—the day after tomorrow will be in Berlin at this very critical point in time when decisions are expected, decisions that would not only concern Greece; they concern Europe and therefore the global economy. Cooperation and solidarity are necessary requirements in order to bring about the solutions that will once again bring stability to the European integration and bring it back to the track of growth.\nAnd in relation to that, President Obama and I discussed a number of important issues, such as the continuation of our bilateral economic and business cooperation: more specifically, the important potential for investments in Greece in a series of sectors, such as energy, tourism, agro-food, research, and technology. We also discussed the future where Greece, with its important shipping power, can become an important transit center for trade, transport, and energy, linking Europe to Asia and to North Africa.\nWe also discussed the important projects underway which upgrade the role of our country in the—on the energy map, such as the TAP, the IGB pipelines, the upgrading of the LNG terminal, and the FSRU in Alexandland—in Alexandroupoli, which is now being designed. Also, we discussed the possibility of opening new natural gas corridors in the Eastern Mediterranean, which will play an important role to peace and stability in our region. We have also discussed the excellent Greek human potential—human capital—and especially young scientists. We have stressed the huge potential opening from—for the cooperation between the American and the Greek business communities in the fields of innovation and startup companies in Greece. And we have also discussed the current regional developments, the great challenges in security, migration, the need to strengthen our cooperation on these issues.\nWe have discussed the critical role that Greece plays as a pillar of peace and security in a region where stabilization is on the grow. Me—it's a country of Europe, of the Eastern Mediterranean, of the Balkans, of the wider Black Sea neighborhood, which promotes—steadily promotes—bilateral and, alongside Cyprus, the tripartite cooperation with all the countries of the region on the basis of international law; a country which is using its role as an active member of the EU and NATO to promote peace, stability and security in the region, and which is gradually strengthening its role in order to promote border security and cooperation against terrorism.\nA country which, despite its financial difficulties, has offered support to hundreds of thousands of refugees who arrived on its shores. A country when—which, when the Balkan corridor was unilaterally closed, and despite the pressure exercised on it to violate our common values, still insists that the only way to deal with the refugee issue is respect for international law, cooperation with transit countries and countries of origin, and dealing with the origins of migration—with the reasons of migration. And in this framework, we have discussed the importance of implementing the EU-Turkey agreement and continuation of NATO operations in the Aegean.\nWe have stressed the needs to do whatever possible to promote peace and stability in Syria, Iraq, and Libya. The hardship, the fighting against civilians should stop, and terrorism should be fought decisively.\nWe have also stressed the need to restart the credible talks on the Middle East issue. And in this framework, I have underscored my commitment to dialogue and cooperation with our neighboring Turkey, a country that plays important role for the future of our region. But I still stressed that the promotion of these important relations can only take place on the basis of mutual respect, without threats of war and questioning of sovereign rights.\nAnd of course, we have discussed the Cyprus issue: the need to find a fair and viable solution on the basis of U.N. resolutions and the—compatible with the fact that Cyprus is an EU member state. We have therefore expressed our support to the very important, critical bicommunal talks which are underway. Tomorrow I will be meeting President Anastasiadis, who will be in Athens.\nWe need to be very careful at this very critical point in relation to these talks, because important issues are still pending. Our objective is to achieve a solution that will benefit all of the Cypriots and a solution that will promote the confidence building on the island. And this, in our view, cannot happen without the departure of the occupation army and without doing away with the obsolete system of guarantees.\nSo, before I conclude, I should like to once more thank President Obama for opting to visit our country. I would like now to remember the words of another important American President, who, during the previous century, had to fight in order to deal with challenges similar to the current ones: security, economic crisis, or migration of movements of populations. And he had said that real freedom for people can only exist whenever there is\nsecurity and independence. And he had only said—he has also said that famine and unemployment are the raw material for dictatorships. These words are very topical nowadays. And I am certain about peoples who are committed to common values will fight in any—in every way to deter any possibility of us going back into history.\nIt is our duty to make a leap into the future, and I believe that we will make it. Thank you.\nPresident Obama. Kalispera. [Laughter] Thank you, Prime Minister Tsipras, for your kind words and for welcoming me to Athens today. I've always wanted to come to Greece, and I'm delighted to be able to make this part of my last trip overseas as President of the United States.\nI think we all know that the world owes an enormous debt to Greece and the Greek people. So many of our ideas of democracy, so much of our literature and philosophy and science can be traced back to roots right here in Athens. I'm told there is a saying from those ancient times—kalos kai agathos—when someone or something is good and beautiful on the outside, but it's also good and noble on the inside, in terms of character and in terms of purpose. And I think that's a fine description of the friendship that exists between the Greek people and the American people.\nThe ideas of ancient Greece helped inspire America's Founding Fathers as they reached for democracy. Our revolutionary ideas helped inspire Greeks as they sought their own freedom, and Americans came here to help fight for Greek independence. At the dawn of the cold war, when President Truman committed the United States to the defense of Greece, he said, \"I believe that we must assist free peoples to work out their own destinies in their own way.\"\nTo this day, the United States is profoundly grateful for our friendship and alliance with Greece. And I'm personally very grateful to my many friends in the Greek American community, sons and daughters of Hellenes who have found success in every walk of American life. And, Alexios, I want to thank you for your commitment to our alliance and for the good work that we did today.\nAs the Prime Minister already noted, we spent much of our time discussing the economic situation here in Greece and how Greece can continue to move forward. I know this has been a painful and difficult time, especially for Greek workers and families, pensioners and young people. This crisis is not an abstraction, but has had a very concrete and devastating impact on the lives and livelihoods of millions of people across this country.\nIn our meeting, Alexios outlined next steps, including reforms to make Greece more attractive to investment and to prevent the kind of imbalances that led to the debt crisis in the first place. In other words, Greece, under his leadership, continues to do the hard work necessary to recover.\nAt the same time, I've been clear from the beginning of this crisis that in order to make reforms sustainable, the Greek economy needs the space to return to growth and start creating jobs again. We cannot simply look to austerity as a strategy. And it is incredibly important that the Greek people see improvements in their daily lives so that they can carry with them the hope that their lives will get better.\nAnd in this context, as Greece continues reform, the IMF has said that debt relief is crucial. I will continue to urge creditors to take the steps needed to put Greece on a path towards a durable economic recovery, because it's in all of our interests that Greece succeeds. We all want the Greek people to prosper, to be able to provide a good life for their families and their children. That would be good for Greece. That would be good for the European Union, good for the United States, and ultimately, good for the world.\nBeyond economic issues, we discussed the pressing security challenges that we face as NATO allies. I want to take this opportunity to commend Greece for being one of the five NATO allies that spends 2 percent of GDP of defense, a goal that we have consistently set, but not everybody has met. Greece has done this even during difficult economic times. If Greece can meet this NATO commitment, all our allies should be able to do so.\nWe also discussed the need to continue sharing intelligence to help prevent terrorist attacks; the importance of keeping sanctions, including EU sanctions, in place until Russia has fully implemented the Minsk agreement, along with Ukraine.\nAs I did privately with Alexios, I want to thank the Greek people publicly for their humanitarian response to the crisis of so many migrants and refugees seeking safety in Europe. Greeks, especially on the islands, have shown extraordinary compassion, and they've rightly earned the admiration of the world. Again, Greeks have done so even as they've faced their own great economic hardships. And that's a testament, I think, to their solidarity and commitment to treating people with kindness and fairness.\nPrime Minister Tsipras has made commitments to increase housing for unaccompanied children and to improve access to education for children who are migrants and refugees. And in these goals, it's an obligation of the United States to help, because this cannot be viewed just as a Greek problem, this is an international problem. And I reaffirmed my support to help in any ways that we can, including reaffirming America's support for the deal between the EU and Turkey that can manage arrivals in Europe in a way that is orderly and humane.\nFinally, as Alexios mentioned, we discussed Cyprus, where the prospects for a just, comprehensive, and lasting settlement are the best that they've been for some time. It doesn't mean that success is guaranteed, but the possibility of resolving a decades-long conflict is there. And we urge the parties to continue their work. The interests of all Cypriots would be advanced with a bizonal, bicommunal federation. We're hopeful that a solution that's durable, which would create new economic opportunities for all the people across Cyprus is within reach. And it would be a powerful example to the world of what's possible with diplomacy and compromise.\nSo, again, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for welcoming me. Thank you for your partnership. The Greek people have gone through some very difficult times, and there's still a hard road ahead. But despite those hardships, Greece has continued to be a reliable ally, has shown true compassion to fellow human beings in need. It's an example of the Greek character. And I'm looking forward to the opportunity to say more to the Greek people in a speech that I'll deliver tomorrow. For now, on behalf of the American people, just let me say that we are proud to count Greece as one of our closest allies and one of our greatest friends.\nSo efharisto. [Laughter]\nModerator. We will now proceed to questions. There will be two questions from Greek media and two questions from American media. First question, Mr. Charitos from ERT [Panos Charitos, ERT], the state TV.\nU.S. Economy/Greece's Economy Q. I want to take you 7, 8 years back, when you entered the White House, the unemployment—the rates of the unemployment, it was 6 percent, the next 2 years up to 11.6, and today, you managed to leave it back with 5 percent, which is the lowest ever.\nPresident Obama. Four-point-nine.\nQ. Four-point-nine. [Laughter] The GDP of your country, you managed to grow it almost 3—2.6 trillion. So, on the contrary—of course, there is nothing to compare between Greek and United States economy—but on the contrary, Greece, the last 7 years is following the treatment of the financial institutions—the foreign financial institutions, and we're still in the eye of the storm of the recession. So, in the same time, there is no discussion about the debt relief. So my question is, how far this economy can go with this reform programs without any discussion of the debt relief? How far this relationship between Greece and the foreign institutions can last?\nPresident Obama. Well, you're right that it—you can't entirely compare between the United States and Greece for a range of reasons, not just because of the size of the economy. We went through a very severe contraction. We were losing 800,000 jobs a month when I came into office. In fact, the economy was contracting faster than it did during the Great Depression. But we were able to intervene, apply lessons learned, and stabilize and then begin growth again.\nBut I do believe that one of the lessons we tried to apply is that it is important to combine structural reforms and good fiscal stewardship with a growth strategy. Because when your economy is growing and more revenue is coming in, that helps relieve debt. And sometimes, if your only approach is cutting spending at a time when the economy is contracting, then the economy will contract further, and that could add debt.\nNow, the advantage we had is that the dollar is the reserve currency of the world. Even in the midst of crisis, people were still buying U.S. Treasury bills. We were not part of a broader arrangement like the euro zone. So it gave us some additional flexibility.\nAnd—but the key lesson that we've drawn from our experience—and it's true that we recovered faster and better, frankly, than most of Europe—is that particularly when the economy is still struggling, putting people back to work, finding ways to spur economic activity ultimately can help to reduce the structural deficits and debts that countries experience.\nI think the path that Greece is currently on is the right one. You've engaged in some very difficult structural reforms. And I think the Greek people—although it is difficult and challenging, and the politics of it, I know, are not good—should appreciate the fact that in this global economy, the Greek economy was going to have to go through some structural reforms. We all do, all the time. The United States has to go through structural reforms in terms of improving our education system or revamping our infrastructure or looking at some regulations that weren't properly controlling excesses on Wall Street. So we initiated—or health care reform—we had to initiate a whole range of structural reforms.\nThey're not the same as the ones that Greece has had to do, but these were necessary reforms. And the Prime Minister and his government being willing to move forward on those, I think will lead to Greece being more competitive and a more attractive place for investment in the future. Look, and the Greek people are entrepreneurial. There are enormous resources in this country. My hope is, is that more and more investors around the world see an opportunity to do business here in Greece. But even as you have those structural reforms, our argument has always been that when an economy contracted this fast, when unemployment is this high, that there also has to be a growth agenda to go with it. And it is very difficult to imagine the kind of growth strategy that's needed without some debt-relief mechanism.\nNow, the politics of this are difficult in Europe. And I think in fairness to some of the governments up north that I know are not always popular here in Greece, it's important to recognize that they have their own politics. And their populations and their institutions often are resistant to some of these debt-relief formulas.\nBut I think that having seen Greece begin many of these difficult steps toward structural reform, having shown a commitment to change, with the Greek people having endured some significant hardships for many years now, there should be an opportunity, I think, for both sides to recognize that if we can come up with a durable solution, as opposed to each year or every 6 months having a new negotiation, that that could potentially be good for everyone. And now that the Greek economy is growing again, the timing may be right.\nWhite House Press Secretary Joshua R. Earnest. The first question from a White House reporter will come from Jerome Cartillier of AFP [Agence France-Presse]. Jerome.\n2016 U.S. Presidential Election/United Kingdom Referendum Vote To Leave the European Union/International Populist Movements/Economic Globalization\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President.\nPresident Obama. Yes.\nQ. A lot of people in Europe are still struggling to understand what happened on November 8 in the United States. Do you believe it's the exact same dynamic as Brexit, which happened 6 months before? And does it have to do with leaders struggling to read the mood of their country? Do you have the feeling that, while in power, you underestimated anger or resentment or fear in America?\nAnd to you, Prime Minister Tsipras, President Obama has repeatedly said, including today, that Greece should get substantial debt relief. From your conversation with him today, do you—are you hopeful that he might convince Chancellor Merkel to make a move in that regard later this week?\nPresident Obama. No two countries are identical. And obviously, there's a difference between a referendum on a very complex relationship between Great Britain and the rest of Europe and a Presidential election in the United States.\nPresidential elections always turn on personalities. They turn on how campaigns are run. They turn on natural desires for change. If you've had an incumbent who has been there for 8 years, there's a temptation to think, well, let's maybe make a change. I think there are a whole range of factors involved.\nBut I do think that there is a common theme that we've seen in a lot of advanced economies and that we've seen around the world, although they manifest themselves in different ways. Globalization, combined with technology, combined with social media and constant information, have disrupted people's lives, sometimes in very concrete ways—a manufacturing plant closes, and suddenly, an entire town no longer has what was the primary source of employment—but also psychologically. People are less certain of their national identities or their place in the world. It starts looking different and disorienting. And there is no doubt that that has produced populist movements, both from the left and the right, in many countries in Europe. When you see a Donald Trump and a Bernie Sanders—very unconventional candidates—have considerable success, then obviously, there's something there that's being tapped into.\nA suspicion of globalization, a desire to rein in its excesses, a suspicion of elites and governing institutions that people feel may not be responsive to their immediate needs. And that sometimes gets wrapped up in issues of ethnic identity or religious identity or cultural identity. And that can be a volatile mix.\nIt's important to recognize, though, that those trends have always been there. And it's the job, I think, of leaders to try to address people's real, legitimate concerns and channel them in the most constructive ways possible.\nDid I recognize that there was anger or frustration in the American population? Of course, I did. First of all, we had to fight back from the worst recession since the Great Depression, and I can guarantee you, if your housing values have crashed and you've lost your—most of your pension and you've lost your job, you're going to be pretty angry. And so we bought—fought back and recovered. But that left, I think, fear and anxiety in a lot of people, a sense that the economy wasn't as certain as it could be, and maybe the game was rigged on Wall Street or by special interests in Washington or what have you. And that's been there.\nI was also aware of it because of the fact that you have seen some of the rhetoric among Republican and elected officials and activists and media—some of it pretty troubling and not necessarily connected to facts, but being used effectively to mobilize people. And obviously, President-elect Trump tapped into that particular strain within the Republican Party and then was able to broaden that enough and get enough votes to win the election.\nThe lesson I draw—and I think people can draw a lot of lessons, but maybe one that cuts across countries—is, we have to deal with issues like inequality. We have to deal with issues of economic dislocation. We have to deal with people's fears that their children won't do as well as they have. The more aggressively and effectively we deal with those issues, the less those fears may channel themselves into counterproductive approaches that pit people against each other.\nAnd frankly, that was—that's been my agenda for the last 8 years. I think raising wages, investing in infrastructure, making sure that people have access to good educations that are—equip them for the jobs of the future—those are all agenda items that would help alleviate some of those economic pressures and dislocations that people are experiencing. The problem was, I couldn't convince the Republican Congress to pass a lot of them.\nNow, having said that, people seem to think I did a really—pretty good job. And so there is this mismatch, I think, between frustration and anger. Perhaps the view of the American people was, is that we just need to shake things up. Time will now tell whether the prescriptions that are being offered—whether Brexit or with respect to the U.S. election—ends up actually satisfying those people who have been fearful or angry or concerned. And I think that's going to be an interesting test, because I think I can make a pretty strong argument that the policies we put forward were the right ones; that we've grown faster than just about any advanced economy. The country is indisputably better off, and those folks who voted for the President-elect are better off than they were when I came into office, for the most part. But we'll see whether those facts affect people's calculations in the next election.\nPrime Minister Tsipras. You asked if I believe that Angela Merkel could be convinced to make on—but which are the necessary steps for the recovery of the Greek economy. Well, my answer is I'm very optimistic, and this for two reasons. Number one, Angela Merkel is a German politician, and Germans sometimes insist—sometimes they are disagreeable, but they insist—that the agreements must be honored.\nAnd what is expected to happen with Greece is that which was agreed last July, August, in the summer of 2015, that was as soon as Greece shows that it has decided to proceed with the courageous and difficult reforms, that when the first and most difficult review is completed, then decisions will be taken, measures will be implemented to reduce—to provide debt relief to Greece so that Greece can go out into the money markets and for growth to return at a very high rate in the Greek economy.\nSo the first reason for my optimism is that just as the German Finance Minister used to say, pacta sunt servanda. This is a Latin expression, which we sometimes use, where—although we have learned not Latin, but Ancient Greek in our schools.\nThe second reason for which I'm optimistic is that I have met Angela Merkel to—in person; so has Barack Obama. We worked very close together during the period of the huge refugee crisis. Our cooperation is very good, and therefore, I'm of the opinion that she is a responsible politician, a politician who has a sense of responsibility for Europe and not only for Germany or for the—her political party. And this was the manner in which she dealt with the refugee crisis: with a deep sense of responsibility on the future of Europe and on stability.\nAnd for these two important reasons, I do expect that she will be convinced that these two necessary steps must be made—two steps that will not be a burden to German taxpayers—so that Greece can become not a member—a part of the problem, but a part of the solution for security, for growth, and for resolving the refugee issue, for which Greece plays an important role.\nAnd that is why I'm optimistic, and I expect my optimism to be realized.\nModerator. Mr. Ignoti from Ethnos. Question number three.\nCyprus/U.S. Economy/European Union\nQ. It means a lot for us for you to be here. My name is Michael Ignoti. I'm the correspondent in Washington for Ethnos newspaper and Mega TV. You said many times, Mr. President, that the way the Europeans handled the economy—the economic crisis—had the opposite effect. And also, you talked many times against the austerity. And of course, you are right. Why, in your opinion, you didn't succeed to convince the Europeans to follow your way? And what are you going to do the last 2 months to help Greece and the Greek people? Also, I have a short question about Cyprus. Both of you, you talk about Cyprus. And it's a dear issue for me because I born in Cyprus. How can you convince the President of Turkey to end the occupation of Cyprus, Mr. President?\nPresident Obama. Well, let me take the second question first. This is ultimately a negotiation between Cypriots: Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots. And the good news is that you have two leaders who seem genuinely committed to finding compromises and an approach that would serve both their peoples well. If in fact you can see a meeting of the minds between them, then the issue will be can we make sure that all of us, the international community—Turkey, Greece, the United States—support that agreement in a way that can be ratified by both sides. And we have invested a lot of time. Vice President Biden has been actively involved in this. We are encouraged by the progress that's been made. I think there's a window in the next few weeks, months, where this issue was actually resolved. And I think if we can find an equitable solution, it won't provide a hundred percent of what either side wants, there may be some mechanisms for a transition from the status quo to the future that both sides envision, but I think it's achievable. And we're going to do everything we can to support the process.\nWith respect to the economy and Europe, again, I think it's important to recognize that in some ways my job was simpler because, at least in the first 2 years, I had majorities of my party controlling Congress. And I'm just one country. [Laughter] So Congress is hard to deal with. [Laughter] Dealing with multiple Parliaments and commissions and unions and this and that and the other and—that's very complicated. And so the need, I think, to operate by consensus, the fact that not all European countries were similarly situated, even though their economy shared a currency, that made their task more difficult. And so I want to make sure that I'm clear that I don't envy the hard job that each European leader had in circumstances that oftentimes they had inherited.\nWhat I've tried to do is just offer our best thinking, whether it's in resolving problems in banks quickly—because the quicker you resolve the problems with banks and there's transparency in that process, the faster they recapitalize and are able to make investments. When the economy is shrinking, providing jobs, spending on things like infrastructure can actually increase revenue and drive down debt. And then, there's going to be a time at which point that has to be taken care of.\nI mean, for example, in the United States, our deficits went up in those first 2 years because we were engaging in a lot of emergency spending. Our deficits have now been reduced by two-thirds, primarily because we started growing again, and we started taking in more tax revenue.\nSo there's some lessons, I think, that are applicable for all countries. And what we've just tried to do is offer the best advice that we can, understanding that when you're dealing with multiple nations, but a single currency, and then a European Union, where some people are in the currency and some people are not in the currency, and a European Parliament and European Council and—that's a lot of meetings. [Laughter] Okay?\nPrime Minister Tsipras. I will fully agree with what President Obama has just said in answering the question about Cyprus. It is not a bilateral issue. It is not a problem between Greece and Turkey. It's an international problem, which has been going on for 42 years—as long as I'm alive—and it is a problem of illegal invasion and occupation of the northern part of Cyprus. We make our best, we do our best in—to encourage both sides to help them reach a fair and equitable and sustainable solution.\nIn my first visit to Cyprus as a Prime Minister, I tried and I did meet over and above the leaders of the Republic of Cyprus, a number of representatives of the Turkish Cypriot community. And I think that that was the first time that a Greek Prime Minister was meeting with them. We are interested in making sure that the people of Cyprus will be able to live in a reunited Cyprus where they are free, where there's a democracy, freedom, and Cyprus is a member of the European Union.\nSo I would like to make it clear that as regards Greece, we are in favor of a solution. We stand by the side of President Anastasiadis, who is making the effort, and we are only ready to discuss with Turkey the part which is relevant to us; that is the guarantees. Because since 1959, since 1960, this obsolete issue of guarantees also concerns Greece. But Greece is not the country which has occupied and illegally—invaded and illegally occupied Cyprus.\nSo I believe that a fair and sustainable solution means a solution without the permanent presence of Turkish troops on the island. And at the same time, I think that the best guarantee for the Cypriot people to feel safe is the potential of a fair and sustainable solution. And if this happens, things will change not only for Cyprus, but for the wider region, in general and for Greek-Turkish relations. This is how we are proceeding.\nI believe that, yes, President Erdogan plays an important role, but it is not my responsibility to convince him, Mr. Ignoti.\nMr. Earnest. The final question will come from Chris Jansing with NBC News.\n2016 Presidential Election/The President's World View\nQ. Thank you. Mr. President, ever since the election there have been protests on the streets of the United States. And earlier this year, Matt Lauer asked you if you believed you helped create the environment for Donald Trump to run. And you answered, talk to me if he wins about how responsible I feel about it. I wonder, do you feel any responsibility for the election of Donald Trump? And in the broader context, when you see his election, when you look at politicians like Theresa May, Marine Le Pen, do you believe that it is either a movement away from or an outright rejection of your world view?\nAnd, Mr. Prime Minister, you've also talked about your concerns about the rise of the extreme right in general. And about Donald Trump, in particular, you said, I hope we will not face this evil. Do you believe Donald Trump or his ideas are still evil? And if so, do you believe your comments and the comments of other European leaders will make it more difficult for you to work with him? Thank you.\nPresident Obama. Well, first of all, I think it's fair to say that I was surprised by the election results, and I've said so. I still don't feel responsible for what the President-elect says or does. But I do feel a responsibility as President of the United States to make sure that I facilitate a good transition and I present to him as well as the American people my best thinking, my best ideas about how you move the country forward, to speak out with respect to areas where I think the Republican Party is wrong, but to pledge to work with them on those things that I think will advance the causes of security and prosperity and justice and inclusiveness in America.\nI think it's important not to start drawing parallels, for example, between Theresa May, a fairly traditional conservative politician, who is now Prime Minister, and Le Pen in France. Those aren't the same, and the situation in each country is different.\nI do think, as I've said before, that history doesn't move in a straight line. It zigs and zags and sometimes goes forward and sometimes moves back, sideways. I think at times of significant stress, people are going to be looking for something—and they don't always know exactly what it is that they're looking for—and they may opt for change even if they're not entirely confident what that change will bring.\nAs you know, throughout my Presidency—I'm sure as a matter of convenience—I generally haven't paid a lot of attention to the polls. But since your question is directly related to the notion of a rejection of my world view, last I checked, a pretty healthy majority of the American people agree with my world view on a whole bunch of things. And I know that that begs the question, well, how is it that somebody who appears to have a very different world view just got elected? As I said, sometimes, people just feel as if we want to try something to see if we can shake things up. And that, I suspect, was a significant phenomenon.\nI do believe, separate and apart from any particular election or movement, that we are going to have to guard against a rise in a crude sort of nationalism or ethnic identity or tribalism that is built around an \"us\" and a \"them.\" And I will never apologize for saying that the future of humanity and the future of the world is going to be defined by what we have in common as opposed to those things that separate us and ultimately lead us into conflict.\nTake Europe. We know what happens when Europeans start dividing themselves up and emphasizing their differences and seeing a competition between various countries in a zero-sum way. The 20th century was a bloodbath. And for all the frustrations and failures of the project to unify Europe, the last five decades have been periods of unprecedented peace, growth, and prosperity in Europe.\nIn the United States, we know what happens when we start dividing ourselves along lines of race or religion or ethnicity. It's dangerous. Not just for the minority groups that are subjected to that kind of discrimination or, in some cases in the past, violence, but because we then don't realize our potential as a country when we're preventing Blacks or Latinos or Asians or gays or women from fully participating in the project of building American life.\nSo my vision is right on that issue. And it may not always win the day in the short term in any particular political circumstance, but I'm confident it will win the day over the long term. Because societies in which we are able to unify ourselves around values and ideals and character and how we treat each other and cooperation and innovation ultimately are going to be more successful than societies that don't.\nThat's my strong belief. And I think I've got pretty good evidence to prove it.\nPrime Minister Tsipras. To be honest, I know very little of Donald Trump. I got to know his aggressive manner and the manner in which he defended some unconventional points of view during the election period. Some have told me that I should have read his book before going to bargain in Brussels, \"The Art of the Deal.\" I didn't. But I don't think that that was decisive to the result.\nStill, let me point out that it was one thing what we knew about Donald Trump when he was seeking to become the candidate for the Republican Party; another thing during the election period; and now that he is the President-elect; and it's quite another when he will be the President of a country that is a major player, a global player.\nSo that is why, contrary to some of my colleagues in Europe, I did not rush to repeat some of the criticisms that many of us have made during the election period about Donald Trump. I also believe that if someone would want to rapidly change the foreign policy of a country such as the United States—which is very difficult—and although some of us in Europe may fear that this may happen, what we should be doing is build bridges, not walls. We are proceeding on the basis of common values. We have more to gain from partnership, from promoting our partnership in dealing with the big global challenges.\nI therefore believe in the near future, not much is going to change in the relations between EU, Greece, and the United States of America. These are relations that were forged under very difficult conditions and rely on the common values of our people.\nPresident Obama. Thank you, my friend.", "timestamp": "2016-11-15", "title": "The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Alexios Tsipras of Greece in Athens, Greece"}

In his remarks, he referred to Prime Minister Alexios Tsipras of Greece; and Michael F. Phelps II, swimmer, 2016 U.S. Olympic team. President Pavlopoulos referred to Mark A. Mazower, Ira D. Wallach Professor of History, Columbia University. President Pavlopoulos spoke in Greek, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119706", "text": "President Pavlopoulos. Mr. President, I welcome you to Athens and to the Presidency of the Republic, as the President of the United States of America, who has constantly and consistently served with respect for man, for the consolidation of peace and the defense of democracy, and of its twin brother, the social rule of law, by holding in check the extreme inequalities which directly threaten social cohesion. We fully share those ideals.\nLet me be even more specific. In this deep and prolonged economic and social crisis, which is plaguing our country and our people, for which we are far from being the only ones to blame, I would like to point out the following three things.\nFirst, we deeply believe in representative democracy and in every one of its institutional dimensions. We are especially inspired by your emblematic constitutional tradition of checks and balances. It is these that shield popular sovereignty and parliamentary rule, as well as the independence of justice from many arbitrary interference by the executive or, even more, by the various instruments of globalization which lack any democratic legitimacy.\nSecond, we continue our unwavering course within the European Union, and its hard core, the euro zone, despite the huge economic and social burden of a mostly wrong and dead end austerity policy. And in respect of this, Mr. President, I'm very happy to hear—I was very happy to hear you point this out, and I hope that your words will urge our European partners to move in the right direction.\nAlongside our partners, with which we share the true and selfless European path, we fight to restore the values and principles which were the foundations of European integration, mainly the respect of—for man and for social justice. These are the principles which will keep the nightmare of fascism and Nazism left behind by World War II forever in the dismal past. We never forget the decisive contribution of the United States of America in that war so that Europe could hold back the fate of what Mark Mazower called the \"Dark Continent.\" We will always remember Omaha Beach in Normandy.\nThird, Mr. President, we are responding with uncompromising dignity to the huge refugee crisis, which you have called of epic dimension, which is mainly the result of the war in Syria. We expect solidarity by our European partners, and we expect that they will open up their minds and listen to your opinion. In this, we are inspired by the ancient Greek institution of the supplement. At the same time, we are doing our part in the fight against the barbarism of jihadism, which is committing crimes against humanity.\nBut, Mr. President, in order to defend refugees and to stop terrorism, the war in Syria and in the wider region must end. This is the common objective, and this requires harmonious cooperation of the U.S., the EU, and Russia. And we're happy that you were able to fully understand this truth and have turned it into action with your wise and also visionary policy, and therefore, we start seeing the first results. Maybe late, but it is never too late.\nMr. President, we urge you from here, from Athens, with its eternal symbol of Parthenon—the Parthenon of democracy and civilization—to continue to serve the same ideals after the end of your term. Your appeal will continue into the future. In this future and very promising journey, we would like you to take Greece along. And at this point, I'd like to remember the words of the poet Odysseas Elytis: Please do not forget our country.\nI will, therefore, conclude by—my address by reminding you of what André Malraux said in his memorable speech at the inauguration of the illumination of the Acropolis on 29th of—March 29, 1958: \"A secret Greece resides in the heart of all men of the West.\" It is this secret Greece that the Greek people offer you as a gift during this visit, precisely because we deem it worthy of the U.S. President, Barack Obama.\nMr. President, on behalf of the Greek people, I wish you personal health and success. And I ask you to convey the Greek people's sincere warm wishes for growth and prosperity to our committed and great friends, the American people.\nOnce again, welcome, Mr. President.\nPresident Obama. Kalispera. [Laughter] Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen: Once again, it is a great honor to be in Greece. And on behalf of myself and my delegation, on behalf of the American people, thank you for the warmth that you've shown us on this visit.\nOf course, your hospitality comes as no surprise. As Pericles said in his famous oration many centuries ago: \"In nobility of spirit, we differ from most others in the way we conduct ourselves towards other people. We make friendships not by receiving kindness from others, but by conferring it on others.\" And we certainly have felt the kindness of the Greek people conferred on us today.\nI'll have more to say in my speech tomorrow about the ties of history and heritage that bind our peoples together. Of course, that does include our love of the Olympics. Greeks rightly take pride as the founder of the Games and in Leonidas of Rhodes who, for 2,000 years, held the record for winning 12 individual gold medals, the most of any athlete. And we Americans take pride in Michael Phelps, who set the new record this summer.\nBesides that friendly competition, we are deeply grateful for our alliance with the Greek people. I think that we have inspired each other to reach for independence, stood in solidarity during war and peace, in good times and in bad, including these very difficult years for the Greek people. And tonight I want you to know that as you work to move your country forward, you will always have the support and friendship of the United States.\nI want to close with a moment from our shared history. In 1821, as Greece began its fight for independence, a Greek patriot wrote a letter to the American Government appealing for assistance. \"Although a broad sea separates us,\" he wrote, \"your virtues, Americans, are close to ours.\" And he added, \"We consider you as friends, copatriots and brothers.\"\nSo——\n[At this point, the interpreter began translating President Obama's remarks.]\nPlease.\n[The interpreter continued.]\nSo, in appreciation for our friendship and your hospitality, if I might propose a toast: To the virtues and values that unite us across a broad sea. May Greeks and Americans always be there for each other: as friends, as copatriots, and brothers and sisters. Stin ygeia sas. [Laughter] Cheers.

The Council will provide a lasting structure for Federal agencies to strengthen partnerships with communities and improve coordination across the Federal Government in order to more efficiently deliver assistance and maximize impact.\nAcross the country, citizens and local leaders need a Federal Government that is more effective, responsive, and collaborative in addressing their needs and challenges. Far too often, the Federal Government has taken a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach to working with communities and left local leaders on their own to find Federal resources and navigate disparate programs. Responding to the call for change from local officials and leaders nationwide, and grounded in the belief that the best solutions come from the bottom up, not from the top down, Federal agencies have increasingly taken on a different approach to working with communities to deliver better outcomes in more than 1,800 cities, towns, regions, and tribal communities nationwide.\nAs a part of this new way of working, Federal agencies are partnering with local officials to support local plans and visions. They are crossing agency and program silos to support cities, towns, counties and tribes in implementing locally-developed plans for improvement – from re-lighting city streets to breathing new life into half-empty rural main streets. And by using data to measure success and harnessing technology, Federal agencies are focusing on community-driven solutions and what works, while monitoring progress to make investments that have a strong base of evidence behind them.\nBuilding on this success, the President today signed an Executive Order (EO) that will continue to make government work better for the American people. The EO establishes a Council for Community Solutions to streamline and improve the way the Federal Government works with cities, counties, and communities – rural, tribal, urban and sub-urban – to improve outcomes. The Council includes leadership from agencies, departments and offices across the Federal Government and the White House, who together will develop and implement policy that puts local priorities first, highlights successful solutions based on best practices, and streamlines Federal support for communities. Further, the Council, where appropriate, will engage with representatives and leaders of organizations, businesses and communities to expand and improve partnerships that address the most pressing challenges communities face.\nThis Administration has been dedicated to leaving the Federal Government better and more effective than we found it. This Executive Order is just one part of accomplishing that goal and, as the work of government continues, will equip new leadership with an important tool as they undertake new policies and initiatives.\nLocal Partners Driving Progress\nLocal leaders are tackling the country's toughest challenges and a more effective, responsive, and collaborative Federal Government has led to improved infrastructure, revitalized neighborhoods, and increased economic opportunities for their communities. Here, they highlight some of the benefits of a strong Federal-local partnership:\n•      Fresno, CA: \"Having Federal partners working with you, rooting for you, helping to remove obstacles instead of being the obstacles themselves, completely reinvigorates you as a community and helps you really know that you can in fact move forward.\" – Mayor Ashley Swearengin\n•      Rockford, IL: \"[Strong Cities, Strong Communities] gave us a much more personal relationship between the city and...the federal government...Lynnette [Strong Cities, Strong Communities Team Leader] is an example of what this President was willing to do to humanize our work with the federal government.\" -- Mayor Larry Morrissey\n•      Choctaw Nation in Oklahoma: \"I am very thankful that the Choctaw Nation and partners have been awarded the Promise Zone designation....this designation will assist with ongoing efforts to emphasize small business development and bring economic opportunity to...high-need communities. I am confident that access to the technical assistance and resources offered by the Promise Zones designation will result in better lifestyles for people living and working within the Choctaw Nation\" -- Choctaw Chief Gregory E. Pyle\n•      Gary, IN: \"In addition to putting out fires, we've had the luxury of long-term planning with the Feds coming in to work side by side with us each day [through Strong Cities, Strong Communities]. So often as city leaders, we think about how to get money from the Federal Government. But what I've come to understand is that the technical assistance and ability to work across agency lines has been priceless to the City of Gary.\" - Mayor Karen Freeman-Wilson\n•      Atlanta, GA: \"The City of Atlanta is honored to participate in the TechHire Initiative. In partnership with community leaders and business partners, we will provide residents with the accelerated, technical training needed to obtain better jobs and achieve brighter futures. The Atlanta TechHire Initiative will be essential to ensuring that our residents have the skills needed to compete in the global economy.\" – Mayor Kasim Reed\nBuilding on Efforts to Further Federal Partnership with Cities, Counties, and Communities\nToday's Executive Order builds on the last seven years of work done by Federal leaders—many working behind the scenes--and the successful efforts of the Community Solutions Task Force (Task Force) launched in 2015. The Task Force worked to solidify progress made beginning with budget guidance issued in February 2009 to develop a customized Federal approach to working with cities and towns. The Federal programs launched since then—from Strong Cities, Strong Communities to the Partnership for Sustainable Communities and beyond— have revealed ways the Federal Government can work better with local places to drive desired outcomes.\nThis progress is further fueled by efforts such as:\n•      Optimizing Federal Investments: The Federal government has used data and administrative tools to drive Federal investments to communities where they can make the biggest impact. Recognizing that their loans and grants could be more strategically used for highest-need areas, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development empowered staff with simple outreach tools and accountability measures to increase investments in persistent-poverty communities. In just three years, the share of targeted USDA investments directed to high poverty areas has increased by $2.5 billion – at no additional cost to its programs overall.\n•      Harnessing Data and Technology to Improve Outcomes for Communities: The Federal government is working to foster collaborations between communities and the tech sector, non-profits and citizens to help communities develop new ways to use both Federal and local data to address challenges with greater precision and innovation. As a result, new digital tools are helping citizens find affordable housing near jobs and transportation, matching unemployed Americans with jobs that meet their skills, enabling local leaders to use data to better target investments, and more.\n•      Streamlining Federal Engagement: Federal teams are working intensively in over 20 high-need cities, regions and tribal nations around the country. These teams align resources from across the Federal government and work behind the scenes to build local talent and capacity so that communities like Detroit and Baltimore can emerge from crisis. The Johns Hopkins University 21st Century Cities Initiative published a Federal-Local Partnerships Playbook, drawing on the experience of Federal teams in these communities.", "timestamp": "2016-11-16", "title": "Fact Sheet: Establishing a Council on Community Solutions to Align Federal Efforts with Local Priorities and Citizens' Needs"}

Thank you very much. Thank you. Please, please have a seat. Thank you.\nAudience member. Chicago!\nThe President. Chicago, yes. [Laughter]\nHello, Greece! Thank you. Yia sas! Kalispera! [Laughter] To the Government and the people of Greece—including Prime Minister Tsipras, who I thank for his partnership and for being here—along with so many young people, the future of Greece: I want to thank you for your warm and generous welcome.\nAs many of you know, this is my final trip overseas as President of the United States, and I was determined on my last trip to come to Greece partly because I've heard about the legendary hospitality of the Greek people, your philoxenia. [Laughter] Partly because I had to see the Acropolis and the Parthenon. But also because I came here with gratitude for all that Greece—\"this small, great world\"—has given to humanity through the ages.\nOur hearts have been moved by the tragedies of Aeschylus and Euripides. Our minds have been opened by the histories of Herodotus and Thucydides. Our understanding of the world and our place in it has been expanded by Socrates and Aristotle.\nIn the United States, we're especially grateful for the friendship of so many proud Greek Americans. In my hometown of Chicago, you can find them in Greektown—[laughter]—with their foustanellas. [Laughter] And together, we've celebrated Greek Independence Day at the White House. We've had some spanakopita and some ouzo. [Laughter] Greek Americans have worn the uniform to keep our country free. Greek Americans have marched with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., to make us more just. Greek or American, we're all cheering for Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is—[laughter]—who seems to be getting better each year. [Laughter] And if anyone seeks an example of our shared spirit, our resilience, they need look no further than New York City near Ground Zero where the Greek Orthodox church of St. Nicholas, once in ruins, is now rising again.\nMost of all, we're indebted to Greece for the most precious of gifts: the truth—the understanding—that as individuals of free will, we have the right and the capacity to govern ourselves. For it was here, 25 centuries ago, in the rocky hills of this city, that a new idea emerged: demokratia. Kratos—[applause].\nKratos—the power, the right to rule—comes from demos, the people; the notion that we are citizens, not servants, but stewards of our society; the concept of citizenship: that we have both rights and responsibilities; the belief in equality before the law, not just for a few, but for the many; not just for the majority, but also the minority. These are all concepts that grew out of this rocky soil.\nOf course, the earliest forms of democracy here in Athens were far from perfect, just as the early forms of democracy in the United States were far from perfect. The rights of ancient Athens were not extended to women or to slaves. But Pericles explained, \"Our constitution . . . favors the many instead of the few; this is why it is called a democracy.\" Athenians also knew that, however noble, ideas alone were not enough. To have meaning, principles must be enshrined in laws and protected by institutions, and advanced through civic participation. And so they gathered in a great assembly to debate and decide affairs of state, each citizen with the right to speak, casting their vote with a show of hands or choosing a pebble: white for yes, black for no. Laws were etched in stone for all to see and abide by. Courts with citizen jurors upheld that rule of law.\nPoliticians weren't always happy because sometimes the stones could be used to ostracize—[laughter]—banish those who did not behave themselves.\nBut across the millennia that followed, different views of power and governance have often prevailed. Throughout human history, there have been those who argue that people cannot handle democracy, that they cannot handle self-determination, they need to be told what to do; a ruler has to maintain order through violence or coercion or an iron fist. There's been a different concept of government that says might makes right or that unchecked power can be passed through bloodlines. There's been the belief that some are superior by virtue of race or faith or ethnicity, and those beliefs so often have been used to justify conquest and exploitation and war.\nBut through all this history, the flame first lit here in Athens never died. It was ultimately nurtured by a great Enlightenment. It was fanned by America's Founders who declared that \"We, the People, shall rule; that all men are created equal and endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights.\"\nNow, at times, even today, those ideals are challenged. We've been told that these are Western ideas. We've been told that some cultures are not equipped for democratic governance and actually prefer authoritarian rule. And I will say that after 8 years of being President of the United States, having traveled around the globe, it is absolutely true that every country travels its own path; every country has its own traditions. But what I also believe, after 8 years, is that the basic longing to live with dignity, the fundamental desire to have control of our lives and our future and to want to be a part of determining the course of our communities and our nations—these yearnings are universal. They burn in every human heart.\nIt's why a Greek bishop atop a mountain raised the flag of independence. It's why peoples from the Americas to Africa to Asia threw off the yoke of colonialism. It's why people behind an Iron Curtain marched in solidarity and tore down that wall and joined you in a great union of democracies. It's why, today, we support the right of Ukrainians to choose their own destiny; why we partner with Tunisians and the people of Myanmar as they make historic transitions to democracy.\nThis has been my foreign policy during my Presidency. By necessity, we work with all countries, and many of them are not democracies. Some of them are democracies in the sense they have elections, but not democracies in the sense of actually permitting participation and dissent. But our trajectory as a country has been to support the efforts of those who believe in self-governance, who believe in those ideas that began here so many years ago.\nAnd it is not simply a matter of us being true to our values. It's not just a matter of idealism. I believe it is practical for the United States to support democracies, because history shows us that countries with democratic governance tend to be more just and more stable and more successful.\nOpen, democratic societies can deliver more prosperity, because when people are free to think for themselves and share ideas and discover and create—the young people who are here, what they're able to do through the Internet and technology—that's when innovation is unleashed, when economies truly flourish. That's when new products and new services and new ideas wash through an economy. In contrast to regimes that rule by coercion, democracies are rooted in consent of the governed. Citizens know that there's a path for peaceful change, including the moral force of nonviolence. And that brings a stability that so often can facilitate economic growth.\nThe history of the past two centuries indicates that democracies are less likely to fight wars among themselves. So more democracy is good for the people of the world, but it's also good for our national security, which is why America's closest friends are democracies like Greece. It's why we stand together in NATO, an alliance of democracies.\nIn recent years, we've made historic investments in NATO, increased America's presence in Europe, and today's NATO—the world's greatest alliance—is as strong and as ready as it's ever been. And I am confident that just as America's commitment to the transatlantic alliance has endured for seven decades—whether it's been under a Democratic or Republican administration—that commitment will continue, including our pledge and our treaty obligation to defend every ally.\nOur democracies show that we're stronger than terrorists and fundamentalists and absolutists, who can't tolerate difference, can't tolerate ideas that vary from their own, who try to change people's way of life through violence and would make us betray or shrink from our values. Democracy is stronger than organizations like ISIL.\nBecause our democracies are inclusive, we're able to welcome people and refugees in need to our countries. And nowhere have we seen that compassion more evident than here in Greece. The Greek people's generosity towards refugees arriving on your shores has inspired the world. That doesn't mean that you should be left on your own, and a—only a truly collective response by Europe and the world can ensure that these desperate people receive the support that they need. Greece cannot be expected to bear the bulk of the burden alone, but the fact that you are a democracy opens your heart to people in need in a way that might not otherwise be the case.\nJust as democracies are premised on the peaceful resolution of disagreements within our societies, we also believe that cooperation and dialogue is the best way to address challenges between nations. And so it is my belief that democracies are more likely to try to resolve conflicts between nations in a way that does not result in war. That's how, with diplomacy, we were able to shut down Iran's nuclear weapons program without firing a shot. With diplomacy, the United States opened relations with Cuba. With diplomacy, we joined Greece and nearly 200 nations in the most ambitious agreement ever to save our planet from climate change.\nAnd speaking of climate change, I would point out that there is a connection between democracy and science. The premise of science is that we observe and we test our hypotheses, our ideas. We base decisions on facts, not superstition, not what our ideology tells us, but rather, what we can observe. And at a time when the globe is shrinking and more and more we're going to have to take collective action to deal with problems like climate change, the presence of a democratic debate allows the science to flourish and to shape our collective responses.\nNow, democracy, like all human institutions, is imperfect. It can be slow. It can be frustrating. It can be hard. It can be messy. Politicians tend to be unpopular in democracies, regardless of party, because, by definition, democracies require that you don't get a hundred percent of what you want. It requires compromise. Winston Churchill famously said that democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others. [Laughter] And in a multiethnic, multiracial, multicultural society, like the United States, democracy can be especially complicated. Believe me, I know. [Laughter]\nBut it is better than the alternatives because it allows us to peacefully work through our differences and move closer to our ideals. It allows us to test new ideas, and it allows us to correct for mistakes. Any action by a President or any result of an election or any legislation that has proven flawed can be corrected through the process of democracy.\nAnd throughout our history, it's how we have come to see that all people are created equal, even though, when we were founded, that was not the case. We could work to expand the rights that were established in our founding to African Americans and to women, to Americans with disabilities, to Native Americans—why all Americans now have the freedom to marry the person they love. It's why we've welcomed people of all races and all religions and all backgrounds and immigrants, who strive to give their children a better life and who make our country stronger.\nAnd so here, where democracy was born, we affirm once more the rights and the ideals and the institutions upon which our way of life endures: freedom of speech and assembly because true legitimacy can only come from the people, who must never be silenced; a free press to expose injustice and corruption and hold leaders accountable; freedom of religion because we are all equal in the eyes of God; independent judiciaries to uphold rule of law and human rights; separation of powers to limit the reach of any one branch of government; free and fair elections because citizens must be able to choose their own leaders, even if your candidate doesn't always win. [Laughter]\nWe compete hard in campaigns in America and here in Greece. But after the election, democracy depends on a peaceful transition of power, especially when you don't get the results you want.\nAnd as may—you may have noticed, the next American President and I could not be more different. [Laughter] We have very different points of view, but American democracy is bigger than any one person. And that's why we have a tradition of the outgoing President welcoming the new one in, as I did last week, and why, in the coming weeks, my administration will do everything we can to support the smoothest transition possible, because that's how democracy has to work.\nAnd that's why, as hard as it can be sometimes, it's important for young people, in particular, who are just now becoming involved in the lives of their countries, to understand that progress follows a winding path—sometimes forward, sometimes back—but as long as we retain our faith in democracy, as long as we retain our faith in the people, as long as we don't waver from those central principles that ensure a lively, open debate, then our future will be okay, because it remains the most effective form of government ever devised by man.\nIt is true, of course, over the last several years that we've seen democracies faced with serious challenges. And I want to mention two that have an impact here in Greece, have an impact in the United States, and are having an impact around the world.\nThe first involves the paradox of a modern global economy. The same forces of globalization and technology and integration that have delivered so much progress, have created so much wealth, have also revealed deep fault lines. Around the world, integration and closer cooperation and greater trade and commerce and the Internet all have improved the lives of billions of people, lifted families from extreme poverty, cured diseases, helped people live longer, gave them more access to education and opportunity than at any time in human history.\nI've often said to young people in the United States, if you had to choose a moment in history to be born and you did not know ahead of time who you would be—you didn't know whether you were going to be born into a wealthy family or a poor family, what country you'd be born, whether you were going to be a man or a woman—if you had to choose blindly what moment you'd want to be born, you'd choose now. Because the world has never, collectively, been wealthier, better educated, healthier, less violent than it is today. That's hard to imagine, given what we see in the news, but it's true. And a lot of that has to do with the developments of a integrated, global economy.\nBut trends underway for decades have meant that in many countries and in many communities there have been enormous disruptions. Technology and automation means that goods can be produced with fewer workers. It means jobs and manufacturing can move across borders where wages are lower or rights are less protected. And that means that workers and unions oftentimes have less leverage to bargain for better wages, better benefits, have more difficulty competing in the global marketplace. Hard-working families worry their kids may not be better off than they were because of this global competition.\nWhat we've also seen is that this global integration is increasing the tendencies towards inequality, both between nations and within nations, at an accelerated pace. And when we see people—global elites, wealthy corporations—seemingly living by a different set of rules, avoiding taxes, manipulating loopholes; when the rich and the powerful appear to game the system and accumulate vast wealth while middle and working class families struggle to make ends meet—this feeds a profound sense of injustice and a feeling that our economies are increasingly unfair.\nAnd this inequality now constitutes one of the greatest challenges to our economies and to our democracies. An inequality that was once tolerated because people didn't know how unequal things were now won't be tolerated because everybody has a cell phone and can see how unequal things are. The awareness that people have in the smallest African village, they can see how people in London or New York are living. The poorest child in any of our countries now has a sense of what other people have that they don't. So not only is there increasing inequality, but also there is greater awareness of inequality. And that's a volatile mix for our democracies.\nAnd this is why addressing inequality has been one of the key areas of focus for my economic policy. In our countries, in America and in most advanced market economies, we want people to be rewarded for their achievement. We think that people should be rewarded if they come up with a new product or a new service that is popular and helps a lot of people. But when a CEO of a company now makes more money in a single day than a typical worker does in an entire year, when it's harder for workers to climb their way up the economic ladder, when they see a factory close that used to support an entire city or town, that fuels the feeling that globalization only benefits those at the top. And the reaction can drag down a country's growth and make recessions more likely. It can also lead to politics that create an unhealthy competition between countries. Rather than a win-win situation, people perceive that if you're winning, I'm losing, and barriers come up and walls come up.\nAnd in advanced economies, there are at times movements from both the left and the right to put a stop to integration and to push back against technology and to try to bring back jobs and industries that have been disappearing for decades. So this impulse to pull back from a globalized world is understandable. If people feel that they're losing control of their future, they will push back. We have seen it here in Greece. We've seen it across Europe. We've seen it in the United States. We saw it in the vote in Britain to leave the EU.\nBut given the nature of technology, it is my assertion that it's not possible to cut ourselves off from one another. We now are living in a global supply chain. Our growth comes through innovation and ideas that are crossing borders all the time. The jobs of tomorrow will inevitably be different from the jobs of the past. So we can't look backwards for answers, we have to look forward.\nWe cannot sever the connections that have enabled so much progress and so much wealth. For when competition for resources is perceived as zero sum, we put ourselves on a path to conflict both within countries and between countries. So I firmly believe that the best hope for human progress remains open markets, combined with democracy and human rights. But I have argued that the current path of globalization demands a course correction. In the years and decades ahead, our countries have to make sure that the benefits of an integrated global economy are more broadly shared by more people and that the negative impacts are squarely addressed.\nAnd we know—[applause]—and we actually know the path to building more inclusive economies. It's just we too often don't have the political will or desire to get it done. We know we need bold policies that spur growth and support jobs. We know that we need to give workers more leverage and better wages, and that, in fact, if you give workers better wages, businesses do better too because their customers now have money to spend.\nWe know that we have to invest more in our people: the education of our young people, the skills and training to compete in the global economy. We have to make sure that it is easy for young people who are eager to learn and eager to work to get the education that they need, the training that they need, without taking on huge amounts of debt.\nWe know that we have to encourage entrepreneurship so that it's easier to start a business and do business. We know that we have to strengthen the social compact so that the safety net that is available for people, including quality health care and retirement benefits are there even if people aren't working in the same job for 30 years or 40 years or 50 years.\nWe have to modernize our infrastructure, which will put people back to work. We have to commit to the science and research and development that sparks new industries.\nIn our trading relationships, we have to make sure that trade works for us and not against us. And that means insisting on high standards in all countries to support jobs, strong protections for workers, strong protections for the environment so that even as we freely trade, people and workers in all countries see the benefits of trade in their own lives, not just benefits for the bottom line of large, multinational corporations.\nThese are the kinds of policies, this is the work that I've pursued throughout my time as President. Keep in mind I took office in the midst of the worst crisis since the Great Depression. And we pursued a recovery that has been shared now by the vast majority of Americans. We put people back to work building bridges and roads. We passed tax cuts for the middle class. We asked the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more taxes, their fair share. We intervened to save our auto industry, but insisted that the auto industry become more energy efficient, produce better cars that reduce pollution. We put in place policies to help students with loans and protect consumers from fraud. We passed the strongest Wall Street reforms in history so that the excesses and abuses that triggered the global financial crisis never happen again or at least don't start on Wall Street.\nAnd today, our businesses have created more than 15 million new jobs. Incomes last year in America rose faster than any time since 1968. Poverty fell at the fastest rate since 1968. Inequality is being narrowed. And we've also begun to close the pay gap between men and women.\nWe declared that health care in America is a privilege not for the few, but a right for everybody. Today, our uninsured rate is at the lowest levels on record. And we've done all this while doubling our production of clean energy, lowering our carbon pollution faster than any advanced nation. So we've proven that you can grow the economy and reduce the carbon emissions that cause climate change at the same time.\nNow, I say all this not because we've solved every problem. Our work is far from complete. There are still too many people in America who are worried about their futures, still too many people who are working at wages that don't get them above the poverty line, still too many young people who don't see opportunity. But the policies I describe point the direction for where we need to go in building inclusive economies. And that's how democracies can deliver the prosperity and hope that our people need. And when people have opportunity and they feel confidence in the future, they are less likely to turn on each other, and they're less likely to appeal to some of the darker forces that exist in all our societies, those that can tear us apart.\nHere in Greece, you're undergoing similar transformations. The first step has been to build a foundation that allows you to return to robust economic growth. And we don't need to recount all the causes of the economic crisis here in Greece. If we're honest, we can acknowledge that it was a mix of both internal and external forces. The Greek economy and the levels of debt had become unsustainable. And in this global economy, investment and jobs flow to countries where governments are efficient, not bloated, where the rules are clear. To stay competitive, to attract investment that creates jobs, Greece had to start a reform process.\nOf course, the world, I don't think, fully appreciates the extraordinary pain these reforms have involved or the tremendous sacrifices that you, the Greek people, have made. I've been aware of it, and I've been proud of all that my administration has done to try to support Greece in these efforts. And part of the purpose of my visit is to highlight for the world the important steps that have been taken here in Greece.\nToday, the budget is back in surplus. Parliament passed reforms to make the economy more competitive. Yes, there is still much more work to do. I want to commend Prime Minister Tsipras for the very difficult reforms his government is pursuing to put the economy on a firmer footing. Now, as Greece works to attract more investment and to prevent old imbalances from reemerging and to put your economy on a stronger foundation, you'll continue to have the full support of the United States.\nAnd at the same time, I will continue to urge creditors to take the steps needed to put Greece on a path towards sustained economic recovery. So as Greece continues to implement reforms, the IMF has said that debt relief will be crucial to get Greece back to growth. They are right. It is important because if reforms here are going to be sustained, people need to see hope, and they need to see progress. And the young people who are in attendance here today and all across the country need to know there is a future; there is an education and jobs that are worthy of your incredible potential. You don't have to travel overseas. You can put roots right here in your home, in Greece, and succeed.\nAnd I'm confident that if you stay the course, as hard as it has been, Greece will see brighter days. Because in this magnificent hall and center, this symbol of the Greek culture and resilience, we're reminded that just as your strength and resolve have allowed you to overcome great odds throughout your history, nothing can break the spirit of the Greek people. You will overcome this period of challenge just as you have other challenges in the past.\nSo economics is something that will be central to preserving our democracies. When our economies don't work, our democracies become distorted and, in some cases, break down. But this brings me to another pressing challenge that our democracies face: How do we ensure that our diverse, multicultural, multiracial, multireligious world and our diverse nations uphold both the rights of individuals and a fundamental civic adherence to a common creed that binds us together?\nDemocracy is simplest where everybody thinks alike, looks alike, eats the same food, worships the same God. Democracy becomes more difficult when there are people coming from a variety of backgrounds and trying to live together. In our globalized world, with the migration of people and the rapid movement of ideas and cultures and traditions, we see increasingly this blend of forces mixing together in ways that often enrich our societies, but also cause tensions.\nIn the Information Age, the unprecedented exchange of information can also accentuate differences or seem to threaten cherished ways of life. It used to be that you might not know how people in another part of your country or in the cities versus the countryside were living. Now, everybody knows how everybody is living, and everybody can feel threatened sometimes if people don't do things exactly the way they do things. And they start asking themselves questions about their own identity. And it can create a volatile politics.\nFaced with this new reality where cultures clash, it's inevitable that some will seek a comfort in nationalism or tribe or ethnicity or sect. In countries that are held together by borders that were drawn by colonial powers, including many countries in the Middle East and in Africa, it can be tempting to fall back on perceived safety of enclaves and tribal divisions.\nIn a world of widening inequality, there's a growing suspicion or even disdain for elites and institutions that seem remote from the daily lives of ordinary people. What an irony it is, at a time when we can reach out to people in the most remote corners of the planet, so many citizens feel disconnected from their own governments.\nSo just as we have to have an inclusive economic strategy, we have to have an exclusive political and cultural strategy. In all of our capitals, we have to keep making government more open, more efficient, more effective in responding to the daily needs of citizens. Governing institutions—whether in Athens, Brussels, London, Washington—have to be responsive to the concerns of citizens. People have to know that they're being heard.\nHere in Europe, even with today's challenges, I believe that by virtue of the progress it has delivered over the decades—the stability it has provided, the security it's reinforced—that European integration and the European Union remains one of the great political and economic achievements of human history. And today more than ever, the world needs a Europe that is strong and prosperous and democratic. But I think all institutions in Europe have to ask themselves: How can we make sure that people within individual countries feel as if their voices are still being heard, that their identities are being affirmed, that the decisions that are being made that will have a critical impact on their lives are not so remote that they have no ability to impact them?\nWe have to make clear that governments exist to serve the interests of citizens and not the other way around. And so this is why, as President of the United States, I've pursued initiatives like the Open Government Partnership that promotes transparency and accountability so that ordinary people know more about the decisions that affect their lives. That's why both at home and around the world, we have taken steps to fight corruption that can rot a society from within.\nAs authoritarian governments work to close space that citizens depend upon to organize and have their voices heard, we've begun the work of empowering civil society to defend democratic values and promote solutions to the problems within our communities. And as so many people around the world sometimes are tempted by cynicism and not being involved because they think that politicians and government don't care about them, we've created networks for young leaders and invested in young entrepreneurs, because we believe that the hope and renewal of our societies begins with the voices of youth.\nIn closing, our globalized world is passing through a time of profound change. Yes, there is uncertainty and there is unease, and none of us can know the future. History does not move in a straight line. Civil rights in America did not move in a straight line. Democracy in Greece did not move in a straight line. The evolution of a unified Europe certainly has not moved in a straight line. And progress is never guaranteed. Progress has to be earned by every generation. But I believe history gives us hope.\nTwenty-five centuries after Athens first pointed the way, 250 years after the beginning of the great American journey, my faith and my confidence, my certainty in our democratic ideals and universal values remain undiminished. I believe more strongly than ever that Dr. King was right when he said that \"The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.\" But it bends towards justice not because it is inevitable, but because we bend it towards justice. Not because there are not going to be barriers to achieving justice but because there will be people, generation after generation, who have the vision and the courage and the will to bend the arc of our lives in the direction of a better future.\nIn the United States and in every place I've visited these last 8 years, I have met citizens—especially young people—who have chosen hope over fear, who believe that they can shape their own destiny, who refuse to accept the world as it is and are determined to remake it as it should be. They have inspired me.\nIn every corner of the world, I have met people who in their daily lives demonstrate that despite differences of race or religion or creed or color, we have the capacity to see each other in ourselves. Like the woman here in Greece who said of the refugees arriving on these shores: \"We live under the same Sun. We fall in love under the same Moon. We are all human. We have to help these people.\" Women like that give me hope.\nIn all of our communities, in all of our countries, I still believe there's more of what Greeks call philotimo: love and respect and kindness for family and community and country, and a sense that we're all in this together with obligations to each other. Philotimo. I see it every day and that gives me hope. Because in the end, it is up to us. It's not somebody else's job, it's not somebody else's responsibility, but it's the citizens of our countries and the citizens of the world to bend that arc of history towards justice.\nAnd that's what democracy allows us to do. That's why the most important office in any country is not President or Prime Minister. The most important title is citizen. And in all of our nations, it will always be our citizens who decide the kind of countries we will be, the ideals that we will reach for, and the values that will define us. In this great, imperfect, but necessary system of self-government, power and progress will always come from the demos—from we, the people. And I'm confident that as long as we are true to that system of self-government, that our futures will be bright.\nThank you very much.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "note": "This Executive order was published in the  Federal Register  on November 21.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119658", "text": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:\nSection 1. Policy. Place is a strong determinant of opportunity and well-being. Research shows that the neighborhood in which a child grows up impacts his or her odds of going to college, enjoying good health, and obtaining a lifetime of economic opportunities. Even after 73 consecutive months of total job growth since 2009, communities of persistent poverty remain and for far too many, the odds are stacked against opportunity and achieving the American dream. In addition, between now and 2050, growing our economy, expected population growth, climate change, and demographic shifts will require major new investments in physical, social, and technological infrastructure.\nSpecific challenges in communities—including crime, access to care, opportunities to pursue quality education, lack of housing options, unemployment, and deteriorating infrastructure—can be met by leveraging Federal assistance and resources. While the Federal Government provides rural, suburban, urban, and tribal communities with significant investments in aid annually, coordinating these investments, as appropriate, across agencies based on locally led visions can more effectively reach communities of greatest need to maximize impact. In recent years, the Federal Government has deepened its engagement with communities, recognizing the critical role of these partnerships in enabling Americans to live healthier and more prosperous lives. Since 2015, the Community Solutions Task Force, comprising executive departments, offices, and agencies (agencies) across the Federal Government, has served as the primary interagency coordinator of agency work to engage with communities to deliver improved outcomes. This order builds on recent work to facilitate inter-agency and community-level collaboration to meet the unique needs of communities in a way that reflects these communities' local assets, economies, geography, size, history, strengths, talent networks, and visions for the future.\nSec. 2. Principles. Our effort to modernize the Federal Government's work with communities is rooted in the following principles:\n(a) A community-driven, locally led vision and long-term plan for clear outcomes should guide individual projects.\n(b) The Federal Government should coordinate its efforts at the Federal, regional, State, local, tribal, and community level, and with cross-sector partners, to offer a more seamless process for communities to access needed support and ensure equitable investments.\n(c) The Federal Government should help communities identify, develop, and share local solutions, rely on data to determine what does and does not work, and harness technology and modern collaboration and engagement methods to help share these solutions and help communities meet their local goals.\nSec. 3. Community Solutions Council.\n(a) Establishment. There is hereby established a Council for Community Solutions (Council), led by two Co-Chairs. One Co-Chair will be an Assistant to the President or the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, as designated by the President. The second Co-Chair will be rotated every 4 years and designated by the President from among the heads of the Departments of Justice, Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, and Education, and the Environmental Protection Agency (Agency Co-Chair).\n(b) Membership. The Council shall consist of the following members:\n(i) the Secretary of State;\n(ii) the Secretary of the Treasury;\n(iii) the Secretary of Defense;\n(iv) the Attorney General;\n(v) the Secretary of the Interior;\n(vi) the Secretary of Agriculture;\n(vii) the Secretary of Commerce;\n(viii) the Secretary of Labor;\n(ix) the Secretary of Health and Human Services;\n(x) the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development;\n(xi) the Secretary of Transportation;\n(xii) the Secretary of Energy;\n(xiii) the Secretary of Education;\n(xiv) the Secretary of Veterans Affairs;\n(xv) the Secretary of Homeland Security;\n(xvi) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency;\n(xvii) the Administrator of General Services;\n(xviii) the Administrator of the Small Business Administration;\n(xix) the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation for National and Community Service;\n(xx) the Chairperson of the National Endowment for the Arts;\n(xxi) the Director of the Institute for Museum and Library Services;\n(xxii) the Federal Co-Chair of the Delta Regional Authority;\n(xxiii) the Federal Co-Chair of the Appalachian Regional Commission;\n(xxiv) the Director of the Office of Personnel Management;\n(xxv) the Director of the Office of Management and Budget;\n(xxvi) the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers;\n(xxvii) the Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Affairs and Public Engagement; (xxviii) the Assistant to the President and Cabinet Secretary;\n(xxix) the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and Director of the National Economic Council;\n(xxx) the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality;\n(xxxi) the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy;\n(xxxii) the Assistant to the President and Chief Technology Officer;\n(xxxiii) the Administrator of the United States Digital Service; and\n(xxxiv) other officials, as the Co-Chairs may designate or invite to participate.\n(c) Administration.\n(i) The President will designate one of the Co-Chairs to appoint or designate, as appropriate, an Executive Director, who shall coordinate the Council's activities. The department, agency, or component within the Executive Office of the President in which the Executive Director is appointed or designated, as appropriate, (funding entity) shall provide funding and administrative support for the Council to the extent permitted by law and within existing appropriations as may be necessary for the performance of its functions.\n(ii) To the extent permitted by law, including the Economy Act, and within existing appropriations, participating agencies may detail staff to the funding entity to support the Council's coordination and implementation efforts.\n(iii) The Co-Chairs shall convene regular meetings of the Council, determine its agenda, and direct its work. At the direction of the Co-Chairs, the Council may establish subgroups consisting exclusively of Council members or their designees, as appropriate.\n(iv) A member of the Council may designate a senior-level official who is part of the member's department, agency, or office to perform the Council functions of the member.\nSec. 4. Mission and Priorities of the Council. (a) The Council shall foster collaboration across agencies, policy councils, and offices to coordinate actions, identify working solutions to share broadly, and develop and implement policy recommendations that put the community-driven, locally led vision at the center of policymaking. The Council shall:\n(i) Work across agencies to coordinate investments in initiatives and practices that align the work of the Federal Government to have the greatest impact on the lives of individuals and communities.\n(ii) Use evidence-based practices in policymaking, including identifying existing solutions, scaling up practices that are working, and designing solutions with regular input of the individuals and communities to be served.\n(iii) Invest in recruiting, training, and retaining talent to further the effective delivery of services to individuals and communities and empower them with best-practice community engagement options, open government transparency methods, equitable policy approaches, technical assistance and capacity building tools, and data-driven practice.\n(b) Consistent with the principles set forth in this order and in accordance with applicable law, including the Federal Advisory Committee Act, the Council should conduct outreach to representatives of nonprofit organizations, civil rights organizations, businesses, labor and professional organizations, start-up and entrepreneurial communities, State, local, and tribal government agencies, school districts, youth, elected officials, seniors, faith and other community-based organizations, philanthropies, technologists, other institutions of local importance, and other interested or affected persons with relevant expertise in the expansion and improvement of efforts to build local capacity, ensure equity, and address economic, social, environmental, and other issues in communities or regions.\nSec. 5. Executive Orders 13560 and 13602, and Building Upon Other Efforts. This order supersedes Executive Order 13560 of December 14, 2010 (White House Council for Community Solutions), and Executive Order 13602 of March 15, 2012 (Establishing a White House Council on Strong Cities, Strong Communities), which are hereby revoked.\nThis Council builds on existing efforts involving Federal working groups, task forces, memoranda of agreement, and initiatives, including the Community Solutions Task Force, the Federal Working Groups dedicated to supporting the needs and priorities of local leadership in Detroit, Baltimore, and Pine Ridge; the Interagency Working Group on Environmental Justice; the Partnership for Sustainable Communities; Local Foods, Local Places; Performance Partnership Pilots for Disconnected Youth; Empowerment Zones; StrikeForce; Partnerships for Opportunity and Workforce and Economic Revitalization; the Neighborhood Revitalization Initiative; Climate Action Champions; Better Communities Alliance; Investing in Manufacturing Communities Partnership; Promise Zones; and the 2016 Memorandum of Agreement on Interagency Technical Assistance. The Council shall also coordinate with existing Chief Officer Councils across the government with oversight responsibility for human capital, performance improvement, and financial assistance.\nSec. 6. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof, or the status of that department or agency within the Federal Government; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nBARACK OBAMA\nThe White House,\nNovember 16, 2016.", "timestamp": "2016-11-16", "title": "Executive Order 13748—Establishing a Community Solutions Council"}

Cassidy, R-LA, and five cosponsors)\nThe Administration strongly opposes S. 3110, the American Energy and Conservation Act. The bill would, among other things, change existing revenue sharing laws to increase the amount that certain States and counties would receive from energy production on Federal lands and waters, thereby reducing the fair return on the development of these minerals to taxpayers across the country for their shared resources. S. 3110 would have significant and long-term costs to the Federal Treasury.\nThe Department of the Interior, which oversees the development of about 23 percent of domestic energy supplies collects, on average, over $10 billion annually from the development of Federal minerals, including fossil and renewable energy resources. Various statutes govern how these revenues are allocated depending on the resource type and location. About half of the Federal revenue from onshore energy development is shared with States or counties, with the remainder deposited in the Treasury, where it offsets annual appropriations or otherwise contributes to deficit reduction. The majority of revenue generated from offshore energy leases on the Federal Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) goes to the Treasury, while a portion goes to fund important Federal conservation programs through contributions to the Land and Water Conservation Fund and the Historic Preservation Fund. Through the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA), the amount of OCS revenue allocated to revenue sharing payments to nearby States and counties is already set to increase dramatically in fiscal year 2018.\nThe Administration takes seriously its responsibility to the public for the stewardship of the Nation's energy resources and public assets that generate royalty revenue from Federal leases. It remains committed to ensuring that American taxpayers receive a fair return from the sale of public resources owned by all Americans. That is why the President's 2017 Budget proposes to redirect future GOMESA revenue sharing payments to the dual objectives of reducing the deficit and enhancing the resilience of coastal communities nationwide to the impacts of climate change. In contrast, the provisions of S. 3110 would ultimately reduce the fair return on the development of these minerals to taxpayers across the country for their shared resources, would result in reductions of billions of dollars in deposits to the Treasury, and would add significantly to the Federal deficit. If the President were presented with S. 3110, his senior advisors would recommend he veto the bill.", "timestamp": "2016-11-17", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: S. 3110 - American Energy and Conservation Act of 2016"}

Our engagement with Germany spans the breadth of international relations, and is rooted in friendship, our close trading relationship, and our common values. German-American cooperation on international political, economic, and security matters is critical to our countries' continued prosperity and to the stability of the international system. Our work together is rooted in extensive people-to-people ties and pursued through close coordination at the most senior levels.\nIn the political sphere, Germany stands at the center of European affairs and plays a key leadership role as a member of the G-7, G-20, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the European Union, the Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe, and the United Nations. The United States and Germany work side by side to maintain peace and freedom, and Germany plays an important role in NATO's core mission of collective defense. Germany is also a key contributor to U.S.-led coalition efforts to degrade and destroy ISIL.\nOur deep economic ties are based on dynamic and growing trade and investment. Germany is the largest European economy, and in 2015 the United States became Germany's fourth largest supplier of goods and became Germany's number one global customer. Together, our companies have created over one million jobs on both sides of the Atlantic. It is vital that we continue to work to strengthen what is already a robust trade and investment relationship based on shared values, which underpins our deep and enduring bond. Germany was a close partner in securing the historic Paris Agreement on climate change, and worked alongside the United States to push the Agreement into force in less than a year. This momentum sends a powerful signal to world markets that we are accelerating our transition towards a low-emissions economy.\nThe United States and Germany maintain strong cultural ties, with more Americans claiming German or partial German ancestry than any other national origin.

Ladies and gentlemen, I'm delighted to be able to welcome today for the sixth time, the President of the United States of America, Barack Obama, to Germany, in his capacity as President of the United States. Let us remind ourselves: After the—visiting us in his capacity as candidate here in Berlin, we then met in Baden-Baden. We then met in Dresden and Buchenwald. We saw each other when he gave a speech at the Brandenburg Gate. In Elmau, we met again at the G-7. Then, Hannover Faire comes to mind. And today he is again here in Berlin.\nSo 8 years are coming to a close. This is the last visit of Barack Obama to our country, to Germany. I am very glad that he chose Germany as one of the, sort of, stopovers on this trip. And thank you very much. Thank you for the friendship you've always demonstrated. Thank you for the reliable friendship and partnership you demonstrated in very difficult hours of our relationship. So let me again pay tribute to what we've been able to achieve, to what we discussed, to what we were able to bring about.\nDifficult hours come to mind, as I said, of those that had a bearing on the cooperation of our intelligence services, and I'm very grateful that Barack Obama, as President, very much put protection of privacy on the agenda today. Due to the fact of Islamist terrorism all over the world through the threat of IS, we recognize how important the cooperation with intelligence services, and here first and foremost, also with the services of the United States is. We need this cooperation. And we say this from a German perspective very clearly and unequivocally: Our bilateral relations are very good; they're very close.\nIn the areas of business, of the economy, the United States of America last year were our most important trading partners—partner. Both for Germany and the European Union, the European Union and the United States of America are the big, important economic areas for us, which is why I've always come out strongly in favor of concluding a trade agreement with the United States of America.\nWe have made progress, quite a lot of progress. They cannot be stopped, those negotiations. But we'll keep what we have achieved so far, and I'm absolutely certain that one day we will come back to what we have achieved and build on it, because that is my deep conviction. Globalization—and I think we share this conviction—is that globalization needs to be shaped politically. It needs to be given a human face. But we cannot allow to fall back into preglobalization times. So this conclusion of trade agreements that go beyond the scope of mere trade—tariff agreements, customs agreements, are most important, and I'm very pleased that we were able to bring this to fruition between Canada and the EU.\nWe made great progress, particularly if we look at one of the great global issues, namely, climate protection. Without the engagement of the current administration under the leadership of Barack Obama, this Paris Agreement would never have come about. There has been a change in the attitude in the United States towards that agreement, but there is also a better cooperation with China. So last year, we were able to conclude a Paris climate agreement, which will lead the way for the rest of the world, which is groundbreaking. And together with the sustainable development goals of the agenda 2030 for the whole world, this is indeed a sea change, I think, that we see here, and step by step, it will be implemented.\nThere's another point that I wanted to mention here, particularly, the engagement and commitment to Africa. For us Europeans, Africa as a neighboring continent is of prime importance. The development of African countries is in our very own vested interest. We, as Germans, but also we, as members of the European Union, will have to deal with this. It will be at the very top of our agenda.\nThere are a lot of areas where we cooperate: fight against ISIL, for example. Here, Germany was able to contribute to a certain extent, in certain areas. We'll continue to do so: for example, in supporting the Peshmerga, in air policing. But we also have to acknowledge that the United States of America bear most of the burden. They bear the brunt of this responsibility.\nSo I take your remarks very seriously, Barack, that the European Union as a whole, but also Germany, needs to recognize that this is our alliance, our common alliance, our transatlantic alliance, that we have to step up our engagement. Because, in the long run, we will not be allowed to accept this imbalance as regards the contributions we give to this alliance. And we have understood this message, and we have started to react.\nWe have worked very closely together, for example, in Afghanistan. We're continuing to do so. I'm very pleased that this military engagement—together with a political road map that we've developed—we were able to continue. We want to bring about a political solution there.\nWe work very closely together in—on the issue of annexation of Crimea and Russia's attempt to actually conquer Ukraine. And actually, they did so, conquered part of the territory. We tried to come to a peaceful settlement here on this.\nSo our interests are very much aligned. Our attempts of cooperation are very much aligned. We continue to build on what we've already achieved in these last months of the administration, and we will continue also with the new administration.\nThis is the end of an 8-year cooperation that was very close, indeed. From a German point of view, German-American and European-American relations are a pillar of our foreign policy, a foreign policy that is obviously guided by interests, but that is very much also committed to shared values. So we have a platform—democracy, freedom, respect of human rights—that we would like to see respected all over the world and also a peaceful world order. And we have shared those values; we continue to share those values. And obviously, we will continue to cooperate with the new administration.\nBut today I think a word of gratitude is at hand. Thank you very much for this very close, very intensive cooperation.\nPresident Obama. Well, thank you so much. It is wonderful to be back in Berlin. This is my sixth visit to Germany. It will not be my last. I have somehow continued to miss Oktoberfest. [Laughter] So that's probably something that is better for me to do as a former President rather than as President. I'll have more fun.\nIt's also wonderful to be back with my great friend and ally, Chancellor Merkel. As I reflect back over the last 8 years, I could not ask for a steadier or a more reliable partner on the world stage, often through some very challenging times. So I want to thank you for your friendship, for your leadership, and your commitment to our alliance. And I want to thank the German people for the incredible partnership that our countries have been able to establish all these years.\nLast week marked the 27th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. The United States was proud to stand with the people of Germany as this nation and this continent reunited and rebuilt and reached for a better future. And it's a reminder that the commitment of the United States to Europe is enduring, and it's rooted in the values we share, values that Angela just mentioned: our commitment to democracy, our commitment to rule of law, our commitment to the dignity of all people, in our own countries and around the world.\nOur alliance with our NATO partners has been a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy for nearly 70 years—in good times and in bad and through Presidents of both parties—because the United States has a fundamental interest in Europe's stability and security. The commitment that Angela and I share to this guiding principle has formed the basis for our conversations this afternoon.\nWe discussed our efforts to keep our countries competitive and to create jobs and opportunity on both sides of the Atlantic. The negotiations on agreements like T-TIP have been challenging, and obviously, at a moment when there's concerns about globalization and the benefits that accrue to particular people, it is important that those negotiations and channels of communication remain. Because, ultimately, what we have shown over the last several decades is that markets and trade and commerce can create prosperity in all of our countries—that it's not a win-lose situation, but it can be a win-win situation.\nAnd at a time when the European project is facing challenges, it's especially important to show the benefits of economic integration by continuing to invest in our people and working to reduce inequality, both within and across our countries.\nI reiterated our hope that negotiations over the United Kingdom's exit from the EU will be conducted in a smooth and orderly and transparent fashion and preserve as closely as possible the economic and political and security relationships between the U.K. and EU. And I continue to believe what I said in Hannover: that the EU remains one of the world's great political and economic achievements and that those achievements should not be taken for granted, that they need to be nurtured and cultivated and protected and fought for.\nBecause the achievements that we've seen on this continent, in contrast to a divided Europe of the previous century, are ones that remind us of how important it is that we work together, and that we are willing to uphold principles that have resulted in unprecedented prosperity and security throughout Europe and around the world.\nWith the threat of climate change only becoming more urgent, Angela and I focused on the need for American and EU leadership to advance global cooperation. Both of our nations were proud to join the Paris climate agreement, which the world should work to implement quickly. Continued global leadership on climate—in addition to increasing private investment in clean energy—is going to be critical to meeting this growing threat.\nOf course, we discussed our commitment to meeting shared security challenges, from countering cyber threats to ensuring that Iran continues to live up to the terms of the Iran nuclear deal. I commended Angela for her leadership, along with President Hollande, in working to resolve the conflict in Ukraine. We continued to stand with the people of Ukraine and for the basic principle that nations have a right to determine their own destiny. And we discussed the importance of maintaining sanctions until Russia fully complies with the Minsk agreement.\nAs part of the coalition against ISIL, we are putting that terrorist network under tremendous pressure. Here in Berlin, this week, coalition members are meeting to ensure we remain unified and focused on our mission to destroy ISIL. We are very grateful for the vital contributions Germany has made to this fight: training local forces in Iraq, sharing intelligence, providing reconnaissance aircraft, including the recent deployment of additional NATO AWACS. And as Iraqi forces continue the liberation of Mosul, I am pleased that NATO will be meeting the commitment we made in Warsaw to begin training additional forces in Iraq, which started this January.\nWe also continue to stand united with Germany and our NATO allies in our ongoing efforts to build peace and stability in Afghanistan.\nOn Syria, it's clear that the indiscriminate attacks on civilians by the Asad regime and Russia will only worsen the humanitarian catastrophe and that a negotiated end to the conflict is the only way to achieve lasting peace in Syria. Angela and I also agreed the need for a comprehensive and humane response to the devastating humanitarian crisis in Syria and for the influx of migrants and refugees from around the world.\nWe need to build on the progress achieved at the U.N. Refugee Summit, which yielded new commitments from some 50 nations and organizations. The United States is doing our part by increasing the number of refugees we resettle. And I want again to commend Angela and, more importantly, the German people for the extraordinary leadership and compassion that you have shown in the face of what I know is a very difficult challenge. You are not alone in trying to deal with this challenge. This is not an issue that any one country should bear, but is in need of an international response. And I not only intend to make sure that we have put in place more robust support from the United States, but I'm hoping that that continues beyond my administration.\nOn this final visit, I am reminded of the visit I made here before I became President. It was 8 years ago. I had no gray hair. [Laughter] But I believe today what I said then: If you want a model for what is possible, if you want to see how to build a peaceful and prosperous and dynamic society, then look at Berlin, and look at Germany. Look at Chancellor Merkel. Her personal story helps to tell the story of incredible achievement that the German people have embarked on and, I think, is something that you should be very proud of.\nIt is not inevitable that we make progress; it requires hard work. Sometimes, it may seem as if progress is stalled. But what the history of postwar Germany shows is that strength and determination and focus and adherence to the values that we care about will result in a better future for our children and our grandchildren.\nAnd on behalf of the American people, I want to thank the German people, I want to thank Chancellor Merkel, for your deep friendship and your steadfast partnership. So vielen dank.\n[At this point, the moderator spoke briefly in German, but no translation was provided.]\nWhite House Press Secretary Joshua R. Earnest. Yes. Jeff Mason from Reuters.\nChancellor Angela Merkel/Russia-U.S. Relations/President-Elect Donald J. Trump/Cybersecurity Q. Thank you very much. Mr. President, you and the President-elect have very different views on Russia. After your meeting with him last week, can you assure Chancellor Merkel that a Trump administration would also support strong sanctions against Moscow? Similarly, what have you told President Putin about Russia's influence on the U.S. election? And how would you advise European countries to deal with the same threat? And lastly, if I may, would you like to see your friend, Chancellor Merkel, run for reelection next year? [Laughter]\nFrau Merkel, eine Frage auf Deutsch——\nPresident Obama. Uh-oh. Pulling out your German, showing off. [Laughter]\n[The reporter continued in German, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nQ. Has the American President calmed you in the sense that, on the policy of his successor on climate change and Russia, he has allayed your fears? And how—are you concerned that the common European policy towards Russia will collapse? And after the election of Mr. Trump, would you—as a sign of civility, wouldn't you actually have to declare that you are going to be a candidate again?\nPresident Obama. Well, I try to make it a rule not to meddle in other people's politics. All I can say is that Chancellor Merkel has been an outstanding partner. And Chancellor Merkel is perhaps the only leader left among our closest allies that was there when I arrived, so in some ways, we are now the veterans of many challenges over the last 8 years. And although we have not always been in sync on every issue, in terms of our core values, in terms of her integrity, her truthfulness, her thoughtfulness, her doing her homework, knowing her facts, her commitment to looking out for the interests of the German people first, but recognizing that part of good leadership on behalf of the nation requires engaging the world as a whole and participating effectively in multilateral institutions, I think she's been outstanding.\nSo it's up to her whether she wants to stand again, and then ultimately, it will be up to the German people to decide what the future holds. If I were here and I were German and I had a vote, I might support her. [Laughter] But it's—I don't know whether that hurts or helps. [Laughter]\nWith respect to Russia, my principal approach to Russia has been constant since I first came into office. Russia is an important country. It is a military superpower. It has influence in the region, and it has influence around the world. And in order for us to solve many big problems around the world, it is in our interest to work with Russia and obtain their cooperation.\nI think we should all hope for a Russia that is successful, where its people are employed and the economy is growing and they are having good relationships with their neighbors and participating constructively on big issues like climate change.\nSo I've sought a constructive relationship with Russia, but what I have also been is realistic in recognizing that there are some significant differences in how Russia views the world and how we view the world.\nThe values that we talked about—the values of democracy and free speech and international norms and rule of law, respecting the ability of other countries to determine their own destiny and preserve their sovereignty and territorial integrity—those things are not something that we can set aside. And so in—on issues like Ukraine, on issues like Syria, we've had very significant differences. And my hope is that the President-elect coming in takes a similarly constructive approach, finding areas where we can cooperate with Russia where our values and interests align, but that the President-elect also is willing to stand up to Russia where they are deviating from our values and international norms.\nAnd I don't expect that the President-elect will follow exactly our blueprint or our approach, but my hope is, is that he does not simply take a realpolitik approach and suggest that if we just cut some deals with Russia, even if it hurts people or even if it violates international norms or even if it leaves smaller countries vulnerable or creates long-term problems in regions like Syria—that we just do whatever is convenient at the time. And that will be something that I think we'll learn more about as the President-elect puts his team together.\nI am encouraged by the President-elect's insistence that NATO is a commitment that does not change. And his full commitment to NATO as the foundation for our international security, I think, is very important.\nAnd finally, in terms of my conversations with President Putin, these are conversations that took place before the election. As I indicated, there has been very clear proof that they have engaged in cyber attacks. This isn't new. It's not unique to Russia. There are a number of states where we've seen low-level cyber attacks and industrial espionage and other behavior that we think should be out of bounds. And I delivered a clear and forceful message that, although we recognize Russia's intelligence gathering will sometimes take place even if we don't like it, there's a difference between that and them either meddling with elections or going after private organizations or commercial entities, and that we're monitoring it carefully and we will respond appropriately if and when we see this happening.\nI do think that this whole area of cyber is something that, at an international level, we have to work on and develop frameworks and international norms so that we don't see a cyber arms race. A lot of countries have advanced capabilities, and given the vulnerabilities of our infrastructure and our economies to digital platforms, we have to be careful in making sure that this doesn't become a lawless, low-level battlefield.\nAnd we've started trying to put together some principles that were adopted in the G-20, the G-7, and at the U.N. levels, but a lot more work remains to be done on that front.\nChancellor Merkel. Well, allow me if I may to underline, first of all, that I'm very much impressed that, in spite of a very tough election campaign, this transition period in the United States of America, because it is—it follows democratic principles, is working smoothly. Because this is all about the American people, it's about the destiny of the American people, the outgoing administration is sharing its knowledge, its expertise with the incoming administration. And this to us is a sign of encouragement to continue the good cooperation that we have built between the United States of America and the Federal Republic of Germany. And that is in our mutual interest.\nSo we will continue this. I will continue this with—I approach this with an open mind, and I'll do it on the basis of a deep conviction with President-elect Donald Trump.\nSecondly, on Russia, I can only repeat what the President said previously. This is all about respecting certain principles. And I'm saying this from a European vantage point, from a European—from a German vantage point, sorry. The fact that for over 70 years, we have been able to enjoy peace, to live in peace very much depends on territorial integrity and sovereignty of each and every European country being respected. In view of the European history, the reverse would be the start of a very bitter road down a slippery slope, and we have to nip this in the bud. We have to stand up resolutely against any such attempts.\nBut we are pinning our hopes on political efforts. This is why we launched the Normandy process, in close coordination with the United States of America. And particularly from a German perspective—from the European perspective—I can only say again, Russia is our neighbor. And just look at Poland—the sort of European perspective this has. So we have an interest in seeing this relationship be a good one. We have a lot of historical ties, of course, a history that we share. But this mustn't keep us from, wherever we feel there are very grave differences of opinion, to raise them with them, but again, with political means and always trying to work for political settlements.\nAnd this is what I'm going to continue to work on with all my heart. So on the question whether I will put up a candidacy, I will do this at the appropriate time, and this is not today.\nPresident Obama's Governing Philosophy/Effects of Globalization, Technological Innovation, and Social Change/Nationalism\nQ. German Press Agency, Kristina Dunst. Mr. President, your country is divided. You, as first Black President—as first African American President, who did so many things so differently, who raised so much hope all over the world, do you think that you have, perhaps in a way, too—put too much of a strain, maybe too much of demands on the Americans? And to what extent do you think your successor may well be a threat to the rest of the world, to the security? Because there are, after all, nuclear weapons here in Germany to which he has access now.\nWill you want to be now, Madam Chancellor, see to it under this—your administration try to make Europe and Germany less dependent on the United States? And are you afraid of this wave of populism hitting Germany, hitting Europe, as well?\nAnd a personal question: President Obama paid tribute to you as an outstanding politician. You are somewhat more sober in—when you describe your partner. How difficult is it for you to take leave today of your partner?\nPresident Obama. My guiding principle as President has been to try to do the right thing even when it's not politically convenient; to look at long term trends in our economy, in our society, in the international sphere, and, using my best judgment, shape policies that will serve the American people, keep them safe, keep our economy growing, put people back to work, and best ensure peace, cooperation, and stability around the world.\nAnd based on current surveys of public opinion in the United States, it turns out that the majority of Americans think I've done a pretty good job, that we haven't, in fact, gone too fast, as you describe it.\nBut what is certainly true is that the American people—just like the German people, just like the British, and people around the world—are seeing extraordinarily rapid change. The world is shrinking. Economies have become much more integrated, and demographics are shifting. Because of the Internet and communications, the clash of cultures is much more direct. People feel, I think, less certain about their identity, less certain about economic security. They're looking for some means of control.\nAnd what that means is, is that the politics in all of our countries is going to require us to manage technology and global integration and all these demographic shifts in a way that makes people feel more control, that gives them more confidence in their future, but does not resort to simplistic answers or divisions of race or tribe or the crude nationalism, which I think can be contrasted to the pride of patriotism that we all feel about our respective countries.\nAnd I think that our politics everywhere are going to be going through this bumpy phase. But as long as we stay true to our democratic principles—as long as elections have integrity, as long as we respect freedom of speech, freedom of religion, as long as there are checks and balances in our governments so that the people have the ability to not just make judgments about how well government is serving them, but also change governments if it's—they're not serving them well—then I have confidence that over the long term, progress will continue.\nAnd I think it's especially important for those of us who believe in a world where we're interdependent, that believes in mutual interests and mutual respect between nations, it's particularly important that we reach out to everybody in our countries—those who feel disaffected, those who feel left behind by globalization—and address their concerns in constructive ways, as opposed to more destructive ways.\nAnd I think that can be done. But it's hard. It requires creativity. It requires effective communications. Part of what's changed in politics is social media and how people are receiving information. It's easier to make negative attacks and simplistic slogans than it is to communicate complex policies. But we'll figure it out.\nSo, ultimately, I remain optimistic about not just America's futures, but the direction that the world is going in. And part of what makes me most optimistic is, if you look at the attitudes of young people. Across the board, young people are much more comfortable with respecting differences. They are much more comfortable with diversity. They are much less likely to express attitudes that divide us between \"us\" and \"them.\" They see themselves as part of a global economy that they can navigate successfully and are showing enormous creativity and entrepreneurship and working with each other across borders.\nSo that's where the future is. But we have to create that bridge to the future. And that means making sure we're paying attention to the wages of workers in countries and making sure that we're investing in their education and their skills, that we are growing the economy in smart ways and rebuilding our infrastructure and investing in science and development, and that we stay true to those values that helped to get us here. And if we do that, I think we're going to be fine.\nChancellor Merkel. Well, on the issue, first, of independence of Germany, after the time of National Socialism, Germany has been given an enormous amount of help, particularly and also from the United States of America. The fact that we were able to enjoy European—sorry, German unification is due, first and foremost, to the help of the United States of America. And ever since Germany was able to regain its unity, it is in an even stronger position to give its contribution to upholding this order to which we feel committed and for which particularly people in the German Democratic Republic stood out there in the streets to keep this up, to maintain this order, particularly also in our country.\nNow, we're trying to do more than it used to be 26 years ago. And there are a number of other areas where we have to also make a stronger contribution. We will all have to make—do more in development cooperation. It's important that these disparities in the living conditions cannot be allowed in this digital period to be too marked. Each and every one must be given an opportunity to participate, which is why Germany's fate, in many ways, depends on the firmness of its alliance with NATO, with the European Union. We cannot stand alone with 80 million people. In this world of today, you cannot, when you just stand on your own, achieve much, even though you may be economically strong. So alliances are part of our destiny as a nation, part of our future as a nation. And this is what guides me in my policy, what guides my government as a whole.\nSecondly, this wave of populism that seems to engulf us, well, look at—and it seems, in your words, to come from the United States. Look at the European Parliament. We—there are a lot of people who are looking for simplistic solutions, for—who are sort of preaching policies of, well, very unfriendly policies. We have them here in Europe too. We have them here in Germany too.\nAnd to take up where the President left off, digitization is, in a way, a disruptive force, a disruptive technological force that brings about deep-seated change, transformation of a society. Look at the history of the printing press, when this was invented, what sort of consequences this had, or industrialization, what sort of consequences that had. Very often, it led to enormous transformational processes within individual societies, and it took a while until societies learned how to find the right kind of policies to contain this and to manage and steer this. And I think we live in a period of profound transformation, very similar to when we had a transition from agricultural societies to industrial societies.\nNow, when we, for example, see shifts of huge production lines from certain areas to other countries, people tend to ask the question, where's my place in this modern world? We have this here, this tendency in our country. We have it in other countries. Trying to keep a society together, trying to keep the older and the younger people together, trying to keep those who live in rural areas together with those who live in cities is one of the most important and most noble tasks of politicians these days—trying to see to it that each and every one can find his or her place.\nBut those that are—belong purportedly to certain groups say, we are the people, and not the others—that is something that we cannot allow to happen. That is something that I think, at the time in the GDR—at the time when we had this in the GDR, when the people stood in the street and said, we are the people—that was something that filled me with great joy. But the fact that these people have hijacked it certain is not something that fills me with great joy. We have to find new ways of addressing people, new ways of getting into contact with people. But I'm optimistic that we'll be able to do so.\nNow, taking leave from my partner and friend, well, yes, it is hard. If you've worked together with somebody very well, leave-taking is very difficult. But we are all politicians. We all know that democracy lives off change. So, in the United States of America, the Constitution has very clear stipulations on this. It's a tough rule: Eight years, and that's it. Out goes the President, and a new one comes in. So if it's in the German interest to have good transatlantic relations, well, the task is also to look ahead. But our personal—we have freedom of movement in the whole of Germany, so if we want to see each other, well, I'm game. So we're not completely out of this world, as we would say.\nPress Secretary Earnest. The next question will come from Margaret Brennan of CBS News.\nPolitical Protest/2016 Presidential Election/Democracy/Germany-U.S. Relations\nQ. Thank you very much, Mr. President. You've spoken a great deal about what you've characterized as kind of a crude form of nationalism, perhaps, on the rise. I'm wondering if you would advise some of those protestors at home to stop demonstrating against some of the charged rhetoric that has been used by Donald Trump. And I'm wondering, as well, if you've advised your successor to be extra mindful of what you see as some very worrisome trends, particularly when it comes to making his own potentially powerful staff picks.\nLastly, sir, in these final weeks of your Presidency, do you believe you have any leverage to stop Bashar al-Asad and Vladimir Putin from continuing to bomb Aleppo?\nChancellor Merkel, I'd like to ask you, Bashar al-Asad has described Donald Trump as a natural ally. Your own Foreign Minister has described Donald Trump as a preacher of hate. I'm wondering, would you tell Americans that they now have a perception problem?\nPresident Obama. One of the great things about our democracy is, it expresses itself in all sorts of ways, and that includes people protesting. I've been the subject of protests during the course of my 8 years, and I suspect that there's not a President in our history that, at some point, hasn't been subject to these protests. So I would not advise people who feel strongly or are concerned about some of the issues that have been raised during the course of the campaign—I wouldn't advise them to be silent.\nWhat I would advise—what I advised before the election and what I will continue to advise after the election—is that elections matter, voting matters, organizing matters, being informed on the issues matter. And what I consistently say to young people—I say it in the United States, but I'll say it here in Germany and across Europe—do not take for granted our systems of government and our way of life.\nI think there is a tendency—because we have lived in an era that has been largely stable and peaceful, at least in advanced countries, where living standards have generally gone up—there is a tendency, I think, to assume that that's always the case. And it's not. Democracy is hard work.\nIn the United States, if 43 percent of eligible voters do not vote, then democracy is weakened. If we are not serious about facts and what's true and what's not—and particularly in an age of social media where so many people are getting their information in soundbites and snippets off their phones—if we can't discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda, then we have problems. If people, whether they are conservative or liberal, left or right, are unwilling to compromise and engage in the democratic process and are taking absolutist views and demonizing opponents, then democracy will break down.\nAnd so I think my most important advice is to understand what are the foundations of a healthy democracy, and how we have to engage in citizenship continuously, not just when something upsets us, not just when there's an election, or when an issue pops up for a few weeks.\nIt's hard work. And the good news is, I think there are a lot of young people, certainly, who were involved in my campaigns and I think continue to be involved in work, not just politically but through nonprofits and other organizations, that can carry this hard work of democracy forward.\nBut I do think sometimes there's complacency. Here in Europe, I think that there are a lot of young people who forget the issues that were at stake during the cold war, who forget what it meant to have a wall. And I'll be honest, there have been times when I listened to the rhetoric in Europe where an easy equivalence somehow between the United States and Russia and between how our governments operate versus other governments operate—where those distinctions aren't made. I've said many times around the world that, like any government, like any country, like any set of human institutions, we have our flaws; we've operated imperfectly. There are times when we've made mistakes. There are times where I've made mistakes or our administration hasn't always aligned ourselves with the values that we need to align ourselves with. It's a work of constant improvement.\nBut I can say to the German people that the United States has been good for Germany, has looked out for Germany, has provided security for Germany, has helped to rebuild Germany and unify Germany. And I can say, across Europe, that many principles that have been taken for granted here around free speech and around civil liberties and an independent judiciary and fighting corruption, those are principles that, not perfectly, but generally, we have tried to apply not just in our own country, but also with respect to our foreign policy.\nAnd that should be remembered. Because at an age where there's so much active misinformation—and it's packaged very well, and it looks the same when you see it on a Facebook page or you turn on your television—where some overzealousness on the part of a U.S. official is equated with constant and severe repression elsewhere, if everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made, then we won't know what to protect. We won't know what to fight for. And you—we can lose so much of what we've gained in terms of the kind of democratic freedoms and market-based economies and prosperity that we've come to take for granted.\nThat was a long answer, wasn't it? I don't remember if I—there was a second part to it. I was—I got all caught up in that one [Laughter].\nPresident-Elect Donald J. Trump/Syria\nQ. I asked you if you advised the President-elect on his—[inaudible]—to be mindful of his—[inaudible].\nPresident Obama. Yes, I did. I did. He ran a extraordinarily unconventional campaign, and it resulted in the biggest political upset in perhaps modern political history—American history. And that means that he now has to transition to governance. And I—what I said to him was that what may work in generating enthusiasm or passion during elections may be different than what will work in terms of unifying the country and gaining the trust even of those who didn't support him.\nAnd he's indicated his willingness to—his understanding of that. But you're absolutely right that that has to reflect itself not only in the things he says, but also how he fills out his administration. And my hope is, is that that's something that he is thinking about, because not only is the President of the United States somebody that the entire country looks to for direction, but sets the agenda internationally in a lot of ways.\nQ. And Syria?\nPresident Obama. With respect to Syria, we are going to continue to work, as we have over the last 5, 6 years, to push towards a political transition and settlement.\nIt would be naive of me to suggest that with Russia committed militarily as it is to supporting what, in many cases, are barbarous tactics by the Asad regime to crush the opposition, the sort of indiscriminate bombing that we've been seeing not just in Aleppo, but in many parts of the country over the last several years—it would be naive of me to suggest that there's going to be a sudden, 180-degree turn in policy by either Asad or Russia or Iran at this point. But we are going to continue to make the argument. We are going to continue to try to find humanitarian steps that can reach the people there. We're going to continue to try to obtain cessations of hostilities that lessen the human tragedy and the migration that's taking place.\nBut ultimately, the way this is going to be resolved is going to have to be a recognition by Russia and a willingness to pressure Asad that a lasting, durable peace with a functioning country requires the consent of people. You cannot purchase people's consent through killing them. They haven't made that transition yet, but we're going to keep on trying.\nChancellor Merkel. I think I can speak for the whole of the federal Government when I say that we are no longer in a election mode in the United States, we're in postelection mode. There is an interest of the Federal Republic of Germany to cooperate well with the United States of America. This goes for each and every President on the basis of shared values, and I believe that these are, indeed, shared values and should be shared values.\nSo as to my position on President Asad, Asad as President has actively tried to kill his own people. He has bombed them with barrel bombs in a most terrible way. He has brought untold suffering over his people, if you look at Aleppo and other places. When you talk to the many Syrian refugees who have fled here to Germany, they will be able to tell you their own personal story, and the majority of them—the great majority of them—fled from Asad, and most of them not even fled the IS. So I don't see him as an ally.\nPresident-Elect Donald J. Trump/Germany-U.S. Relations\nQ. Thank you very much. Mr. President, you describe your hopes rather more in great historical terms. Let me break this down to months and years. The fact that Stephen Bannon was made as chief strategist, meeting Mr. Farage, and the fact that prominent Republican representatives did not decide to join this transition team—what makes you confident, against the background of this, that President Trump can be a reliable partner to the world and to Europe and Germany?\nNow, Madam Chancellor, if you hear those words of praise of the President with regard to you—this, what he said, can this not sort of demand too much from you and from Germany? Because too much is demanded, too much is expected from you—too great are the expectations, you can't meet them?\nPresident Obama. I'm always optimistic. [Laughter] There are times where I was in the Oval Office and people would come to me with all kinds of political problems and policy problems and international problems, and my team would be getting discouraged and depressed, and I would say to them, I have to be optimistic, because the odds of somebody named Barack Obama being President of the United States were very low, and the fact that, in my lifetime, I have seen such enormous, positive change in the United States and around the world tells me that, although history does not travel in a straight line, it moves in the direction of justice and freedom and a better life for people. But we have to fight for it. We have to work for it.\nWhat makes me cautiously optimistic about my successor and the shift from campaign mode to governance is, there is something about the solemn responsibilities of that office, the extraordinary demands that are placed on the United States—not just by its own people, but by people around the world—that forces you to focus, that demands seriousness. And if you're not serious about the job, then you probably won't be there very long, because it will expose problems. Even when you're doing a good job, even when you are attentive, there are so many things that come across your desk that people are going to question you, and there—you're going to have opponents, and you're going to have critics. And you figure that out pretty fast when you're sitting there. And I think the President-elect is going to see fairly quickly that the demands and responsibilities of a U.S. President are not ones that you can treat casually and that in a big, complex, diverse country, the only way that you can be successful is by listening and reaching out and working with a wide variety of people.\nAnd so it is my hope that that is what will happen. And I'm going to do everything I can over the next 2 months to help assure that that happens.\nIt is absolutely true that Chancellor Merkel is going to have significant responsibilities, has had extraordinary burdens that she's had to carry. If she chooses to continue, you're right, she will have big burdens. I wish I could be there to lighten her load somewhat, but she's tough. [Laughter] And I have—I know what it means to carry burdens because the fact of the matter is, is that if there are problems around the world, the first question people ask is, why isn't Washington doing something about it?\nThis is why it's so important not to discount or take for granted the importance of the transatlantic alliance. And this is probably the best place for me to end.\nIn international fora—in G-20s, in G-7s, in the United Nations—the United States and Germany are not always perfectly aligned. America and Europe are not always perfectly aligned. But the voice that speaks out on behalf of some dissident who is jailed halfway around the world, the voice who is expressing concern about some child in an African village who doesn't have clean drinking water or is subject to some terrible disease, the voice that insists on rules and norms governing international affairs, the voice that helps to steer the world away from war wherever possible—that's our voice more often than not.\nAnd we're not always successful. But if that voice is absent, or if that voice is divided, we will be living in a meaner, harsher, more troubled world. And we have to remember that. And whoever is the U.S. President and whoever is the Chancellor of Germany and whoever is the leader of other European nations and other democracies around the world, they need to recognize that.\nThere are going to be forces that argue for cynicism, for looking the other way with somebody else's problems, that are not going to champion people who are vulnerable, because sometimes that's politically convenient. And if we don't have a strong transatlantic alliance that's standing up for those things, we will be giving to our children a worse world. We will go backwards instead of forwards.\nSo whoever the U.S. President is, whoever the Chancellor of Germany is, we need to remember that. And our citizenry who decide who our Presidents and Chancellors are need to remember that.\nChancellor Merkel. Well, first, it is, after all, a very good thing if, after 8 years of cooperation, the President of the United States says that this is a cooperation based on friendship, that we cooperated well. I feel that this is a very good, a very positive message and, indeed, an encouragement for me.\nNow, secondly, I, fortunately, know very many people—and there are many, many more that I don't know—and many politicians who stand up for the same values of democracy, of liberal societies, of open societies, of respect for the dignity of man. And I feel that we are in a community of people here who stand up for these values, who try to maintain them, and wherever they are not yet respected, stand up for people's rights to enjoy them as well.\nAnd this is worth every effort. And—but I think we're gratified to know that there are many, many people who are—feel committed to this goal.\nThank you very much.", "timestamp": "2016-11-17", "title": "The President's News Conference With Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany in Berlin, Germany"}

Trump", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119657", "text": "(WASHINGTON) - Influential leaders are speaking out in support of U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions upon the announcement that President-elect Donald J. Trump intends to nominate him Attorney General of the United States.\nStatements of support from Senate colleagues, conservative policy groups, and leaders from the legal community came pouring in Friday. Here's what they're saying...\nKenyen R. Brown, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama, President Obama appointee\n\"Jeff Sessions is a man of outstanding character with an impeccable reputation for integrity. I have no doubt that he will be an outstanding U.S. Attorney General. I wish him much success in this new leadership role in our nation.\"\nBarry F. Kowalski, Civil Rights Attorney and Former Special Counsel in the Civil Rights Division of United States Justice Department\n\"I worked closely with Senator Sessions while he was U.S. Attorney and I was in the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department. This was during the 1980s when many southern U.S. Attorneys were not always welcoming to the Civil Rights Division working in their districts. However, Senator Sessions could not have been more supportive of our investigations, and in the Michael Donald case specifically, he personally contributed to making sure his killers were brought to justice.\"\nWilliam Smith, Chief of Staff to Congressman Gary Palmer, Chief Counsel on the Senate Judiciary Committee\n\"I had the opportunity to work with Senators Sessions for close to 10 years. Throughout that time, he was more a friend and confidant than the boss. I believe he hired me as the first-ever Republican African American Chief Counsel on the Senate Judiciary Committee and I'm not sure there has been another one since me. After I moved to Alabama to practice law and then returned to Washington, Senator Sessions offered me the position of Chief Counsel on the full Judiciary Committee and then basically created a position for me on his Senate Budget Committee, where I continued as his Chief. Jeff Sessions is a man of high character and great integrity. He would make an outstanding Attorney General and I'm excited to support him 100%. Although I pushed the envelope a number of times, not once did Senator Sessions ever say anything to offend me. Instead, time after time, he stood by me and the conservative causes I was out to support. I remember spending several late nights in the office, not talking about working, but talking about life and family. Senator Sessions was always concerned for my well-being. Because he is such a great man, one of the most difficult decisions I have ever made was leaving his employment. In his kindness, he told me if I wanted to come back, I could. He, Mary and his children have treated me like family and I'll always be grateful for that.\"\nDr. Darrell Scott, Senior Pastor of New Spirit Revival Center Ministries\n\"I had the opportunity to get to know Sen. Jeff Sessions during President-elect Trump's successful campaign and can say unequivocally that he is a man of great character and integrity. I believe wholeheartedly that he will make an outstanding Attorney General and will ensure that all Americans receive equal justice.\"\nTexas State Representative James White\n\"This summer I had the opportunity to visit extensively with Sen. Jeff Sessions. I am impressed with his command of a host of issues from criminal justice, to national security, to jobs and the economy. His deep and sincere concern for working men and women in America is refreshing.\n\"Over the last two election cycles, I have not drawn a primary or general election opponent. I know firsthand that this occurs because of hard work, not happenstance. When I asked Sen. Sessions how did he managed to accomplish this the last time he was on the ballot in 2014, he told me that he decided a long time ago to \"listen less to the donor class\" and focus more on the people of Alabama. Running unopposed for the U.S. Senate means that Sen. Sessions is not just representing Alabama Republicans or some other specific group, instead he is serving ALL the people of the great State of Alabama; and he renewed my commitment to fight for the people of East Texas.\n\"This is the type of leadership that the American people are clamoring for and I applaud President-elect Trump's decision to nominate Sen. Session as our next Attorney General. As a fellow American, military veteran, conservative Republican elected official, and Southerner, I'm confident that as the attorney general, Jeff Sessions will serve with honor, uphold our Constitution, and exhibit fairness to all Americans.\"\nU.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY)\n\"I strongly support the President-elect's intention to nominate Sen. Jeff Sessions to be the next United States Attorney General. Jeff is principled, forthright, and hardworking. He cares deeply about his country and the Department he will be nominated to lead. As a senator, he has worked tirelessly to safeguard the public and to improve the lives of Americans from all walks of life. Whether it was collaborating with our colleague Sen. Durbin to reduce sentencing disparities for certain drug offenses, teaming up with the late Sen. Ted Kennedy on landmark legislation to combat sexual assault in prison, or his many other achievements, Jeff has always looked out for the safety, security and freedoms of his constituents and the nation.\n\"I look forward to the Senate's fair and expeditious treatment of our colleague's forthcoming nomination, just as it promptly processed President Obama's first Attorney General nomination, which concluded with a timely up or down vote.\"\nU.S. Senate President Pro Tempore Orrin Hatch (R-UT)\n\"The Obama Justice Department veered away from its core mission and too often politicized enforcement of the law. Sen. Sessions has broad law enforcement experience at both the state and the federal levels, and in both the executive and the legislative branches. I am confident he will help get the Justice Department back on track. Having served with Sen. Sessions for many years on the Judiciary Committee, I look forward to supporting his nomination and working closely with him on important initiatives in the months ahead.\"\nU.S. Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee\n\"Sen. Sessions is a respected member and former Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee who has worked across the aisle on major legislation. He knows the Justice Department as a former U.S. attorney, which would serve him very well in this position. With this background, I'm confident he would be reported favorably out of the committee.\"\nLeonard Leo, Executive Vice President, The Federalist Society\n\"I have known Senator Jeff Sessions for nearly a quarter century and I can say emphatically that President Trump is picking a very good man for Attorney General. He has the independence, integrity, experience and commitment to human dignity that is so important in an Attorney General or any public servant charged with upholding the Constitution.\"\nU.S. Senator Susan Collins (R. Maine)\n\"He is an individual who works hard, believes in public service and acts with integrity. As a former U.S. attorney and former Alabama attorney general, Senator Sessions is well qualified and would serve our country well as United States Attorney General.\"\nU.S. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC)\n\"Sen. Sessions is a fine, decent man and principled conservative. I've known him for more than twenty years. He has the experience and ability to serve as Attorney General of the United States. He was an early supporter of Donald Trump in the Senate and he has earned the right to serve President-elect Trump and our nation at the highest level.\"\nU.S. Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ)\n\"Senator Sessions is well liked and well regarded, even by those who don't always agree with him. I look forward to supporting his nomination.\"\nU.S. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX)\n\"Sen. Jeff Sessions' nomination as attorney general is great news for all of us who revere the Constitution and the rule of law. I have been honored to work with Sen. Sessions on many of our nation's most important issues over the last four years. Sen. Sessions has had an extraordinary career in government and law enforcement. He has been an exemplary senator for the state of Alabama, and I am confident that he will be an exceptional United States attorney general.\"\nU.S. Senator Richard Shelby (R-AL)\n\"President-elect Trump has made an outstanding decision in selecting my friend and colleague Sen. Jeff Sessions to serve as our next U.S. Attorney General. Jeff is a man of integrity who has been a trusted and valued partner of mine in the Senate as well as an unwavering voice for Alabamians in Congress. With decades of experience in the legal field and an impressive tenure on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Jeff will bring expertise to President-elect Trump's cabinet and the Department of Justice.\n\"I am confident that Jeff will continue to stand up for the American people, our Constitution, and the rule of law in this new role. My wife Annette and I wish him, his wife Mary, and his family the very best during this exciting time.\"\nU.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX)\n\"I commend the choice of Sen. Sessions to lead the Justice Department under the new Republican Administration. A principled and good man, he will restore honor to a Department that, under President Obama, perpetually pushed a political agenda while neglecting to enforce the law. For nearly eight years the Justice Department has twisted the Constitution and the laws passed by Congress to further the President's liberal agenda, eroding our liberty in the process. It has put politics ahead of national security, and demonized those who protect us. It's time to end the politicization of the Justice Department and start defending the rule of law, and I'm confident that as our top law enforcement official Senator Sessions will do that.\"\nU.S. Senator Roger Wicker (R-MS)\n\"Sen. Jeff Sessions will be a champion for the Constitution and the rule of law. He will also provide sound counsel to President-elect Trump during the selection of Supreme Court nominees and other judicial appointments. For the past eight years, the Justice Department has eroded our nation's immigration laws, attacked our Second Amendment rights, and weakened religious liberty. It has been more concerned with pushing politics than administering the law. If confirmed, I am confident that Sen. Sessions can reverse that tide and help restore people's faith in their government.\nU.S. Senator Dan Sullivan (R-AK)\n\"I am encouraged to hear about President-elect Trump's nomination of my Senate colleague Sen. Jeff Sessions to be the next Attorney General of the United States. Sen. Sessions has a long record of exemplary public service, and is a passionate defender of our Constitution and the rule of law. I look forward to his confirmation and working with the next Attorney General in reestablishing constitutional principles that have been eviscerated by the current Administration.\"\nU.S. Senator David Perdue (R-GA)\n\"Jeff's extensive legal career and experience make him a natural fit to lead our nation's Justice Department. His knowledge and dedication to our judicial system have been evident during my work with him on the Senate Judiciary Committee. I look forward to continue working with Jeff to make our country safer for all Americans.\"\nU.S. Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC)\n\"Over the last two years, I've had the pleasure of calling Sen. Sessions my friend and colleague. While Sen. Sessions and I certainly don't agree on the specifics of every major issue, including immigration reform and criminal justice reform, he always expresses our policy differences in the form of productive and gracious exchanges of ideas. From my experience working with him on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, I consider him to be hands-down one of the fairest and most accessible chairmen of any congressional committee.\n\"These are some of the reasons Sen. Sessions is so well-liked by his colleagues, and respected by leaders of both parties. As Attorney General, he will follow the rule of law, be accessible, and address the organizational and accountability issues plaguing the Department of Justice, which are qualities and priorities that have unfortunately been missing from the department's leadership over the last eight years.\"\nU.S. Senator Mike Lee (R-UT)\n\"Sen. Sessions' solid understanding of the Constitution and firm commitment to the rule of law is exactly what the Justice Department needs. I have worked closely with Sen. Sessions on the Judiciary Committee over these past six years and I have every confidence that he will make a great Attorney General for all Americans.\"\nU.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-OK)\n\"I am pleased that President-elect Trump has announced his intention to nominate my good friend and colleague Jeff Sessions as attorney general. Sen. Sessions and I have worked closely together in the Senate for the last 20 years on the Armed Services and Environment & Public Works Committees. He is well respected on both sides of the aisle, in his home state of Alabama, and across the country. Sen. Session's experience as well as his deep respect for the rule of law leave no doubt in my mind that he is an excellent pick for attorney general.\"\nU.S. Senator John Barrasso (R-WY)\n\"For nine years, I have had the pleasure of working with Jeff Sessions in the Senate. He is well-respected by his colleagues and is unfailingly gracious to everyone. Jeff has been a strong advocate for our men and women in uniform, and for our nation's safety and security. He has also shown a willingness to listen to and work with senators on both sides of the aisle. I support his nomination to be the next Attorney General, and I look forward to his timely and fair hearing in the Senate.\"\nJim DeMint, former U.S. Senator and President of the Heritage Foundation\n\"No one will work harder than Jeff Sessions to defend the freedoms and safety of all Americans as Attorney General. He is not intimidated by the liberal media or the Washington establishment. He has the courage and the proven record to take on special interests. He is passionate about defending the Constitution and the rule of law to protect the rights of everyone. Jeff has been such a great friend to me and many others, becoming one of the most respected leaders in the Senate and should easily be confirmed.\"\nFormer Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee\n\"Jeff Sessions great pick for AG. He was a bold voice to stop TPP when other GOP figures were ready to give away the country.\"\nPublic Interest Legal Foundation\n\"Sen. Sessions' record and respect for the rule of law makes him an excellent choice to lead the United States Department of Justice,\" said J. Christian Adams, President of the Public Interest Legal Foundation and former lawyer in the Voting Rights Section of the Department. \"Over the past 8 years, the Department of Justice has been derelict on its responsibilities to ensure free and fair elections across this nation, at times even contributing to the problem. We look forward to working with the Department to restore election integrity nationwide.\"\nNational Sheriffs' Association\n\"Sen. Sessions would be an outstanding nominee for U.S. Attorney General. Sen. Sessions has enormous integrity, fidelity to the rule of law, substantial experience and a commitment to fairness and equal justice under the law. Those are qualities America needs as its chief law enforcement officer to the Federal Government.\n\"Throughout his career, Sen. Sessions has steadfastly supported the men and women who risk their lives every day to preserve the rule of law. Sen. Sessions is an experienced prosecutor with a world-class legal mind, serving as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama, Alabama Attorney General and for two decades on the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, which oversees the Department of Justice.\n\"Sen. Sessions would be an extraordinary Attorney General and we're hopeful the new administration nominates him and the U.S. Senate quickly confirms.\"\nAmericans for Limited Government\n\"President-elect Donald Trump has made a strong statement that our Justice Department will return to following the rule of law through his appointment of Sen. Jeff Sessions to serve as the Attorney General. While soft-spoken, Sen. Sessions has the steel-willed determination to restore DOJ from its current corrupted partisanship by putting the blindfold back on Lady Justice as he enforces the law. Sessions will also help remove the stain of an Obama Justice Department that views itself more as political activists than neutral arbiters as has been witnessed by their legal war on local police and their failure to enforce immigration laws. The only potential down-side of Sen. Jeff Sessions' appointment is that when confirmed, the Senate will lose one of its great leaders who has met every challenge with integrity and quiet strength.\"\nSusan B. Anthony List (SBA List) president Marjorie Dannenfelser\n\"Sen. Jeff Sessions is a longtime ally of the pro-life movement with a 100 percent pro-life record. We look forward to working with him and supporting him as he enforces current and future pro-life laws, including those President-elect Trump has pledged to advance. A pro-life Attorney General will be a welcome change. The Obama Administration has consistently turned a blind eye to the abortion industry, led by Planned Parenthood, and their horrific involvement in the trafficking of baby body organs.\"\nPenny Nance, CEO & President of Concerned Women for America (CWA)\n\"Sen. Sessions has been a champion for the conservative principles that are the foundation of liberty and freedom. Both his academic preparation and his stellar career as a U.S. Attorney and as a senator testify of an honest, competent man with a heart towards serving his fellow countrymen, even through much personal sacrifice. We commend President-elect Trump for his selection of such a strong candidate. The choice speaks very highly of his commitment to conservative principles.\n\"The hundreds of thousands of members of Concerned Women for America (CWA) around the country will urge senators to move quickly in the new year to confirm Sen. Sessions as the next attorney general, so that we may start rectifying many of the asphyxiating policies pursued by Attorney General Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch. The attacks on religious freedom and freedom of conscience in general, for example, must be at the top of the list.\"", "timestamp": "2016-11-18", "title": "Press Release - What They Are Saying: President-elect Donald J.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122589", "text": "Through President Obama's Clean Energy Savings for All Initiative and beyond, we are making progress opening up opportunities for all American's to go solar and retrofit their homes and businesses to be more energy efficient. Since President Obama took office, the amount of electricity we generate from the sun has increased more than 30 fold, we added solar jobs 12 times faster than the rest of the economy, and we've cut the price of residential solar energy systems more than 50 percent. In fact, earlier this week the U.S. Department of Energy's SunShot program announced a new target to cut the cost of solar in half by 2030. At the same time, energy consumption in 2015 was 1.5 percent lower than it was in 2008, while the economy grew by 10 percent over the same period. And we have improved the energy efficiency of more than one million low and moderate income homes.\nToday, in coordination with a White House Clean Energy Savings for All Summit in Baltimore, Maryland hosted by Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz and Labor Secretary Tom Perez, the Obama Administration is taking the following new actions:\nLaunching a Challenge to Bring Solar Energy to Dozens of Low and Moderate Income Communities: The U.S. Department of Energy's SunShot Initiative is launching a new Solar In Your Community challenge to expand solar access to Americans who have been left out of the growing solar market, including low- and moderate-income (LMI) households, state, local and tribal governments, and non-profit organizations. One hundred teams across the country will compete for cash prizes and technical assistance as they demonstrate innovative business and financial models that expand solar access to underserved groups. The teams with the most scalable, replicable solar business models will be eligible to win $1 million in final prizes, including a $500,000 grand prize. This challenge will reduce market barriers to solar deployment by spurring dozens of projects across the nation, with an emphasis on new and emerging solar markets. The challenge will help to achieve President Obama's goal to bring 1 gigawatt (GW) of solar to low and moderate income families by 2020, test new business models that expand solar access, build local capacity to support community-scale solar projects, and establish resources that will aid in expanding solar access to underserved communities.\nGrowing the Reach And Impact of the Obama Administration's National Community Solar Partnership: Last July, the Administration launched the National Community Solar Partnership—a collaborative effort between DOE, HUD, USDA, EPA, representatives from solar companies, NGOs, and state and community leaders —which works to unlock access to solar for the nearly 50 percent of households and businesses that are renters or do not have adequate roof space to install solar systems, in particular, for low- and moderate- income communities. Since we launched the partnership last year, more than 150 companies, organizations, and universities that represent 36 states have joined the effort to increase access to community solar, growing the number of members to 155, including the following 27 new partners joining today:\n•      C2 Special Situations Group - New York\n•      Center for Sustainable Communities - Georgia\n•      Clean Energy States Alliance - Vermont\n•      Connexus Energy - Minnesota\n•      Elemental Energy, Inc. - Oregon\n•      Energy Alabama - Alabama\n•      Energy Outreach Colorado - Colorado\n•      Energy Solidarity Cooperative - California\n•      Environment Georgia - Georgia\n•      Great Plains Institute - Minnesota\n•      ICAST - Colorado\n•      Imani Energy, Inc. - Delaware\n•      Metropolitan Area Planning Council - Massachusetts\n•      Minnesota Department of Commerce - Minnesota\n•      MN Community Solar - Minnesota\n•      Monadnock Sustainability Network – New Hampshire\n•      Nebraskans for Solar - Nebraska\n•      North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center – North Carolina\n•      Novel Energy Solutions - Minnesota\n•      Placer Consulting Services LLC - Tennessee\n•      Reneu Energy – New York\n•      Rhode Island Office of Energy Resources – Rhode Island\n•      Rural Communities Housing Development Corporation - California\n•      Solar Site Design - Tennessee\n•      Sunvestment Group, LLC – New York\n•      Tralee Capital Partners - Colorado\n•      West Virginia Solar Systems – West Virginia\nIssuing Best Practices for Promoting the Development of Smart Residential PACE Financing Programs that ProtectConsumers: Today, DOE is releasing updated Best Practice Guidelines for Residential PACE Financing Programs. The guidelines provide best practices that can help state and local governments, PACE program administrators, and their partners to plan and implement programs that effectively deliver clean energy, water efficiency, and related upgrades to consumers. The updated best practices reflect input gained from over 200 comments on draft guidelines released for public review earlier this summer. The new guidelines include additional protections for consumers who voluntarily opt into PACE programs and lenders who hold mortgages on properties with PACE assessments. DOE also provides additional guidelines and program design recommendations to help ensure PACE financing is used appropriately and at the lowest cost for low-income households that otherwise meet program eligibility criteria. DOE will continue supporting state and local governments in incorporating the guidelines into PACE statutes and regulations as they are developed and modified. Additional information about PACE financing and technical assistance available at DOE can be found at their State and Local Solution Center. The best practices build on the PACE financing guidance issued by the Federal Housing Administration and Department of Veterans Affairs this summer.\nAnnouncing a New Partnership to Help Improve Energy Efficiency in HUD-Assisted and Public Housing: This summer, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development began partnering with EDF Climate Corps fellows to promote utility benchmarking of HUD-Assisted and Public Housing. The fellows will be embedded with organizations across the country to offer assistance in analyzing and documenting portfolio-wide energy usage and developing strategies to improve energy performance and reduce operating costs.\nCreating a Clean Energy Compact between the Department of Energy and Historically Black Colleges and Universities to Forge a Workforce and Community Investment Program: As the energy industry continues to transform, the U.S. Department of Energy is working with Historically Black Colleges and Universities to establish the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Clean Energy Coalition (HBCU-CEC). The goal is to strategically engage the nation's HBCUs in the adoption of energy efficiency, solar and other renewable energies on campus and within the communities where HBCUs are located, primarily populated by low and moderate income individuals and families. Collectively, the coalition, with technical assistance from the Department of Energy, led by the Energy Jobs Strategy Council and the Office of Economic Impact and Diversity, will forge a workforce and community investment program focusing on energy education and awareness, low and moderate income solar deployment, building energy efficiency, job creation, jobs skills training, utility costs savings, and reduction in environmental impacts. These efforts will help to position HBCUs as demonstrated leaders in deploying clean energy in low and moderate income communities while insuring the community benefits from resultant economic and social opportunities.", "timestamp": "2016-11-18", "title": "Fact Sheet: Obama Administration Announces New Actions to Bring Clean Energy Savings to All Americans"}

Today, I can announce that the United States will join the global initiative in which these industries, governments and civil society, all work together for greater transparency so that taxpayers receive every dollar they're due from the extraction of natural resources.\"\n–President Obama, September 20, 2011, at the launch of the Open Government Partnership in New York\nThe  Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) has set a global standard designed to help promote the open and accountable management of extractive industry resources. With 51 countries implementing the standard, including the United States, the EITI is working to strengthen citizens' understanding of their country's oil, gas, and mining sectors by promoting the disclosure of extractive industry revenues paid by companies and received by governments. By increasing transparency and accountability in the extractives sector, the EITI is helping countries to improve governance, attract investment, and combat corruption and mismanagement so that citizens benefit from their country's natural resources. As one of the first global multi-stakeholder initiatives, the EITI has robust participation from governments, companies, and civil society from each EITI implementing country.\nThe United States has long supported the mission of EITI, including by sitting on its international Board and by making financial contributions to support EITI implementation around the world. These global efforts include:\n•      Promotion and support of EITI as a key component of U.S. foreign policy efforts to combat corruption and advance transparency, especially as it includes and impacts the extractive industry. Through the State Department, the United States has strongly supported EITI since its inception in 2002 and played a key role in shaping it into a global standard. Through State Department representation on the EITI Board and committees, the United States has worked to expand EITI participation, maintain and adapt the EITI Standard to keep pace with changing global norms, and ensure robust review and compliance mechanisms for countries seeking EITI validation.\n•      Bolstering recognition of EITI in multilateral fora including the G-7 and the G-20. U.S. engagement also inspired others, including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Mexico, and Australia to implement the EITI. The U.S. decision to join EITI advanced the mainstreaming of EITI principles and has demonstrated that a strong commitment to transparency and accountability principles applies equally to developed and developing countries.\n•      Support to the multilateral World Bank-managed EITI Donor Trust Fund, including $13.5 million in funding to support technical assistance and grants to strengthen national EITI secretariats, which are critically important to coordinating EITI implementation at the country level.\n•      Targeted, country-led bilateral support for EITI implementation through USAID Missions, including $14.5 million to support EITI candidacy, implementation, and civil society outreach. U.S. bilateral assistance has led to notable results, with activities in a diverse array of countries ranging from training country EITI multi-stakeholder groups (MSGs), to supporting civil society organizations advocacy and participation, to working with indigenous groups to reduce conflict over extractives.\n•      Pioneering efforts to measure and maintain the impacts of EITI through $2.8 million in international civil society organization support, research, and peer learning and exchange activities.\nIn addition to its global benefits, the Obama Administration believes that the EITI can make a valuable contribution to citizen understanding of the extractives industry here in the United States. The data disclosed through the EITI highlights the value of industry contributions to the U.S. government and helps ensure the full and fair return to the American people for the use of its public resources.\nSince President Obama announced in 2011 that the United States would also implement the EITI domestically, the United States has:\n•      Formed a Federal Advisory Committee comprised of company, civil society, and state and federal government representatives who advise the Secretary of the Interior on how the federal government can improve the transparency of the U.S. extractives industry through the EITI.\n•      Released twoU.S. Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (USEITI) Reportswith comprehensive data regarding production of energy and hard minerals and associated revenues on federal land nationwide, including data on U.S. wind, solar, and geothermal projects.\n•      Launched, through the Department of Interior, a groundbreaking interactive data portal that makes it easier for citizens to understand and utilize data about extractive industries in their communities. For the design of the new U.S. EITI portal, the Department of Interior worked with 18F, the digital service delivery team at the U.S. General Services Administration. The portal offers visualizations of extractives data to show how such resources generate revenue across the country, and where the money earned goes to benefit local communities in all 50 states and U.S. territories. The integrated single-window access now showcases enriched data and information like the  Abandoned Mine Lands Program and the robust financial  audit and assurance practices to improve the public's understanding of our management and stewardship of vast natural resources owned by every American. Not only does this information makes us more accountable to the American people, but on a global scale our user-centered design approach and commitment to open data and open source code internationally recognized as exemplary best practice in reporting revenue data.\n•      Secured the voluntary participation of three major U.S. natural resource-producing states—Alaska, Montana and  Wyoming—to participate in the USEITI process. Further engagement incorporated the voluntary participation of indigenous tribes, including Blackfeet Nation, Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho Tribes, and Choctaw Nation. This collaboration with states and indigenous tribes expands public access to local-level natural resource data on revenues, distribution of those revenues, and legal and fiscal governance of the extractive industries, as well as the economic impact of extraction in their states and territories.", "timestamp": "2016-11-18", "title": "Fact Sheet: The United States' Commitment to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative"}

With pride, passion, and a commitment to their loved ones, family members give of themselves to create opportunities they never had and forge a brighter future for themselves and their children. This week, we honor the families who have built the America we know today and reaffirm our commitment to ensuring every family can have their chance at a fair shot.\nNobody should have to choose between spending time with their family and financially supporting them, and my Administration has prioritized efforts to strengthen families and address the challenges we face in our workforce. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, the uninsured rate has never been lower, and more families have been able to get quality, affordable health care. But there is more work to be done. The United States is the only advanced country that does not guarantee paid family or sick leave, and too often, American workers have to make painful choices about whether they can afford to be there when their families need them most. Workers also deserve fair work schedules that ensure predictability and certainty. And women should be paid the same as men for doing the same jobs—a principle that is not just fair and ethical, but also necessary because more women are their family's main breadwinners than ever before.\nWe all have a role to play in lifting up families, and the Federal Government is leading by example. To help give more families the comfort of safe and nurturing child care, my Administration published a new rule earlier this year to strengthen quality, health, and safety standards for child care programs. Earlier this year, I took action to expand overtime protections to more than 4 million workers, and because no one who works full time should have to raise their family in poverty, I have called on the Congress to raise the Federal minimum wage—in the meantime, cities, States, and businesses across our country have taken action, answering the call to raise the minimum wage and helping American families everywhere.\nFamilies of every race, religion, and background have written America's story and embodied our founding notion: that out of many, we are one. Adoptive and foster families open their hearts and their homes to welcome children in need, patriotic military families sacrifice precious time with their loved ones to give us the opportunity to be with ours, and last year, the families of gay and lesbian couples who fought so long for basic civil rights were finally recognized as equal under the law.\nThrough challenging moments and difficult times, America's families are representative of the strength and unity at the core of our communities. Their love is an enduring reminder of what is best about our country. This week, let us celebrate the devotion of dedicated family members across our Nation and pledge to give them the support they need to thrive.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 20 through November 26, 2016, as National Family Week. I invite all States, communities, and individuals to join in observing this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities to honor our Nation's families.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-11-18", "title": "Proclamation 9544—National Family Week, 2016"}

From ensuring they are cared for and nourished to helping them become educated participants in our democracy, we must all do our part to support the next generation of leaders. Today, let us lift up every child in need and strive to leave behind a world that we are proud of for children across our country.\nMy Administration has worked to put children in every community on a path to a healthier future. Through First Lady Michelle Obama's Let's Move! initiative, we have fostered environments that support healthy choices, promote physical activity, and reduce childhood obesity. We have also fought to improve Head Start and expand quality, affordable child care, which promotes healthy development and school readiness in young children and helps families be more financially secure at home. Because of the broader coverage expansions made possible by the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and improvements made to the Children's Health Insurance Plan through legislation I signed during my first month in office, more than 3 million children have gotten health insurance and the uninsured rate among children has fallen by almost half since 2008. And because of the ACA, children can no longer be denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition. They can also remain on a parent's health insurance plan until age 26, and all plans on the Health Insurance Marketplace are now required to cover basic pediatric services. Anyone who is in need of health insurance can visit www.HealthCare.gov to find coverage for themselves and their children.

Not only must we protect our planet against climate change and secure it for future generations, but we must continue taking concrete action to reduce the effects that dirty air and water can impose on our children—such as the potential for higher incidence of asthma attacks. We must also work to keep our children safe from violence and abuse, prevent youth substance use and its consequences, and modernize our juvenile justice system to hold youth accountable for their actions without consigning them to a never-ending cycle of incarceration.\nWe know that when we invest in young children, the outcomes are significant—and by investing in early education and preschool for all, we can set children up for success later in life. Education has the potential to unlock ladders of opportunity and empower children to pursue their passions, and we must continue working to strengthen our Nation's education system for children at every grade level. That is why my Administration has pursued efforts to bring higher education within reach for more students and make college more affordable.\nOur journey is not complete until all our children are cared for, cherished, and safe from harm. On National Child's Day, let us forge a future of greater opportunity and prosperity for every young person, and let us seek to reach our greatest potential as a Nation by ensuring our daughters and sons can live up to theirs. Now, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 20, 2016, as National Child's Day. I call upon all citizens to observe this day with appropriate activities, programs, and ceremonies, and to rededicate ourselves to creating the bright future we want for our Nation's children.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-11-18", "title": "Proclamation 9545—National Child's Day, 2016"}

Hola, Peru! Asu! Muchas gracias. Thank you so much. Thank you. Everybody, please have a seat. [Laughter] Thank you, Cyntia, for your kind words and your great work here in Peru in bringing people together across generations to meet challenges. Please give Cyntia a big round of applause for the great introduction.\nSo it is wonderful to be here in Peru. I want to thank everybody at Catholic University of Peru for hosting us. I want to thank the Government and the people of this beautiful country for your hospitality.\nAudience member. I love you!\nThe President. I love you too. I do.\nSo, while I'm here, I'm hoping to enjoy some good food: some pollo a la brasa, maybe a pisco sour. But I will not be attempting the Marinera, because I usually leave the dancing to my wife Michelle. [Laughter] She's a better dancer than me.\nBut I want to thank all of you for being here, our Young Leaders of America, both live and online, representing every country in Latin America and the Caribbean.\nNow, this is my final stop on my final trip abroad as President of the United States. And I've had the usual meetings with world leaders, and we've done important business. But whenever I travel, one of the things I've been trying to do for the last 8 years is to meet with young people. First of all, young people are more fun than old people. [Laughter] Second, because today, more than half of the world's population is 30 or younger. And that means your generation will determine the course of our future, as individual nations and as a global community. Now, the good news is, because I've had a chance to meet so many young people around the world, it makes me very optimistic to know that you are going to be in charge. And that's why I wanted my last public event abroad to be with you.\nI often say to young people in my own country: If you had to be born at any time in human history, it would be right now. If you think about all the progress that's been made, not just in your lifetimes, but even in the last few years, fewer people than ever around the world live in extreme poverty. Scientific breakthroughs are paving the way for cures to new diseases. More children are going to school—more girls in particular are going to school—than ever before. People across the world are securing their human rights. And technology has reshaped the world, as you can tell, because everybody has their phones. [Laughter] At a time when Earth is now populated by more cell phones than people—[laughter]—you have the power to connect with each other across borders, across nations. You have the tools in your hand to solve problems that we couldn't even imagine when I was your age.\nNow, even as we make all these important strides in advancing the rights of more people, even as technology brings us closer together, this unprecedented change also brings challenges. We see it in the widening gap between rich and poor around the world. We see it in the forces of extremism and division that too often tear communities apart. So the question for all of us is, how can we make sure that in this rapidly changing world, nobody is left behind and that all of us are stronger and more prosperous?\nSo, over the last 8 years as President, I've worked to strengthen our relationship with the Americas. We're more than just neighbors. We're linked by trade and culture and family and values. Our students study in each other's countries. Our businesses sell goods across borders. Our tourists travel back and forth. And we've moved beyond many of the old arguments to create a new vision for the future, one that your generation, which is liberated from old ways of thinking, can lead.\nDuring my Presidency, the United States recommitted itself to the region, in partnership with your countries, based on mutual interests and mutual respect. We increased trade. We stood up for democracy and human rights, fought against corruption and organized crime. We've promoted clean energy. We've led the global fight against climate change. We opened a new relationship with Cuba.\nI strongly believe that this work has to be done with governments, but it's even more important that it's done by people, because government is important, but it can't solve every problem. So we have to work together at a people-to-people level: teachers and doctors and students and entrepreneurs and religious leaders, all trying to find ways in which we can promote those values of dignity and humanity and respect that so often are threatened.\nAnd that's why we developed this Young Leaders Initiative. Our goal is to find the most innovative young entrepreneurs, the most energetic civil society leaders like you, and help empower you with training and tools and connections so you can make a difference in your communities and your countries. This network already has 20,000 people. This fall, we welcomed the first class of 250 YLAI Fellows to the United States. [Applause] Yes! This is just a hundred of them. [Laughter] They're from every country across the Americas.\nWe want to help—[applause]—so we want to help this generation with grants, seed funding, skills training. Today I'm announcing the launch of the Latin American and Caribbean Civil Society Innovation Initiative Hub, which is a way to virtually connect civil society organizations across the region so you can learn from each other, share your good work, support each other. We're investing $40 million in the talents and entrepreneurship of young people across the Caribbean to help start your own businesses and ventures. We're opening what we call the Global Innovation Exchange so that you can showcase your new business or enterprise to people around the world, and that way, you can connect and, hopefully, get resources that you otherwise didn't have.\nAnd we're moving ahead with more educational partnerships, like the 100,000 Strong in the Americas. By the end of the decade, we want 100,000 U.S. students studying in the Americas and 100,000 students from the Americas studying in the United States. And today we're announcing a partnership between the U.S. Department of State, Sempra, and CAF, which is Latin America's development bank, to fund the first innovation fund competition exclusively between Peruvian and U.S. colleges and universities so students can come together to work on climate change and environmental science.\nSo we're focused on the hemisphere; we're focused on the region. But it's more than just North America, South America. You're now part of a global network of young leaders from Africa, Southeast Asia, Europe, and the Americas who are doing amazing work in their own communities. And while my time as U.S. President is coming to an end, this network is just beginning. It's never been more important. We need you to stay connected, work together, learn from each other, so we can build that next generation of leadership who can take on challenges like climate change and poverty, can help grow our economies, make sure that women get opportunity; make sure that every child, wherever they live, has a chance to build a good life.\nAnd I'm going to just give you some examples of the amazing people that are involved in this process. We need leaders like Dr. Valéry Moise. As a young doctor in Haiti, Valéry saw firsthand how issues like acute malnutrition—hunger—affected the poorest children in her country—in his country. So he and a team of social workers and doctors started an organization called Diagnostik Group, which focuses on improving health care for abandoned children at the largest pediatric hospital in Haiti. His goal is for the group to become the standard for pediatric care and to expand so that he can reach even more children across Haiti. So thank you, Valéry, for the great work that you are doing. [Applause] Thank you.\nWe need leaders like Abbigale Loncke of Guyana. Abbigale, are you here? So after struggling to find her own grandfather home care, Abbigale realized this is a problem for so many other families, so she started Community Health Care, a home care agency. She started out as a service to help families take care of their loved ones, but now has a social movement that also provides training and job opportunities for young women in the health care industry. So thank you, Abbigale, for the great work you're doing. And you already heard the great work that Cyntia is doing right here in Peru.\nAcross the world and across the Americas, young people are taking the lead. They're seeing problems, they're seeing injustice, and they are finding ways to take action.\nAnd the main message I want you to know is that you have a partner in me and you have a partner in the United States Government. And we are going to work together. We expect the fellowships to continue, but I want you to know that I will also continue to be involved, even after I'm President, because I want to make sure that we continue to invest in your success. If you succeed, not only do your countries succeed, but the world succeeds. And I'm very excited to see all the great things you're going to do in the future.\nSo muchas gracias. Let's take some questions. Now we're going to start with some questions. I'm going to take off my jacket because it's a little hot. [Laughter] The—so I wasn't trying to get a cheer out of that, but—[laughter].\nThe—hey, I'm—can somebody just grab this? Thank you. Thank you, Mike. All right, so we're going to start with this question from this gentleman right here. Please introduce yourself as you speak.\nHold on, the mike is not working. No, not yet. [Laughter] Do we have a second mike yet? Testing, one, two, three. Hold on, here's the technical expert. [Laughter] Here we go. Here's another one. Not yet? Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Here we go, we're going to try this one. [Laughter] One of these is going to work.\nQ. Testing, testing\nThe President. Oh, there you go. Hey!\nDemocracy\nQ. Finally. Good afternoon, Mr. President. My name is Luis Santiago. I'm from Caracas, Venezuela. I'm a YLAI Fellow. We're working on the first electronic health records platform for Latin America, and I was a proud member of this cohort of YLAI Fellows. I'm here to read a question from our YLAI network. There were 200 questions posted on Facebook, but Carlos David Carrasco Muro from Venezuela asks: \"In Venezuela, there's a debate about what matters most for stability, whether it's peace or democracy. How can we create a world where do not—we do not have to choose between them? Both are important for development.\"\nThank you very much.\nThe President. Well, it's a great question. And it's a timely question, because I think that after a decade in which we've seen more and more countries adopt democratic practices, you're now starting to see some of those gains reversed. You're seeing some countries that are going backwards rather than forwards in terms of freedom of the press, in terms of freedom of the Internet, in terms of respecting political opposition and civil society. And there are those who argue that democracy is incompatible with development because you need order, you need somebody from the top to tell people what to do in order to achieve.\nAnd I would just suggest that you look at the evidence over the last 20, 30, 40 years. Those countries that pursue democracy, that pursue transparency, where their leaders are held accountable, those are the countries that are doing best. Those countries that are repressive, that don't respect democracy, that silence critics, they go backwards economically.\nAnd it makes sense when you think about it, because in this time that we live in, development is based on knowledge and innovation and education and new thinking and sharing of ideas. It's not based on how much land you have, it's not based on natural resources. It's based on your people. And in a democracy, what we're able to do is, people, through the freedom they enjoy, are able to create, start businesses, start organizations, solve problems. And what's also true then is, they're able to hold the government accountable, so when the government doesn't deliver for its people—if it engages in corruption, if its policies only benefit a few rather than the many—people can react and respond, and over time, people get better policies from their governments.\nAnd look at what's happened just along the coast here in Latin America. You look at Chile, Peru, Colombia, all of them are growing faster, all of them are doing better because of the new openness and democracy that exists in these countries. And what's true here is true around the world.\nNow, the one thing I have to say though is, democracy is more than just elections. Democracy is also a free press. Democracy is also freedom of religion. Democracy is making sure that the rights of minorities are protected, not just the majority. Democracy is rule of law and an independent judiciary. So it's a matter of all these elements coming together.\nBut the main thing we've learned is that, in this knowledge-based society, you can maintain order for a while with repressive, nondemocratic governments, but it will rot from within. Over time, those governments fail and those economies fail, because when they make mistakes, they try to hide them instead of trying to solve them. When somebody has a legitimate criticism of a problem, it can be ignored because the politicians don't have to answer. And eventually, those societies end up doing much worse, oftentimes by increasing repression as people get more and more dissatisfied, and then society breaks down.\nIt's also true, by the way, that nondemocratic countries are much more likely to get into wars with other nondemocratic countries. Democracies tend to try to solve problems through diplomacy and dialogue. So not only is there not a contradiction between democracy and development, it is my belief that in order, in this new knowledge-based economy, for development to be successful, you need democracy.\nI will say this one last thing, though. Democracy can be frustrating, because democracy means that you don't always get a hundred percent of what you want. Democracy means that sometimes you have to compromise. And it means that the outcomes of elections don't always turn out the way you would hope. [Laughter] And then, you—we're going through that in the United States, and I'm doing everything I can to help facilitate a successful transition with the President-elect in the United States. But as long as we keep our democratic systems open, then the society has a chance to try something new, and then it can make a decision and correct problems that they see in the future, and progress will continue. Okay?\nGood. All right. Let's see, right there. Yes, you. Yes. So let's get a microphone to you so we can hear you. And introduce yourself. By the way, I apologize, my Spanish is just okay. [Laughter] So we're doing this in English, but hopefully, I'm being clear. Go ahead.\nPresident-Elect Donald J. Trump/North Atlantic Treaty Organization/Latin America-U.S. Relations/Trade\nQ. Hi, Mr. President. I'm very glad to be here—that you are here in my country, in Peru.\nThe President. Yes.\nQ. And for me, it's an honor to be here in this conference. Well, my question is, what do you think about that European Union having been come together to promote military integration in defense that—after the victory of Trump? And do you think that it is—we have a global paranoia created by the media, or is it real?\nThe President. Good. What's your name?\nQ. Jocelyn Ramirez.\nThe President. Nice to meet you. The—are you a student here?\nQ. I'm a student from UPC. [Applause]\nThe President. Fantastic. Okay. You have some classmates here. [Laughter]\nThe—well, the United States is such a big country that, after any election, people are uncertain. And I think it will be important for everybody around the world to not make immediate judgments, but give this new President-elect a chance to put their team together, to examine the issues, to determine what their policies will be. Because as I've always said, how you campaign isn't always the same as how you govern. Sometimes, when you're campaigning, you're trying to stir up passions. When you govern, you actually have reality in front of you, and you have to figure out, how do I make this work?\nThe alliance between the United States and Europe, through NATO, is very strong. And the President-elect Trump has already reaffirmed our commitment to NATO. We actually have been asking, under my administration, for Europe to carry more of the burden of defense spending than they've been doing, because the United States spends a lot more than some of our NATO partners. And they recognize and acknowledge, I think, the need for them to spend more time—more resources on that.\nWith respect to Latin America, I don't anticipate major changes in policy from the new administration. I think the work that we've done has been successful in establishing the strongest relationships between the United States and Latin America in modern history. The friendships that we've established with countries like Peru, the reopening of diplomatic relations with Cuba, the investments we're making in trade, in environmental policy, and so forth, all those things I expect to continue.\nThere are going to be tensions that arise, probably around trade more than anything else, because the President-elect campaigned on a—looking at every trade policy and potentially reversing some of those policies. But once they look at how it's working, I think they'll determine that it's actually good both for the United States and our trading partners. There may need to be modifications. I've called for modifications in certain elements of our trading policy. When we established the U.S.-Peru Free Trade Agreement, one of the requirements was for Peru to strengthen its protection of labor rights, workers' rights. And we did that in part because, with all of our trading partners we don't want to be disadvantaged because we're dealing with labor that has no rights and so gets the lowest wages and can be exploited. But we did it also because that will help lift the wages and benefits and protections that workers here in Peru enjoy, because ultimately, that's good for everybody.\nOne of the things I really believe is that when you pay workers well, when ordinary people are getting a decent wage and decent benefits and decent protections, then they have more money in their pockets, and then they go out and they spend that money, which is good for business, and everybody is better off. So that's the kind of attitude that we want to try to promote in the years going forward. And my hope is, is that that policy will continue.\nSo my main message to you, though—and the message I delivered in Europe is—don't just assume the worst. Wait until the administration is in place, it's actually putting its policies together, and then you can make your judgments as to whether or not it's consistent with the international community's interest in living in peace and prosperity together. Okay?\nGood. All right. Okay, so what I'm doing is, I'm going boy, girl, boy, girl—[laughter]—so that everybody gets a fair chance. Okay, this gentleman right here, in the purple shirt.\nNationalism/Globalization\nQ. Thank you very much. First of all, I just want to say thank you for being such a great world leader over your tenure. I truly think that you've done your best in making the world a better place.\nThe President. I appreciate that.\nQ. My name is Louby Georges.\nThe President. Thank you. Where you are from, Louby?\nQ. I'm from the Bahamas.\nThe President. Hey.\nQ. I'm the son of two Haitian immigrants living in the Bahamas. And I'm a human rights activist and also a radio talk show host. I filter my advocacy work through radio, because it's a great form of communication in getting everybody involved.\nNonetheless, you spoke about youth and us shaping the future and the direction and the world and what it's going to be in the very near future. But I'll give you a quick example of what I experience and then a question that can apply to all of us here as young people.\nAs a person being born to Haitian parents, immigrants, in the Bahamas, there is a certain perception on you not being a native. And governments have fed on that over time. And so the average individual that you would come into contact with, they would see you in a certain light. And so the opportunities to assist then, to help your country, then are diminished. For example, I'm trying to bridge the gap between Haitians and Bahamians in the Bahamas, but government officials and other individuals, they would have said, \"Well, you—you're fighting for Haitians to take over the Bahamas.\" Well. it's not that. I just want Bahamians and Haitians to live in peace in the Bahamas.\nAnd so if you had the opportunity to have all of our Prime Ministers and Presidents in one room, and you had one word of advice that you could have given those leaders in regards to young people and especially millennials, what would you say to those leaders?\nThe President. Well, you know, I've had that opportunity a number of times. They don't always follow my advice. [Laughter]\nBut to your broader point, look, we live in a world that is smaller than ever before. Because of the Internet, because of modern travel, your generation gets ideas and culture and your politics from everywhere, right? You are listening to everything from Rolling Stones to Kendrick Lamar, to salsa, to reggaeton, to—[laughter]—right?\nSo what is true in music, what's true in food is also true in terms of politics and ideas. And the great thing about young people is, is that that's made your identities both national, but also international. So people here are Peruvian, but you're also people who care about what happens around this continent and around the world. It means that you can be both proud of your Haitian heritage and live in the Bahamas and also be concerned about what happens in Africa or what is happening in Myanmar. That's a good thing.\nNow, I'll be honest with you, older people sometimes are more threatened than younger people by this convergence because—you know, now that I've got gray hair, I see what happens as you get older—you get set in your ways, and you are afraid of things that are new. And oftentimes, politicians can feed into that sense that everything is changing so fast, let's go back to our old identities, identities of race or tribe or nationality.\nAnd my main advice, not just to world leaders, but more importantly, to world citizens—to citizens around the world is, if you're defining yourself just by what you're not, if you're defining yourself just by the color of your skin or where you were born, then you are not fully appreciating what will give you a strong identity and meaning in your life and what will lead to prosperity and security for everyone. And that is the values and ideals that we should all promote: That we respect everybody, regardless of what they look like. That we give everybody opportunity no matter where they were born, whether they were born poor or they were born rich. That we have laws that everybody has to observe, not just laws for one set of people and then a different set of laws for other people.\nBecause the problem with that approach—a very narrow way of thinking about yourself—is that that means almost inevitably, you have to be in conflict with somebody else. Right? If the most important thing about you is that you are an American—if that's the one thing that defines you—then you may end up being threatened by people from other places, when in fact you may have a lot in common and you may miss opportunities.\nNow, you—I'm a very proud American, and my job as President of the United States is to look out for American interests. But my argument to the American people has always been, the best way for us to look out for American interests is to also care about what's happening in our neighborhood. Because if their house is burning down, eventually, my house will burn down. The best way for my daughters to be secure as Americans is to make sure that people in El Salvador or Guatemala are also feeling some security, because if they're not, then eventually, that may spill over the borders to us.\nAnd some of the challenges that we face today are ones that no single group can solve. You look at something like climate change: That knows no borders. If there is pollution in China, it affects you here in Peru. If we are going to make sure that the oceans don't rise so that suddenly all the streets around Lima are 2 feet underwater, then it's going to require everybody taking the kind of collective action that we talked about in the Paris Agreement.\nSo I think that there—we should all have the capacity, and governments should reflect this capacity, to be proud of our particular circumstance, be proud that you're Haitian, be proud that you're in the Bahamas, be proud that you're a young, Black man. Be proud of your particular identity, but also see what you have in common with people who don't look like you or don't come from the same place as you do. Because if we see what we have in common, then we're going to be able to work together, and that's going to be good for all of us. If all we see is differences, then we're automatically going to be in competition, and in order for me to do well, that means I have to put you down, which then makes you want to put me down, and everybody stays down here instead of everybody lifting each other up. It's the most important thing we can do.\nAll right, so it's a woman's turn. Okay, everybody is pointing at this young lady. All her friends were pointing at her, so she has something very important to say.\nEducation\nQ. Welcome to Peru, Mr. President.\nThe President. Thank you.\nQ. My name is Sofia, and my friends and I are students at Laboratoria. I know you have met Mariana—[inaudible]. Do you remember about Laboratoria?\nThe President. I'm sorry, what? I'm sorry.\nQ. Do remember about Laboratoria?\nThe President. Yes.\nQ. With Mariana Costa?\nThe President. Yes, yes.\nQ. Okay, I'm a student over there, me and my friends. We are so lucky to be studying over there to get a job in tech, but there are so many young people still without these type of opportunities. So what do you recommend to open more quality education or job opportunities for young people in Latin America?\nThe President. Well, the program you describe is doing great work, and there's a lot of good work all across Latin America. One of the goals is to make sure that not only are we providing a great education for people at the youngest ages—basic reading, arithmetic, all those things—but today, you also need to have some knowledge of technology. And what we're trying to do is to work with governments and NGOs to expand access to the Internet, to digital platforms. And what we also want to do then is to help design curriculum and programs through the Internet so that online learning is accessible in places where previously there might not be opportunities. And we're seeing some of those investments here in Peru. That's part of the broader educational program that we have throughout Latin America. But we can still do more. And it's not just us, it's a public-private partnership also. So having Facebook participate and Microsoft and other—and Google and other big companies who have an interest in an educated population, because the more educated and more wired they are, the more, over time, customers are using their products and their platforms.\nWhat we want to do is to make sure that everybody, even in the smallest village, has suddenly this library to the world and to the best educational opportunities, even if there's not a big university in that small town. And some of the learning that we can do, it doesn't have to be 4 years. Sometimes, a 6-week program could teach people coding in computers, and suddenly, right away, that person has a job, and then they can learn more and ultimately go and get a 4-year education. But oftentimes, what you need is just that first step.\nAnd we're doing this in the United States, by the way. It's not just in Latin America. In the United States, one of the things that we're finding is that we need to expand computer science and literacy in the schools. We need to make sure, also, that we set up technical training systems where somebody who's unemployed in a city where there used to be a big factory, but now the factory is closed; or because of automation and robots, there are—fewer people are working there; those people who have lost their jobs, they may not be able to afford to just go to a 4-year university, give them 6 weeks, 8 weeks, 10 weeks of training. Get them in a job right now, and then over time, they can learn even more. All right?\nSo congratulations. You guys are doing good work. Good.\nAll right. Okay, so this is a team effort now. It's good to see this cooperation. Everybody is pointing at one person. [Laughter] All right, this gentleman right here, right in the front.\nImmigration/U.S. Olympic Team/Cuba-U.S. Relations/European Migration Crisis\nQ. Well, hello, Mr. President. I am a—I'm a student representative from this beautiful university with this gorgeous group of people. My name is Kai. And I'm going to give a little bit of context to my question. You see, the smartest man I know is my dad. My dad was born in Cuba. And when he was 7 years old, he went to the United States to get an opportunity. He lived all of his university life there, from community college to doctorate, and he managed to do a lot of things because the U.S.A. had an open-arm policy towards him.\nToday, many immigrants can bring innovation to the U.S.A. because it has still this open-arms policy. But the administration that is set to go after you is allegedly saying that it will have a closed-door policy. In your opinion, what do you think that today the stand of the U.S.A. is for offshore innovators that want to leave their comfort zone to the U.S.A., to go to Harvard, MIT, Yale, to find and to strive? And what would be the damages of the U.S.A. closing their doors to these young innovators?\nThe President. Good.\nQ. And a final remark, I hope you have 2 amazing last months of Presidency. Thank you.\nThe President. Thank you. Thank you very much. Well, the—well first of all, I know that your father is very proud that you said he's the smartest man you know. I hope that Malia and Sasha have said—would say the same thing about their father. [Laughter] I don't know. [Laughter] But I'm sure that made him feel good. Look, America is a nation of immigrants. Those of you who visited America, if you walk in an American city—not just New York or Los Angeles, but St. Louis or Indianapolis or Columbus, Ohio—if you walk down the street, you see people that look like they could be from anyplace. Because the fact is, is that except for the Native American populations, everybody in America came from someplace else. All of us are immigrants. And that's been our greatest strength, because we've been able to attract talent from everywhere.\nI use this as an example: You notice that the United States did really well in the Olympics. Now, some of that is because we're a big country, we're a wealthy country, so we have all these training facilities, and we can do all kinds of—best equipment. And I—all that is true. But you know what, I mean China is a bigger country and spends a lot of money also. The big advantage that America has, if you look at our team—actually, two big advantages. First, we passed something called title IX many years ago that requires that women get the same opportunities in sports as men do. And that's why—one of the reasons the American teams did so well is, the women were amazing, and just because they've gotten opportunities. Right? Which teaches us something about the need to make sure that women and men, boys and girls, get the same opportunities. Because you do better when everybody has a chance, not just some.\nBut the second thing: You look at a U.S. Olympic team, and there are all kinds of different sorts of people of all different shapes and sizes. And part of it is because we draw from a bigger genetic pool than anybody, right? [Laughter] We have people who—these little gymnasts, they're like this big. [Laughter] Simone Biles came by the White House. She's—tiny little thing. Amazing athlete. Then, we have Michael Phelps, he's 6' 8\", and his shoulders are this big. And that's good for swimming. He couldn't do gymnastics, but he's a really good swimmer.\nThe point is, is that when you have all this talent from all these different places, then you actually, as a team, do better. And that's been the great gift of America.\nNow, what we have to do not just in the United States, but in all countries, is to find a way to have a open, smart immigration policy, but it has to be orderly and lawful. And I think that part of what's happened in the United States is that even though the amount of illegal immigration that was—that is happening has actually gone down while I've been President, the perception is that it has just gone up. Partly, this is because it used to be that immigrants primarily stayed in Texas and Arizona and New Mexico, border countries, or in Florida. And now they're moving into parts of the country that aren't used to seeing immigrants, and it makes people concerned: Who are these people, and are they taking our jobs, and are they taking opportunity, and so forth?\nSo my argument has been that no country can have completely open borders, because if they did, then nationality and citizenship wouldn't mean anything. And obviously, if we had completely open borders, then you would have tens of millions of people who would suddenly be coming into the United States, which, by the way, wouldn't necessarily be good for the countries where they leave, because in some places like in Africa, you have doctors and nurses and scientists and engineers who all try to leave, and then you have a brain drain, and they're not developing their own countries.\nSo you have to have some rules, but my hope is, is that those rules are set up in a way that continues to invite talented young people to come in and contribute and to make a good life for themselves. What we also, though, have to do is to invest in countries that are sending migrants so that they can develop themselves. So you mentioned Cuba, for example, where your father fled. He left in part because they didn't feel that there was enough opportunity there. Part of the reason I said let's reopen our diplomatic relations with Cuba is to see if you can start encouraging greater opportunity and freedom in Cuba. Because if you have people who have been able to leave Cuba and do really well in the United States, that means they have enough talent that they should be able to do really well by staying at home in Cuba.\nThere are enormously talented people here in Peru. I don't want all the young people in Peru to suddenly all go—[applause]—I don't want you to feel as if you have to go to New York in order to be successful. You should be able to be successful right here in Lima, right?\nSo this is true in the Americas, it's true in Europe, where, obviously, they've been flooded—and it's been very controversial—with migrants, some of them displaced from war in Syria, but some of them just coming for economic reasons from Africa. I just left meetings with European leaders, and we discussed the fact that if we're investing more in development in those African countries, and encouraging greater rule of law and less corruption and more opportunity in those countries, then people are less likely to want to come to Germany or Italy for their futures because they feel that they can make a future where they are.\nBut this is an example of what I was saying earlier. If we think only about—very narrow terms, about our borders and what's good for us, and ignore what's happening everywhere else, eventually, it will have an impact on us whether we like it or not. Because the world is just much smaller than it used to be. All right?\nOkay. Let's see, you've got a—all right, young lady right there. Go ahead, in the black, yes. Yes, you.\nWomen's Rights and Gender Equality\nQ. Oh, my God, thank you for this amazing opportunity. More than a question—well, I have to introduce myself first, sorry.\nThe President. Yes.\nQ. I'm Jennifer Schell, and I'm from Venezuela. We already talked a little about my country, but I just want to thank you for giving us the women's opportunity to make us feel empowered.\nI run a—I'm the CEO and founder of the Trabaja Mamá, a social initiative that promotes values for mothers around the world. I'm a mother. I have a daughter, and it's a little bit hard to become an entrepreneur. And I know that you have been supporting woman empowerment. You support a candidate who was a woman, Hillary. You are supported by your wife Michelle.\nThe President. Michelle is amazing.\nQ. And what is—I'm sure, I'm sure. I'm sure of that.\nSo I know how you have been telling a lot of advices for young leaders. But I want an especial advice for female entrepreneurs, for those who have to strive a little bit more.\nThe President. Yes, yes.\nQ. For those who are mothers who have to split their self and ask herself, should I be a mother or should I be a professional? I truly believe that we can be both at the same time, but I would like to hear it from you—an advice for all the womens, potential womens that are going to become a mother, will have our future generations.\nAnd on behalf of all my YLAI Fellows, thank you for this amazing opportunity. And all the Fellows that are looking—there are more Fellows looking right now from their countries because they couldn't come to Peru, so thank you for all the Fellows that are watching right us now, and thank you for it.\nThe President. Okay. Well, it's a great question. The—I mean, Michelle probably would have more to say about this—[laughter]—because, you know, she's gone through it as a professional woman. But let me offer just a few observations.\nFirst of all, the leaders and the men in every country need to understand that the countries that are most successful are going to be the countries that give opportunities to girls and women and not just boys and men. Now that's—[applause].\nAnd if you look at which countries are doing best—most advanced, grow the fastest—it's partly because you can't have half the population uneducated, not working, out of the house, not in leadership positions, and expect to be as good as a country where a hundred percent of the people are getting a good education and having opportunities and can do amazing things: starting a business or entering into politics or what have you.\nSo this is not just a problem for girls and women; men have to also recognize, this is good for you. And if you're a strong man, you shouldn't be threatened that women are doing well. You should be proud that women are doing well. And families where women have opportunity, that means they're going to be able to bring in more income, which means the family as a whole is going to do better.\nAnd let's be honest, sometimes, you know, that whole machismo attitude sometimes makes it harder for women to succeed, and sometimes, that is coming even from those who love them. So, men, those of you who end up being fathers and you've got daughters, you've got to lift up your daughters. You can't—just telling them they're pretty is not enough. You've got to tell them they're smart, and you've got to tell them they're ambitious, and you have to give them opportunity.\nSo once you have the whole country thinking in those terms, then you need to start having policies that can support women, and the most important thing, in addition to making sure that girls from an early age are getting a good education and that they're not being told, oh, you can just do certain things—like engineering, that's a man's job, or being scientist, that's a man's job or—no, no, girls can do everything. It can't be just, you know, be a teacher, or—which is a wonderful profession, but traditionally, women sometimes are just told there are a few things they can do—nurse, teacher—as opposed to anything. Right?\nSo that starts—once you've done that, then you have to recognize that the big conflict that women have in the professional world has to do with family and childrearing. And for biological reasons, women have more of a burden than men do. But it's not just biology, it's also sociology, all right? Men's attitudes is, well, yes, I don't have to do as much. And even in my marriage with Michelle, I like to think of myself as a modern, enlightened man, but I'll admit it, Michelle did more work than I did with Sasha and Malia.\nSo part of what societies can do, though, is they can help with, for example, having smart policies for childcare. One of the hardest things for professional women, particularly when their children are still small and not yet in school, is who's going to take care of my baby when I'm working, and how do I make sure that they're safe and that they're trusted. So making sure that governments have policies in place that help—now, having a mother-in-law who helps, that's also very useful. [Laughter] But not everybody has the option where they have family members who are close by. So that's an example of something that we have to really work on. Then, we have to put pressure on institutions to treat women equally when it comes to getting loans to start a business. Up until just maybe 20 years ago, in some places—in the United States even—a husband had to sign a loan document with a bank, even though it was the wife's business, even if the woman was the one making the money, it was her idea, it was her investment, she was doing all the work. Because of these old stereotypes, you're having men cosign. That kind of mentality, that kind of discrimination still exists in a lot of institutions.\nSo we have to push back against those, we have to fight against those. Women who are successful, you have to then fight for the women who—the younger women who are coming behind you and make sure that you're changing some of these attitudes. If you are high up in a bank, then you've got to make sure that these policies are good for women. If you succeed in politics, then you have to help promote and encourage women who are coming behind you.\nSo the last thing, I guess, I would say would be—I know that Michelle says this to our daughters: You can be a wonderful mom and have a wonderful family and have a really successful career. You may have to kind of not try to do everything all at the same time exactly. You may have to time things out a little bit and have a husband who supports taking turns a little bit. So it may be that when the child is very young, you're not doing something that is as hard, because having a really young child is already really hard, and you have to sleep sometimes. But then, as the child gets older, maybe that's when you are doing something—maybe your husband is doing something that gives him more time to support that child. Right? So there's going to have to be finding the right balance throughout your life in order to be successful. All right?\nBut congratulations on the good work you're doing.\nAll right, I've got time for—so I only have time for two more questions. I'll call on that gentleman up there with the glasses, yes, in the blue shirt. No, no, right here. Wait, wait, wait—let him ask his question, and then I'll ask the last one. Go ahead.\nThe President's Advice to Young People\nQ. Hello, Mr. President.\nThe President. Hello!\nQ. It's really an honor to ask you this question. Well, my name is Alonso Cornejo. I'm from—I'm studying marketing at Universidad San Ignacio Loyola. And my question is about what advices will you give to Peruvian students that they are starting to think different, to making a change not just in Peru, just about [but; White House correction.] all worldwide—make a change about worldwide. To what advices will you give them? Right now we live in a world that maybe the bad is good, and the good is bad. So what advices will you give them to chase their dreams, make a country better—not Peru, just worldwide? That will be my question. Thank you.\nThe President. Well, look, the—you're already doing so well. I don't know that I can give you the perfect advice. But I'll tell you what I tell my young people who work in the White House and who I meet in the United States, because I think it's—what's true in the United States is true for you as well.\nWe live at a time where you're always seeing bad news. All right? Everybody is—bad news gets a lot of attention. But the truth is that, in so many ways, the world is better now than it was 20 years ago or 40 years ago or 100 years ago. People are healthier today, they're wealthier today, they're better educated today. The world, if you look overall, is less violent than it was. Look at the 20th century; millions of people dying everywhere. Look at Latin America and the wars that were taking place everywhere across the continent. And so you actually are living in a time of relative peace and historic prosperity.\nAnd I say that so that you should feel optimistic about the future. You shouldn't feel pessimistic. Yes, you're always seeing bad news, but the truth is, the world is in a place where it can solve its problems and be even better 20 years from now or 50 years from now. You have to start with that hope, that sense of optimism inside you, because if you don't feel that way, then you don't bother to try to have an impact, because you think, ah, every politician is corrupt, and all the governments are terrible, and people are greedy, and people are mean, and so I'm just going to look out for myself. And then, nothing gets better. So you have to start knowing that things have gotten better and can continue to get better. That's number one.\nNumber two, I always tell young people to—and I don't know if this translates well in Spanish—but I say: Worry more about what you want to do and not what you want to be. Now, here is what I mean. I think a lot of people, they say to themselves, \"I want to be rich,\" or they say to themselves, \"I want to be powerful.\" Or they say, \"I want to be the President,\" or \"I want to be a CEO,\" so they—or, \"I want to be a rap star\" or whatever. So they say they have this idea, but the people I know who are most successful, usually, they're successful because they found something that they really care about, and they worked at it and became really good at it. And over time, because they were so good at what they did, they ended up being rich, or they ended up being powerful and influential. But in the meantime, they were constantly doing what they enjoyed doing and learning, and that's what made them successful.\nSo what I would say to all of you is, find something you care deeply about. If you care about poor children, then find a way right now that you can start helping some poor children. Don't wait, saying to yourself, oh, someday, when I'm President of Peru, I'm going to help poor children. [Laughter] No, go now and find an organization or create an organization that is helping poor kids learn or be exposed to new experiences. If you care about the environment, don't wait. In addition to your studies, you could start having an impact right now on trying to improve your local community or trying to be involved in some of the work that's being done around things like climate change.\nThe point is that once you decide what it is that you really care about, there are ways for you to now get involved and pursue that passion. And if you pursue that passion and you get good at it, you're not going to change the world overnight. Nobody does. I mean, I eventually, at the age of 45, became a Senator and then the President of the United States, but I worked for 25 years in poor communities and worked on issues. And hopefully, I was doing some good, even before I was famous or powerful, so that if I hadn't ended up being President I could still look back and say, I worked on the things that I cared about and I got something done that was important. And that, I think, is the most important advice that I have for you.\nAll right, last question. It's a woman's turn. So all the men, you can put your—all the boys can put their hands down. It's a woman's turn.\nOkay, go ahead, right there. Right there.\nImportance of History\nQ. Okay, first of all, my name is Melisa. I represent Universidad Peruana de Ciencias Aplicadas. And besides, I'm a proud member of UPC—[inaudible]. And once again, I want to welcome you to this amazing country. And on behalf of this whole audience, I would like to thank you for this amazing opportunity.\nOkay, so my question is the following. As it is well known, during your Presidency, you have stepped up and accepted mistakes you made yourself or maybe the team you're leading. And that's—I believe that shows how you reaffirm your belief in introspection and how you want to leave the past behind. What would your advice to us entrepreneurs, most of us, that would like to leave the mistakes—learn from them, step up, and leave what's the past in the past? Thank you, President.\nThe President. Well, you know, I don't—you shouldn't ignore the past. You should learn from it. And you should learn from history and learn from experience.\nThe truth is that I was—right before I came to Peru, I was in Europe, and I started my trip in Athens. And I went to the Parthenon, the birthplace of democracy. And you look at all these buildings from ancient Greece, and you try to imagine all the things that were happening in that time, and it seems very long ago. But the fact of the matter is, is that humanity keeps on making the same mistakes, and we oftentimes find ourselves dealing with the same problems and the same issues. So studying our past, studying our history, is very, very important.\nBut the main thing I tell you and I tell my own daughters is, you can't be trapped by the past. There's a difference between understanding your past. You need to know the history of Peru. If you live in the United States, you need to know how America came about, and that includes both the amazing, wonderful things, but also the bad things. I mean, you have to—if you want to understand America today, then you have to understand slavery, and you have to understand the history of immigration and how the debates we're having today about immigration aren't that different from when the Irish or the Italians came and people were saying, we can't have any more Italians, and we can't have any more Irish. If you don't know that, then you aren't going to understand the patterns that we are having today.\nBut the point is, is that we have the power to make our own history. We don't have to repeat the same mistakes. We don't have to just be confined to what has happened before or what is going on today. We can think differently and imagine differently and do things differently.\nThe one thing that we should remember, though, is that even as we try to do things that are new, we should remember that change generally doesn't happen overnight. It happens over time. So I say that to young people because sometimes they get impatient. In the United States, sometimes, people say to me, oh, why don't—why haven't we eliminated racial discrimination in the United States? And I say, well, we've made a lot of progress since I was born. In terms of human history, if you think on the scale of hundreds of years or thousands of years—in 50 years, the changes that have taken place have been amazing.\nSo you have to understand that even though we can think differently, societies don't move immediately. It requires hard work, and you have to persuade people. And sometimes, you take two steps forward, and then you take one step back. And you shouldn't be discouraged when that happens, because history doesn't just move in a smooth, straight line.\nThe good news is that we have more access to information than we've ever had before. Young people are in a position to change the world faster than ever before. And I am confident that if you are respectful of people and you look for what you have in common with humanity, if you stay true to the values of kindness and respect and reason and trying to live together in peace, that the world will keep getting better. And I'll be looking forward to seeing all the amazing things that you do in the years to come.\nOkay? Thank you very much, everybody.

I am looking forward to the opportunity to once again meet with President Xi. Over the past 3½ years, we have met 9 times. And the frequency of our engagement has enabled us to advance cooperation on shared challenges and manage differences between our countries effectively.\nWe've collaborated on key global challenges. From supporting global growth to preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, to ending the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, we've demonstrated what's possible when our two countries work together.\nIn particular, the United States and China have played a pivotal role in pressing the world to act on climate change. When I was in Hangzhou, our nations formally joined the Paris Agreement. Now we face the work of making sure our economies transition to become more sustainable.\nIn terms of regional security, President Xi and I are united on our strong opposition to North Korea's provocations, and we will intensify our efforts to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula. In the South China Sea, the United States continues to urge all claimants to lower tensions and peacefully resolve disputes.\nI expect we'll also have a candid conversation on areas where we continue to differ, including the creation of a more level playing field for our businesses to compete, innovation policies, excess capacity, and human rights.\nThis will be my last meeting as President with President Xi, so I want to take this opportunity to note our work together to build a more durable and productive set of bilateral ties. I view the relationship between our two countries as the most consequential in the world. I continue to believe that a constructive U.S.-China relationship benefits our two peoples and benefits the entire globe. And the structure and framework of cooperation, the frequent meetings and consultations that we've established, I think, has been extremely productive.\nSo I want to thank President Xi and his delegation for their efforts in this regard.\nPresident Xi. Well, it's my great pleasure to meet you, Mr. President, in Lima. This is our third meeting in 2016 and our ninth meeting over the past 3 years and more. This really shows the two sides' shared commitment to the China-U.S. relationship. And, Mr. President, I would like to commend you for the active efforts you've made to grow this relationship.\nSince we met in Hangzhou in early September, the China-U.S. relationship has, generally speaking, continued to grow in a stable manner. There have been frequent exchanges at the top and other levels. We've made new progress in cooperation on the economy, mil-to-mil, law enforcement, judiciary, subnational exchanges, people-to-people contacts and so on. And the two sides have kept up close communication and coordination on climate change, the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue, and other important international, regional, and global issues.\nWe meet at a hinge moment in the China-U.S. relationship. I hope the two sides will work together to focus on cooperation, manage our differences and make sure there is a smooth transition in the relationship and that it will continue to grow going forward. Both China and the United States are important member economies in APEC. China stands ready to have more coordination with the U.S. and to work alongside others to make sure the meeting in Peru is a success and to inject new momentum into regional economic cooperation and the growth of the Asia-Pacific economy.\nThank you.", "timestamp": "2016-11-19", "title": "Remarks Prior to a Meeting With President Xi Jinping of China in Lima, Peru"}

Trump's nomination of U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions for Attorney General.\nIN CASE YOU MISSED IT...\nFormer Deputy Attorney General of the United States under President George W. Bush Larry Thompson: \"I can tell you as a friend and someone who has known Jeff Sessions for 32 years that Jeff does not have a racist bone in his body. When I first met Jeff, he was U.S. Attorney in Mobile and I was the U.S. Attorney in Atlanta. In order to stretch our limited per diems on travel to Department of Justice conferences, we often booked single rooms with double beds in hotels. You really get to know a person when you interact so closely with them.\n\"When I was asked by Attorney General William French Smith to head the Southeastern Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force simply because of my strategic location in Atlanta, a delicate situation was presented. The Task Force consisted of eleven other U.S. Attorney Offices but any potential problem was avoided because Jeff rallied the other U.S. Attorneys around our common cause and my leadership.\n\"As a former federal prosecutor, Jeff knows the workings of the Justice Department inside and out. He is thoroughly familiar with the legal issues the Department will face. He understands the mission of the Department and will carry out his duties in a professional, thoughtful, and balanced manner. More recently, Jeff voted to confirm President Obama's choice as Attorney General, Eric Holder.\n\"By the way, I have been an African American for 71 years and I think I know a racist when I experience one. Jeff Sessions is simply a good and decent man.\"\nFormer Attorney General John Ashcroft: \"The political 'drive-by-assassins' who have trotted out the 30-year-old fabrication of racism are utterly devoid of the truth. When attackers resort to 30-year-old falsehoods it is clear evidence of their lack of substantive objection.\n\"Jeff is devoted to the proposition that equity before the law and in our society is at the heart and soul of what it means to be American. Nothing so completely rivals the injustice of racism more profoundly than the reckless labelling of persons who are not.\n\"Jeff Sessions has earned the trust of America with over three decades of fair and equitable service to the entirety of our culture. He deserves our commendation and support, not conjured, baseless attacks.\"\nU.S. Civil Rights Commissioner Peter Kirsanow: \"Senator Sessions is a good man and a great man. He has done more to protect the jobs and enhance the wages of black workers than anyone in either house of Congress over the last 10 years. Of all the Senators and public officials that I've dealt with, I cannot think of anyone who has been more devoted to issues related to wages and employment levels of all Americans, but particularly black American workers.\n\"[Senator Sessions] is a man of tremendous integrity. I think it was an inspired pick. He's going to be a marvelous Attorney General.\n\"It's scandalous that they're trying to say he's a racist. They are trying to demonize the Alabama of 2016 as somehow being the Alabama of 1946. And they are trying to similarly falsely caricature Sen. Sessions. But that is not the case. I've gotten the opportunity to deal with him on a regular basis and he is a wonderful human being.\"\nCivil Rights Attorney and founder of the Black American Leadership Alliance Leah Durant: \"Senator Sessions has been a leader in the fight for preserving American jobs and ensuring opportunities for African American workers.\"\nRobert N. Driscoll, managing partner, McGlinchey Stafford, Washington, D.C., and former deputy assistant attorney general in the U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division: \"Senator Sessions could be a good attorney general for civil rights because he will be driven by the law. His interpretation of the law will not please everyone, but I predict it will be fairly applied without fear or favor. Clear cases will be prosecuted with vigor. Creative interpretations of the law may cease, but the meat-and-potatoes work of the division (intentional discrimination, police misconduct, disability law) will continue apace, conducted without impropriety or political favoritism. That alone will be a breath of fresh air.\"\nNational Sheriffs' Association: \"Senator Sessions would be an outstanding nominee for U.S. Attorney General. Sen. Sessions has enormous integrity, fidelity to the rule of law, substantial experience and a commitment to fairness and equal justice under the law. Those are qualities America needs as its chief law enforcement officer to the Federal Government.\n\"Throughout his career, Senator Sessions has steadfastly supported the men and women who risk their lives every day to preserve the rule of law. Senator Sessions is an experienced prosecutor with a world-class legal mind, serving as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama, Alabama Attorney General and for two decades on the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, which oversees the Department of Justice.\n\"Senator Sessions would be an extraordinary Attorney General and we're hopeful the new administration nominates him and the U.S. Senate quickly confirms.\"\nNational District Attorneys Association (NDAA): \"Today, the National District Attorneys Association, representing 2,500 diverse Republican and Democratic elected prosecutors and their 40,000 assistants, formally endorsed Senator Jeff Sessions from the State of Alabama to be the 84th Attorney General of the United States. Rarely in the history of this great country has a candidate been more qualified to serve in this capacity in an effort to promote and protect public safety.\n\"The breadth of Senator Sessions experience is vast. Born in Selma, Alabama to hard working parents who operated a general store, the Senator was educated at Huntington College in Montgomery and received his law degree from the University of Alabama in 1973.\n\"Manifesting an early interest in public service, Sessions became a U.S. Army Reservist, eventually reaching the rank of Captain. He was appointed U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Alabama in 1981, a post he held with distinction for 12 years. He was elected Alabama Attorney General in 1994 and served until his election to the United States Senate in 1996, where he has served his state and country until today. His background in both state and federal prosecution makes him uniquely qualified to be our nation's top law enforcement official.\n\"While in the Senate, Senator Sessions has fought tirelessly in support of prosecutors and crime victims through his efforts to maintain the ability of law enforcement and prosecutors to seize the illgotten gains of criminal enterprises and, perhaps most impressively, his efforts to champion the cause of our most vulnerable victims, namely children devastated by the evils of physical and sexual abuse.\"\nOn his nomination, NDAA Alabama State Director Steve Marshall said, \"Jeff Sessions has been a passionate advocate for criminal justice issues shown through his full support of law enforcement and prosecutors across the country. He will serve us well as this country's next Attorney General.\"\nMajor County Sheriffs' Association (MCSA): \"Your service and knowledgeable experience within the field of criminal justice makes you a uniquely qualified candidate and will undoubtedly serve you well.\n\"Expected to lead the U.S. Department of Justice on issues from tackling complex organized crime and cyber-threats, to sophisticated fraud and terrorism, the Attorney General of the United States requires not only a strong command of all justice concerns, but the ability to work cooperatively and closely with a broad community of law enforcement agencies and leaders across the country. Within the current Administration, there has been a continued pattern of making critical decisions affecting the law enforcement community without adequate stakeholder consultation. Issues range from the acquisition of military surplus equipment to immigration enforcement and asset forfeiture.\n\"You have continued to be a strong advocate for law enforcement and we sincerely thank you for your hard work and commitment to public safety. As an association of elected sheriffs representing our nation's largest counties with populations of 500,000 people or more, serving over 100 million Americans, we seek to be a positive source of ideas and solutions and you have been a reliable and valuable partner of the MCSA.\"\nNational Association of Police Organizations, Inc. (NAPO): \"You have been a voice for law enforcement on many issues facing our community as a Senator and member of the Judiciary Community and we look forward to continue working with you on these issues as the head of the Department of Justice. We are proud to offer you our whole-hearted support.\n\"NAPO is a coalition of police units and associations from across the United States that serves to advance the interests of America's law enforcement officers. Founded in 1978, NAPO now represents more than 1,000 police units and associations, 241,000 sworn law enforcement officers, and more than 100,000 citizens who share a common dedication to fair and effective crime control and law enforcement.\n\"NAPO has enjoyed working with you and having your support on many of our priority legislation, including the Thin Blue Line Act and the Lifesaving Gear for Police Act. As this nation is experiencing an increase in the number of assaults on law enforcement officers, these two bills are essential to protecting the lives of officers. We hope to see President Obama's Executive Order 13688 restricting law enforcement's access to surplus military equipment overturned by President Trump.\n\"You have shown a strong understanding of law enforcement's needs, as further exemplified by your amendment to the Electronic Communications Privacy Act Amendments Act to include emergency exceptions to the warrant requirement. This understating is again illustrated by your opposition to the expansive Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act and your endorsement of the Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect Americans Act. We thank you for your continued support for America's law enforcement officers.\n\"NAPO looks forward to continue working with you on these and other key issues affecting the law enforcement community in your new position.\"\nNational Association of Assistant U.S. Attorneys (NAAUSA): The National Association of Assistant U.S. Attorneys expresses its strong support for the selection of Senator Jeff Sessions to become the next Attorney General of the United States. Senator Sessions, a former Assistant U.S. Attorney, U.S. Attorney, Alabama Attorney General, four-term U.S. Senator, and longtime member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, is a man of unquestionable integrity and unparalleled experience. Throughout his distinguished career he has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to the rule of law, fairness, and equal justice for all.\"\nNAAUSA President Steve Cook said \"Senator Sessions is uniquely equipped to be the chief law enforcement officer of our Nation and to lead the Department of Justice. We congratulate President-elect Trump for his selection of Senator Sessions to this important post and we look forward to his formal nomination and prompt confirmation by the Senate.\"\nRepublican Attorneys General Association: \"On behalf of the twenty-nine Republican Attorneys General across the country, we congratulate Jeff Sessions on his nomination to be our nation's Attorney General.\"\n\"Senator Sessions is a world-class legal mind and experienced prosecutor, having served his country admirably as both U.S. Attorney and Alabama Attorney General,\" said Luther Strange, Chairman of the Republican Attorneys General Association.\n\"Senator Sessions is respected across party lines in the U.S. Senate and has a strong civil rights record in his decades of public service. Senator Sessions is a credit to our nation and I know he will make us proud in his new role where he will continue to be a champion for our Constitution and the rule of law.\"", "timestamp": "2016-11-20", "title": "Press Release - IN CASE YOU MISSED IT...Civil Rights & Law Enforcement Groups Are Strongly Supporting Sen.

It is a friendship based on shared values, on extraordinarily close people-to-people ties, on shared economic interests, and a shared worldview.\nAnd this brief visit gave us an opportunity to exchange thoughts on how we move forward on a whole range of important issues. The Prime Minister had already reached out to President-elect Trump and his team. And I indicated to him my confidence that the U.S.-Australia alliance will remain as robust as ever, because it transcends party politics.\nWe had a chance to discuss the counter-ISIL campaign. Australia has been our most stalwart ally when it comes to troop deployments and the effort there. The progress that's being made in Iraq as Iraqi forces seek to retake Mosul, the training of Iraqi troops, making sure that we are prepared for any humanitarian aftermath of that campaign—much of that success can be attributed to the enormous contributions that are made by the Australian Government. And we're grateful not only to the Government, but most importantly to the men and women in uniform who serve.\nWe also had an opportunity to discuss some of the regional issues around the Asia-Pacific that had been of great interest to my administration as we have rebalanced and focused on the Asia-Pacific region more than had been focused on in the past. And we are aligned in our views that upholding open markets, promoting high-standard trade agreements like TPP, ensuring rule of law and international norms on issues like maritime disputes serve not only the interests of Australia and the United States, but also serve the interests of the region and the world.\nAnd as a consequence, it's not often where I have a meeting and I've got nothing to disagree with. [Laughter] Usually, there's something we can talk about to keep us busy. But there's a strong alignment of interests between the United States and Australia. And not only do I wish the Prime Minister luck as he moves forward, but I've assured him that we're going to do everything we can to have a strong handoff and continuity in the new administration so that we can continue to work together to promote prosperity for our people and security for our people.\nSo thank you so much, Malcolm.\nPrime Minister Turnbull. Well, thank you very much, Mr. President. And it is a great moment, but a sad moment, to have our last meeting with you in your capacity as President of the United States. I want to thank you for the leadership you've shown to your country and the world over 8 years.\nOur alliance has got stronger than ever, and that has been because it's based on those shared values, shared values made manifest by our commitment around the world to work together in freedom's cause, in the Middle East. And I thank you for the compliments you've paid our service men and women in the Middle East. We're working together there to retake Mosul, to bring an end to Daesh and its so-called caliphate, and to fight terrorism around the world. We're standing up for the rule of law around the world. And those understanding that the foundation of the prosperity that the world has enjoyed, the rise—the lifting of billions of people out of poverty has been made possible by that foundation of a rules-based international order underpinned by the commitment of the United States over so many years and especially over the last years during your Presidency.\nI want to thank you very much for your cooperation with us on so many issues: on humanitarian issues and resettlement issues in our own region. Thank you for that.\nAnd on trade, we are quite of the same mind of the importance of open markets, the way trade and increasing the opportunities for businesses to grow and develop, whether it's in Warrnambool or Wyoming—[laugher]—it benefits across the world. And we've agreed—as we have with the other leaders here—the importance of making the case for open markets repeatedly and more persuasively now than ever.\nI've been very impressed, Mr. President, by the way in which despite your party's disappointment with the election result in the United States, the way you've set out to reach out to the President-elect and, as we all do, wish him the best of success. We want America to succeed under the new President, just as it succeeded under your leadership. And your statesmanship and generosity sets a great example, which all of us admire.\nSo thank you very much for the great leadership you've shown, for the friendship you've shown. Australians and Americans are bound by shared values, as you've described. But above all, it's bound together by millions—literally millions—of people-to-people links and friendships and alliances with a large \"A,\" between nations and many, many alliances between businesses and families across the years.\nSo our relationship will get stronger than ever, but it has been immeasurably strengthened under your leadership, and we thank you for it.\nPresident Obama. Thank you, Malcolm. Thank you. You too. It means a lot.\nPrime Minister Turnbull. Thank you.\nPresident Obama. Good. Thank you, everybody.", "timestamp": "2016-11-20", "title": "Remarks Following a Meeting With Prime Minister Malcolm B. Turnbull of Australia in Lima, Peru"}

Well, it's a great pleasure to be able to spend a little bit of time with my good friend and the Prime Minister of one of our closest allies in the world, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and his team.\nThe friendship, the bonds, the links between Canada and the United States are obviously unparalleled. And it has been an extraordinary pleasure of mine over the last year and a half or so to be able to work directly with Justin on a whole host of issues.\nFirst and foremost, we have enormous commercial relations. And our teams have been able to advance and build on a whole range of progress around how we both manage our borders, but facilitate trade flows and tourism and all the things that are the lifeblood of the relationship between our two countries. We're going to try to get as much of that work completed in the last 2 months of my Presidency.\nCanada has been an outstanding partner in the fight against terrorism, not just in terms of intelligence gathering and information sharing, but also the incredibly important investments that they've made in the success of the counter-ISIL campaign and that they continue to make.\nJustin's personal voice on issues of refugees and the humanitarian concerns that we share has been a really important component of the success of things like our leadership Summit on Refugees at the U.N.\nAnd on climate, we represent two of the largest oil producers and natural gas producers in the world. Those are vital industries to us. And we continue to appreciate the contributions they make to our economy and to job creation. On the other hand, we also recognize that we have a huge stake in dealing with climate change for future generations. And our ability to collaborate was an important component in us being able to achieve the Paris Agreement and now be able to follow through on some of those commitments.\nSo I have to say that there are few leaders around the world who I think combine vision and talent and values the way that Justin does. And I am very much looking forward to his continued leadership in the years to come. And I look forward to visiting Canada often as a private citizen and may stop in and check in with his beautiful family when I get the opportunity.\nBut the one thing, I think, that we emphasized is that through conservative governments, liberal governments, Democratic or Republican governments, the relationship between the United States and Canada is one of the most important constants in the world, and I have no doubt that that will continue.\nSo thank you, Justin.\nPrime Minister Trudeau. Thank you, Barack.\n[At this point, Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and no translation was provided. He then spoke in English as follows.]\nPrime Minister Trudeau. It's always such a tremendous pleasure to sit down with Barack to talk about not just the deep connections—economic, people-to-people, cultural, security ties—between Canada and the United States, but also the vision we share for engaging the world in positive ways and promoting both opportunity and stability around the world. We discussed, as we always do, a broad range of issues, including a number of issues—specific issues important to Canadians and Americans. And whether it was softwood lumber or the preclearance agreement on our borders, there is continued work being done on making sure that we're doing right by our citizens.\nObviously, I am going to miss having Barack around to work the Canada-U.S. relationship with: we share a tremendous amount of values and outlook on the future. But I know at the same time, as we've both said many times, the relationship between Canada and the United States is extraordinarily deep and important. And I look forward to welcoming the President-elect up to Canada, hopefully, soon after the Inauguration. I've certainly invited him to come up.\nBut as for Barack, I know that he is going to continue to be a valuable and important voice on the world stage as a private citizen and as someone who will continue to fight for his values and his belief in how we can work together for a better world. But I also know that he is looking forward to taking some time with his beautiful family, Michelle and the two girls, and I wish them all the very best in the coming years.\nPresident Obama.

In his remarks, the President referred to President Bashar al-Asad of Syria; former White House Counsel Gregory B. Craig; Democratic Presidential nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton; and Supreme Court Associate Justice-designate Merrick B. Garland.", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119665", "text": "The President. Good evening, everybody. Let me begin by thanking President Kuczynski and the wonderful people of Peru for hosting us and for their outstanding hospitality. Peru is one of the United States strongest partners in the Americas, from standing up for democracy to promoting jobs and growth, to fighting climate change. And this summit has been a success thanks to the great work of our Peruvian friends. So on behalf of us all, muchas gracias.\nThis summit, and my trip over the past week, has obviously occurred against a backdrop of the broader debate over globalization and trade. As I've said, over the decades, our global, integrated economy has helped to improve the lives of billions of people around the world with historic gains in prosperity, education, and health. At the same time, when jobs and capital can move across borders, when workers have less leverage, when wealthy corporations and global elites too often seem to be playing by a different set of rules, then workers and communities can be hit especially hard. The gaps between the rich and everyone else grow wider. And that can reverberate through our politics.\nThat's why I firmly believe that one of our greatest challenges in the years ahead—across our nations and within them—will be to make sure that the benefits of the global economy are shared by more people and that the negative impacts, such as economic inequalities, are addressed by all nations. When it comes to trade, I believe that the answer is not to pull back or try to erect barriers to trade. Given our integrated economies and global supply chains, that would hurt us all. But rather, the answer is to do trade right, making sure that it has strong labor standards, strong environmental standards, that it addresses ways in which workers and ordinary people can benefit rather than be harmed by global trade. All of this is the central work of APEC.\nAs this debate moves forward in the United States, it's important to remember how vital the Asia-Pacific is to America's prosperity. The 21 Asia-Pacific economies here represent nearly 3 billion people, a majority of the global middle class, 6 of America's top 10 trading partners, more than half of the global economy, and the world's fastest growing region. In other words, these 21 countries represent tremendous opportunity for the United States to sell our goods and support U.S. jobs. And that's why, as part of the rebalance of our foreign policy to the Asia Pacific, we've boosted U.S. exports to the region by some 50 percent. Nearly 60 percent of our exports go to the region.\nAnd this is part of broader progress. With 95 percent of the world's customers beyond America's borders, I've made it a priority to open up new markets overseas. And during my administration, we've increased U.S. exports to the world by more than 40 percent—to record levels—and these exports support more than 11 million American jobs. Moreover, we know that companies that export tend to grow faster and hire more employees and pay their workers more than companies that do not export. All of which is why exports have helped to drive our economic recovery. It's one of the reasons that U.S. businesses have created more than 15 million new jobs.\nSo that's the kind of progress that trade—when done right—can deliver. And that's the kind of work that we've tried to do here at this summit. We're continuing our work to make it easier to do business between our countries so we're creating even more jobs. In the United States, we're simplifying the process of starting a new business, increasing access to credit, all of which will help more ventures, especially small businesses, get up and running, and helping them to be able to export as well so that they can access a global market even if they can't afford fancy lawyers and accountants and foreign offices.\nWe agreed to increase our collective effort against corruption by targeting the bribery that enriches elites at the expense of people. And we committed to making it easier to trade in services as well as goods.\nWe also discussed the excess capacity that exists in certain sectors, like steel and aluminum, that distorts markets and hurts business and workers, including American workers. And even as I've argued that we cannot engage in protectionist measures, my administration has been at the forefront of really cracking down hard on unfair trade practices and brought consistently cases against the—cases under the WTO against those who are engaging in unfair trading practices, and we've had a great track record of trade enforcement that has to be a part of this process.\nI've been very clear that excess capacity is not the result of market forces. It's the result of specific government policies and it needs to be fixed. And here at APEC, we've been taking steps—as we were at the G-20 in Hangzhou—to start addressing these issues in a systematic way.\nWith regard to the digital economy, we endorsed rules to protect the privacy of personal information as it crosses borders. We discussed the importance of maintaining the current moratorium on customs duties for digital goods and innovation. And giving—given growing cyber threats, our 21 APEC economies affirmed that no one should conduct or support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets, with the intent to providing a competitive advantage to companies or commercial sectors.\nWe're also moving ahead with making our economies more inclusive. And one particular area of focus is making sure that women have fair access to economic growth: expanding education; expanding access to careers in science, technology, engineering, and math; helping more women entrepreneurs to access finance and integrate their businesses into the global supply chain. According to one study, if women around the world participated in the labor force, it could add up to $28 trillion of additional output for the global economy—$28 trillion. When women are more prosperous, then families, communities, and countries are all more prosperous as well.\nMy meeting yesterday with my fellow leaders of the Trans-Pacific Partnership was a chance to reaffirm our commitment to the TPP, with its high standards, strong protections for workers, the environment, intellectual property, and human rights. Our partners made very clear during the meeting that they want to move forward with TPP. Preferably, they'd like to move forward with the United States. A number of countries are already starting to ratify TPP.\nAt the same time, we're already hearing calls for a less ambitious trade agreement in the region with lower standards, lower protections for workers, lower protections for the environment. That kind of agreement would obviously exclude U.S. workers and businesses and access to those markets. So, for all those reasons, I believe that TPP is a plus for America's economy, America's workers, American jobs. I think not moving forward would undermine our position across the region and our ability to shape the rules of global trade in a way that reflects our interests and our values. Finally, our cooperation with APEC has been critical to our historic progress in fighting climate change: bringing the Paris Agreement into force, agreeing to limit aviation emissions, phrasing out dangerous HFCs. Here in Lima, we continue our work to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, and countries made new commitments toward our goal of doubling our renewable energy over the next two decades.\nSo, as I wrap up my last summit and likely my last foreign trip as President, I could not be more proud of the progress that we've made together. Obviously, the work is never done. And given the prosperity and security we seek for not only the United States, but our allies and our partners, I continue to believe that America will have a vital role to play in creating and sustaining a strong, enduring leadership role in the Asia Pacific.\nSo, with that, let me take some questions. And I'll start with Darlene Superville of AP.\nPresident-Elect Donald J. Trump/President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia/Cybersecurity/2016 Presidential Election\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. You've been telling world leaders this week that President-elect Trump is unlikely to govern in the divisive way that he campaigned. But I'm wondering, how can you be so certain of that given that the first group of people he's chosen for top national security and law enforcement positions hold the same views that he espoused as a candidate? And second, to follow up on your meeting earlier today with President Putin, did you discuss with him Russia's alleged meddling in the U.S. election? And are you concerned that the kind of involvement that we saw in this year's campaign will be the new normal going forward in future U.S. elections?\nThe President. Good. Well, what I have said to world leaders is the same thing that I've said in a number of press conferences, which is the President-elect now has to put together a team and put forward specifics about how he intends to govern. And he hasn't had a full opportunity to do that yet. And so people should take a wait-and-see approach in how much his policy proposals once in the White House, once he is sworn in, matches up with some of the rhetoric of his campaign.\nMy simple point is, is that you can't assume that the language of campaigning matches up with the specifics of governing, legislation, regulations, and foreign policy.\nI can't be sure of anything. I think, like everyone else, we'll have to wait and see. But as I've said before, once you're in the Oval Office, once you begin interacting with world leaders, once you see the complexities of the issues, that has a way of shaping your thinking and, in some cases, modifying your thinking, because you recognize this solemn responsibility not only to the American people, but the solemn responsibility that America has as the largest, most powerful country in the world.\nAnd I can't guarantee that the President-elect won't pursue some of the positions that he's taken. But what I can guarantee is, is that reality will force him to adjust how he approaches many of these issues. That's just the way this office works.\nAnd I've said before, if these issues were easy—if ensuring prosperity, jobs, security, good foreign relations with other countries—if all that was simple, then it would have been done by every previous President. And I'm a pretty good Presidential historian. I've looked at my 43 predecessors, and it seems like for all of them—even the best ones—that you end up confronting realities that you didn't anticipate. I think the same will happen here. And that's a good thing. That's an important thing. With respect to President Putin, I didn't have a meeting. We talked briefly while we were in between sessions. And the conversation that I had with him was consistent with the conversations I've had with him over the previous several months, indicating to him that we are still deeply concerned about the bloodshed and chaos that's being sown by constant bombing attacks by Asad and the Russian military against populations in Aleppo and the need for us to arrive first at some sort of humanitarian cease-fire and begin moving towards a political transition of some sort.\nAnd I talked to him about Ukraine and the need for us to get Minsk done. I urged him to instruct his negotiators to work with ourselves, with France, with Germany, with Ukraine to see if we can get that done before my term is up. As usual, it was a candid and courteous meeting, but very clear about the strong differences that we have on policy.\nThe issue of the elections did not come up because that's behind us and I was focused in this brief discussion on moving forward. I had already made very clear to him our concerns around cyber attacks, generally, as well as specific concerns we had surrounding the DNC hack.\nI don't think this will be the norm, but as I've said before, the concern I have has less to do with any particular misinformation or propaganda that's being put out by any particular party, and a greater concern about the general misinformation from all kinds of sources—both domestic, foreign, on social media—that make it very difficult to voters—for voters to figure out what's true and what's not. And let me put it this way. I think if we have a strong, accurate, and responsible press, and we have a strong, civic culture and an engaged citizenry, then various attempts to meddle in our elections won't mean much.\nIf, generally, we've got elections that aren't focused on issues and are full of fake news and false information and distractions, then the issue is not going to be what's happening from the outside. The issue is going to be what are we doing to ourselves from the inside. The good news is that's something that we have control over. All right?\nGardiner Harris [New York Times].\nThe President's Personal Finances/Government Ethics/President-Elect Donald J. Trump/National Security Agency/Cybersecurity\nQ. Mr. President, thank you so much for holding this press conference. If you had had hotels, real estate, and other businesses distributed around the world prior to becoming President, would you have thought it appropriate to sell them off and put the cash proceeds in a blind trust? Or is it okay for the President of the United States to be personally vulnerable to the policy decisions of the foreign leaders he meets and in the foreign policy decisions he makes as President? And also, just briefly, what's your complaint about how the NSA and Cyber Command have done their job? And are you considering firing Admiral Mike Rogers?\nThe President. That was a rhetorical question, that first one. [Laughter]\nQ. I'm hoping that you give us some sense of your beliefs.\nThe President. Rather than comment on hypotheticals, let me say specifically what I did.\nQ. Okay.\nThe President. Obviously, my assets were significantly smaller than some other Presidents or President-elects. But we made a decision to liquidate assets that might raise questions about how it would influence policy. I basically had our accountant put all our money in Treasury bills—the yields, by the way, have not been massive over the course of the last 8 years—[laughter]—just because it simplified my life. I did not have to worry about the complexities of whether a decision that I made might even inadvertently benefit me.\nAnd that's consistent with the broader approach that we've taken throughout my administration, which is to not just meet the letter of the law, but to go well beyond the letter to the spirit of the law, not just for me, but for the people in the White House and in our leadership positions.\nWe have established a whole set of rules, norms, playbooks that just keep us far away from the line. Early on in the administration, there would be questions about, could a staff person go to this conference or what should they do about this gift that was provided? And I think it was maybe our first General Counsel who was responsible for setting up our guidelines and rules inside the White House that said, if it sounds like it would be fun, then you can't do it. [Laughter] That's a general test. If it sounds like something you would enjoy or appreciate, no-go.\nAnd as a consequence—and I'll knock on some wood here, because we've got 2 months left—I am extremely proud of the fact that over 8 years we have not had the kinds of scandals that have plagued other administrations. And when I met with the President-elect, I suggested to him that having a strong White House Counsel that could provide clear guideposts and rules would benefit him and benefit his team because it would eliminate a lot of ambiguity. And I think it will be up to him to make determinations about how he wants to approach it.\nI know what worked for us, and I think it served the American people well. And because I had made a promise to the American people that I would not fall into some of the familiar habits of Washington, that I wanted a new kind of politics, this was one indicator. And at the end of 8 years, I think I can say to the American people I delivered on that commitment.\nWith respect to cyber, the NSA, Admiral Rogers is a terrific patriot and has served this country well in a number of positions. I generally don't comment on personnel matters here. I can say generally that we've spent a lot of time over the last several years looking at how we can organize our cyber efforts to keep pace with how rapidly the environment is changing.\nIncreasingly, our critical infrastructure, government data, financial systems are vulnerable to attack. And both state and non-state actors are getting better and better at it, and it is becoming more and more rapid. And it is inevitable that we're going to have to modernize and update not just the tools we use to defend those assets and the American people, but also how we organize it. And it is true that we are exploring a range of options in terms of how we organize the mission that currently exists.\nRich Edson [Fox News].\n2016 Presidential Election/Democratic Party/U.S. Electoral System/Former President George W. Bush/The President's Post-Presidency Plans\nQ. Good evening, and thank you, Mr. President.\nThe President. Yes.\nQ. Earlier this year, former President George W. Bush reportedly said that he warned, he would be the last Republican President. Now Republicans have won the White House, control the House and Senate, two-thirds of State legislatures, 34 Governorships, and there are charges of a shallow Democratic bench behind you. Are you worried you could be the last Democratic President for a while? And secondly, sir, speaking of your predecessor, he made sure to offer essentially no public criticism of you during your time in office. Will you equally withhold public criticism for President Trump, even if he attempts to dismantle much of what you've accomplished? Thank you.\nThe President. Well, no, I'm not worried about being the last Democratic President. I think——\nQ. But for a while?\nThe President. Or not even for a while. And I say that not being cute. The Democratic nominee won the popular vote, and obviously, this was an extremely competitive race, and I would expect that future races will be competitive as well. I certainly think it's true that politics in America right now are a little up for grabs, that some of the old alignments within both parties—Democrat and Republican—are being reshaped. And although the results of this election involved some of the specifics of the candidates and aren't going to be duplicated in every subsequent election, Democrats do have to do some thinking about, how do we make sure that the message we have is received effectively and results in winning elections?\nThis is something that I've been wrestling with throughout my Presidency. When you look at the proposals I put forward, they garner majority support. The majority believes in raising the minimum wage. The majority believes in commonsense gun safety rules. The majority believes in investing to rebuild our infrastructure and create jobs. The majority believes in making sure that people aren't going bankrupt when they get sick. The majority agrees with all the individual components of Obamacare. [Laughter]\nI think there was a Gallup Poll this week, subsequent to the election, that showed that the general public has a more favorable view of Democrats than Republicans. And as I noted, my approval ratings are quite high. And yet what's been true during the course of my 8 years is that, that does not always translate. In fact, too often, it hasn't translated into working majorities either at the State level or at the Federal level.\nNow, some of that is just the nature of our system and geography. Right? As long as Wyoming gets the same number of Senators as California, there's going to be some tilt towards Republicans when it comes to congressional races. The fact that a lot of Democratic voters are bunched up in big cities and a lot of Republican voters are spread out across geography gives them an advantage when it comes to congressional races.\nSome of it is just political bad luck. For example, I came in as an economy was in free fall, and although we took the right steps to save the economy, in my midterm election in 2010, people couldn't yet see the recovery, and not surprisingly, the President's party got punished. We lost control of a lot of not just congressional seats, but also gubernatorial seats and State legislative seats. And that happened to be the year that the census is done and you start doing redistricting, and those Republicans took advantage of political gerrymandering to lock in majorities, even though in numerous subsequent elections, Democrats have actually cast more votes—or more votes have been cast for Democratic congressional candidates than Republican. And yet you end up having large Republican majorities.\nSo there are just some structural problems that we have to deal with. But look, you can't make excuses about the rules. That's the deal, and we've got to do better. And I think doing better, as I said, involves us working at the grassroots, not ceding territory. Going out into areas where right now we may not stand a chance of actually winning, but we're building up a cadre of young talent. We're making arguments. We're persuading. We're talking about the things that matter to ordinary people day to day and trying to avoid some of the constant distractions that fill up people's Twitter accounts.\nAnd if we do that, then I'm confident that we'll be back on track. I don't think that there has to be a complete overhaul here. I think that there does have to be better organization, a smarter message. And one message I do have for Democrats is that a strategy that's just microtargeting particular, discrete groups in a Democratic coalition sometimes will win you elections, but it's not going to win you the broad mandate that you need. And ultimately, the more we can talk about what we have in common as a nation and speak to a broad set of values, a vision that speaks to everybody and not just one group at a time, the better off we're going to be.\nI think that's part of the reason why I was able to get elected twice, is that I always tried to make sure that, not only in proposals, but also in message, that I was speaking to everybody.\nYou had a second part to your question?\nQ. As for criticism of your successor?\nThe President. Ah. Look, I've said before, President Bush could not have been more gracious to me when I came in. And my intention is to, certainly for the next 2 months, just finish my job. And then, after that, to take Michelle on vacation—[laughter]—get some rest, spend time with my girls, and do some writing, do some thinking. So I want to be respectful of the office and give the President-elect an opportunity to put forward his platform and his arguments without somebody popping off in every instance.\nAs an American citizen who cares deeply about our country, if there are issues that have less to do with the specifics of some legislative proposal or battle, but go to core questions about our values and our ideals, and if I think that it's necessary or helpful for me to defend those ideals, then I'll examine it when it comes. But what I do know is, is that I have to take Michelle on vacation. [Laughter]\nJuliet. Juliet Eilperin [Washington Post].\nThe President's Executive Authority/Syria/Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) Terrorist Organization\nQ. Thanks, Mr. President. Given what you just said about the strong differences that you and President Putin have on the future of Syria and the conflict there, can you talk a little about how you see that unfolding, both at the end of your tenure, at the beginning of Donald Trump's, and whether you have concerns that even if we eliminate the Islamic State in eastern Syria and western Iraq, we may be allowing a permanent Al Qaida safe haven around Aleppo and Idlib? And on Aleppo, can you say to what extent you think the United States has fulfilled its responsibility to protect in that instance?\nAnd then, in terms of finishing your job, which you just mentioned, in the last week, you exercised your executive authority on multiple fronts: finalizing oil and gas leasing rules on public lands as well as issuing a 5-year leasing plan banning drilling in the Arctic and the Atlantic. Many Republicans say that you should hold off finalizing anymore rules as you're headed out the door because they oppose many of them and will seek to overturn them when they control both the executive and the legislative branch next year. What do you say to that suggestion? The President. Well, on the second question, these are the same Republicans who suggested that they didn't need to confirm a Supreme Court Justice when I was 9 months out, until the next election. I think their general approach seems to be that probably 2 days after my reelection, I should stop until the next election. I don't think that that's what the Constitution calls for.\nThe regulations that we have issued are ones that we've been working on for a very long time. They've been subject to extensive public notice and comment, and everybody has known they've been out there. These aren't things that we've been surprising people with. They're well considered, they're the right thing to do. They're part of my task of finishing my work.\nAnd I recognize that when the new administration comes in and a new Congress comes in, that they will have the option of trying to undo some of those rules and regulations that we've put into place. And that's their prerogative. That's part of how democracy works. But I feel very strongly these are the right things to do, and I'm going to make sure I do them.\nWith respect to Syria, as I said, I think, even on this trip in a previous press conference, I am not optimistic about the short-term prospects in Syria. Once Russia and Iran made a decision to back Asad in a brutal air campaign and essentially a pacification of Aleppo, regardless of the potential for civilian casualties, children being killed or wounded, schools or hospitals being destroyed, then it was very hard to see a way in which even a trained and committed moderate opposition could hold its ground for long periods of time.\nAnd the issue that obviously I've wrestled with for the last 5 years: How involved should the United States be? What are our legal constraints in such involvement? What are our moral obligations? What are our strategic interests? Those haven't changed. I continue to believe that we did not have a legal basis for military intervention there; that it would have been a strategic mistake given the work we still had to do in Iraq, the counter-ISIL campaign, ongoing operations in Afghanistan that we have worked tirelessly to arrive at a political transition of some sort and that could alleviate the suffering and provide humanitarian access. And we will continue to do that work all the way until the last day that me and John Kerry and others have the authority to speak for the United States Government.\nBut ultimately, it takes two—or in this case, four or six or eight—to tango. And we're just not getting help or interest from those parties that are supporting Asad, and Asad, as a consequence, has been emboldened. Look, this is a man who has decided that destroying his country, turning it to rubble, and seeing its population scattered or killed was worth it for him to cling to power when he had the option to peacefully engage in a transition that could have kept the country intact. That's his mentality. That's not a mentality we support. That's a mentality that the Russians and the Iranians have been willing to support. But at this stage, we're going to need to have a change in how all parties think about this in order for us to end the situation there.\nNow, our ability to go after ISIL, I think, can be sustained. There's no doubt that there will continue to be extremist forces in and around Syria because it's still going to be in chaos for quite some time. There will be elements in Iraq, just as there have been elements in Afghanistan even after the Taliban we're swept out, even after we killed bin Laden. But I think we can effectively reduce the risk and take their key external operators off the field.\nThe thing I'm probably most concerned about is making sure that even as we do that, U.S. policy, U.S. statements, U.S. positions don't further radicalize Muslims around the world or alienate and potentially radicalized law-abiding Muslims who are living in Europe or the United States. And that's why I think it's important for us to understand those are our key allies in this fight, not enemies.\nMike Memoli [Los Angeles Times].\nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi/Democratic Party/U.S. Presidency/U.S. Foreign Policy\nQ. Thank you, Mr. President. This final foreign trip of your Presidency is obviously playing out in very different circumstances than you might have expected. A very different transition is underway than the one you might have envisioned. Given that, though, I wonder if you've intentionally sought to approach this trip reflecting more on the powers of and influence of the Presidency on the world stage so that you might be able to offer the kind of counsel to your successor that he has said he hopes to draw upon.\nAnd also, on a political note, you talked often during your reelection campaign about this fever that had consumed the Republican Party, an effective political strategy that they employed to block you even on issues where there might have been some common ground.\nThe President. Right.\nQ. What would be your advice to Democrats who might see that kind of strategy as the same kind of path to taking back power that the Republicans employed? And related to that, what would your advice be to House Democrats about whether or not to reelect Nancy Pelosi as the party leader in the House?\nThe President. Well, I'll work in reverse. I think Nancy Pelosi is an outstanding and historic political leader. So much of what we accomplished was accomplished because of her smarts, her tenacity, her legislative skill. And I don't normally meddle with party votes, and certainly on my way out the door, probably, I shouldn't meddle here. But I cannot speak highly enough of Nancy Pelosi. She combines strong, progressive values with just extraordinary political skill. And she does stuff that's tough, not just stuff that's easy. She's done stuff that's unpopular in her own base because it's the right thing to do for the American people. I think she's a remarkable leader.\nWith respect to Democrats and Republicans and how Democrats should deal with a new administration, I think you give them a hearing. I certainly don't want them to do what Mitch McConnell did when I was elected: meet the day of and say our sole objective is to not cooperate with him on anything even if the country is about to go into a depression so that we can gain seats in the midterms and ultimately defeat him.\nThat's not why the American people send us to Washington, to play those games. So that's not my advice to Democrats. My advice to Democrats is, know what you care about and what you stand for, and fight for your principles even if it's a hard fight. If there are areas where the new administration is doing something that's going to be good for the American people, find a way to work with them. If you think it's going to be a problem, then say so and make the argument.\nThe touchstone is, what's good for the American people. And that's worked for me. It means that at the end of the day—and at the end of 8 years—I can look back, and I can say that I consistently did what I thought was best. It doesn't mean you don't make mistakes, but it means that you're being true to your oath and the commitments you made to the people who elected you. And in terms of reflecting on the U.S. Presidency as I've been traveling, I think the main reflection I have and the main advice that I give to the incoming President is, the United States really is an indispensable nation in our world order. And I say that as somebody who has gone out of his way to express respect for every country and its people and to consistently acknowledge that many of the challenges that we face are not challenges that America can solve on its own. But what I also know is that the basic framework of the world order coming out of World War II and then on through the end of the cold war was shaped by a set of ideals and principles that have worked for the vast majority of people, not just America, but around the world. The notion of democracy and rule of law and a free press and an independent judiciary and open markets and a social welfare state to moderate some off the sharp edges of capitalism and lifting up issues of human rights and investing in public health and development—not just within our own borders, but elsewhere in the world—and working with multilateral institutions like the United Nations, making sure that we're upholding international norms and rules.\nThat's what's made the modern world. And there have been times where we, ourselves, have not observed some of these norms as well as we should and have been accused of hypocrisy. Here in Latin America, there have been times where countries felt disrespected and, on occasion, had cause for that. There are times where we haven't observed these values in our own country and have fallen short of our ideals. But that basic structure is the reason why the world is much wealthier, much more secure, and, yes, less violent, healthier, better educated, more tolerant than it was 50 years ago.\nAnd that requires constant work. It doesn't just happen on its own. I've said this in Europe. I've said this in places where there's this pushback against this modern order. But you take an example like Europe, before that order was imposed, we had two world wars in the span of 30 years. In the second one, 60 million people were killed. Not half a million, not a million, but 60 million. Entire continents in rubble.\nIn places like Asia—the Asia-Pacific, before that order existed, you routinely saw famines of millions of people, not just concerns about low wages, but people dying because they didn't have any food or drinking water or died of cholera or simple diseases—if somebody had some penicillin.\nAnd so what I would say would be that we all share responsibilities for improving that order and maintaining it and making sure it's more inclusive and delivers greater hope and prosperity for more corners of the world. We all have responsibilities—every nation—in respecting the dignity and worth of their citizens. And America can't do it all for everybody else. There are limits to our reach into other countries if they're determined to oppress their people or not provide girls education or siphon off development funds into Swiss bank accounts because they're corrupt. We're not going to be able to handle every problem.\nBut the American President and the United States of America—if we're not on the side of what's right, if we're not making the argument and fighting for it, even if sometimes we're not able to deliver it a hundred percent everywhere—then it collapses. And there's nobody to fill the void. There really isn't. There are other very important countries, like a China, where we can't—if it weren't for China's cooperation, we couldn't have gotten the Paris Agreement done. But China is not the one who was going around organizing 200 nations to sign on to a Paris Agreement or putting together the paper and the policy outlines and the conceptual framework. Russia is a very significant military power, but they're not worrying right now about how to rebuild after a hurricane in Haiti. We are.\nAnd I've said before, that's a burden that we should carry proudly. And I would hope that not just the 45th President of the United States, but every President of the United States understands that that's not only a burden, but it's also an extraordinary privilege. And if you have a chance to do that right, then you should seize it.\nAll right? Thank you, everybody.", "timestamp": "2016-11-20", "title": "The President's News Conference in Lima, Peru"}

Truly great and talented men and women, patriots indeed are being brought in and many will soon be a part of our government, helping us to Make America Great Again.\nMy agenda will be based on a simple core principle: putting America First.\nWhether it's producing steel, building cars, or curing disease, I want the next generation of production and innovation to happen right here, in our great homeland: America – creating wealth and jobs for American workers.\nAs part of this plan, I've asked my transition team to develop a list of executive actions we can take on day one to restore our laws and bring back our jobs. It's about time.\nThese include the following:\nOn trade, I am going to issue our notification of intent to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a potential disaster for our country. Instead, we will negotiate fair, bilateral trade deals that bring jobs and industry back onto American shores.\nOn energy, I will cancel job-killing restrictions on the production of American energy – including shale energy and clean coal – creating many millions of high-paying jobs. That's what we want, that's what we've been waiting for.\nOn regulation, I will formulate a rule which says that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated, it's so important.\nOn national security, I will ask the Department of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to develop a comprehensive plan to protect America's vital infrastructure from cyber-attacks, and all other form of attacks.\nOn immigration, I will direct the Department of Labor to investigate all abuses of visa programs that undercut the American worker.\nOn ethics reform, as part of our plan to Drain the Swamp, we will impose a five-year ban on executive officials becoming lobbyists after they leave the Administration – and a lifetime ban on executive officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government.\nThese are just a few of the steps we will take to reform Washington and rebuild our middle class.\nI will provide more updates in the coming days, as we work together to Make America Great Again for everyone.", "timestamp": "2016-11-21", "title": "A Video Message from President-Elect Donald J.

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119737", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n12:19 P.M. EST\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Nice to see you all. Those of you who joined us on the trip, welcome back. Hopefully you've gotten a chance to catch up on some sleep. Maybe a little. Maybe that's what the Thanksgiving holiday will be, at least in part, of that. I don't have any announcements at the top, so we can go straight to your questions.\nJosh, do you want to start?\nQ: Sure. Thanks, Josh. Has the President spoken to the President-elect since their meeting in the Oval Office shortly after the election?\nMR. EARNEST: Josh, I know this has come up in some reporting about an off-the-record meeting that the President-elect reportedly held with some media executives in New York yesterday. What I can tell you is that those of you who covered the President-elect's visit to the Oval Office a couple of weeks ago, you took note of the fact that the President-elect indicated his desire to continue to consult with President Obama over the course of the transition. And you've also heard President Obama indicate the high priority that he has placed on facilitating a smooth and effective transition. So reports the two may have talked after their White House meeting I think are not particularly surprising.\nBut in the same way that I protected the ability of President Obama to consult confidentially with other senior officials, including some former Presidents, I'm not going to read out or confirm every reported meeting or phone call or conversation. But I can tell you that the President has had a conversation with the President-elect since the Oval Office meeting.\nQ: But, Josh, when the President speaks to other important world leaders, a number of them from Congress or congressional leadership, they're able to have private discussions where they can confer on things, and the White House at least is able to confirm when they spoke and usually give us some type of a general readout of what they discussed. Is there a reason that that can't take place?\nMR. EARNEST: That hasn't been true when President Obama has consulted with other Presidents. And I think that's the precedent -- and precedent prerogative that we're trying to protect. But again, as President-elect Trump indicated in the Oval Office, he was hoping that he would have the opportunity to consult with President Obama over the course of this transition. President Obama has committed to a smooth transition, and as a result they've spoken at least once since their Oval Office meeting.\nQ: Is the White House hoping that Trump and his team will be similarly coy in not releasing a whole lot of details about what the two Presidents discussed?\nMR. EARNEST: President-elect Trump can certainly discuss whatever he chooses to about his consultations with President Obama. Presumably, he'll have an opportunity to do that beyond an off-the-record meeting with news executives.\nQ: You may have seen that the President-elect -- his team, at least, is now saying that he won't go ahead and try to prosecute Hillary Clinton, if elected -- or once he takes office. Is the White House relieved to hear that that seems to be off the table? Or are you concerned that the independence between the White House and the Justice Department that you've worked so dutifully over the last eight years to try to maintain now seems to be going out the window?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Josh, I think the end of your question is where I would begin, which is that we have gone to great lengths in the context of the Obama administration to uphold a core foundational principle of our democracy, which is preventing politics from influencing independent criminal investigations. That is a basic principle of our democracy because we don't want to leave anybody with even the impression that there's the potential that somebody could be treated differently by our criminal justice system because of their political affiliation. This is a principle of every American being subject to the rule of law and every American being equal under the law.\nAnd so we have gone to great lengths not just to uphold that principle but also to even avoid the appearance of that principle being called into question. And for better or worse, in the context of the two and a half years that I've been doing this job, I've been asked repeatedly -- even before Secretary Clinton had announced her campaign, I was asked about her email system. Eight days before an election, I came out and stood before all of you, answering questions about a letter from the FBI Director that he had sent to Congress saying that the investigation had been reopened.\nAnd at each of those turns, I've made clear that those kinds of investigative decisions and investigative conclusions should be conducted free of any sort of political interference and certainly should be conducted independent of any White House interference. And that's the principle that we have protected. That is a principle that previous Presidents have protected. And we certainly believe that's a principle that future Presidents should protect.\nBut again, I can't speak for the President-elect's team or any sort of decisions or pronouncements that he'd like to make. You'd have to talk to him about that.\nQ: And I wanted to ask you about the President-elect publicly lobbying for Britain to nominate Nigel Farage as the UK Ambassador to the U.S. Is the White House concerned by that apparently pretty significant breach of protocol, given his status as the political opposition to the current leadership in the UK?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Josh, as somebody who has covered the President closely for the last several years, you know that the President has been very conscientious about not wading too deeply into another country's politics. The truth is there's plenty of politics going on in this country to keep everybody busy, I think.\nSo there have been occasions where the President has taken a position on a particular issue, or at least spoken publicly about a particular issue. The Brexit question comes to mind. A lot of people made note of the President's public statements about the Brexit vote when he visited the UK earlier this year. But he was quite direct in laying out his view that this was a decision for the British people to make.\nBut he offered his opinion for a couple of reasons. First of all, he saw some of the opponents of Brexit suggest that somehow the United States would benefit or have a favorable view of a Brexit vote. That was obviously not true, so the President wanted to set the record straight. The President also thought it was important for people to understand the true feelings of the UK's closest ally as they weighed this decision that was before them. And so the President made the argument accordingly. But at each turn in making that argument, he went to great lengths to make clear that he respects the sovereignty of the British people and certainly respects the responsibility that the British people and the British government have to make decisions that are consistent with their own country's and their own citizens' self-interest.\nAnd that's a principle that -- that's another principle that we've sought to uphold during the President's eight years in office. You have to talk to the President-elect or the people of the UK about whether or not they are concerned that that tweet may have violated that principle. It's not something I'll weigh in on from here.\nJulia. Nice to see you.\nQ: Hi, good to see you. I wanted to ask you a few questions about President-elect Trump's recent comments on immigration. Yesterday, in a YouTube video outlining executive actions he hopes to take as soon as he gets into office, he said that he was going to call on the Department of Labor to investigate all abuses of visa programs that undercut American workers. Does the President have a response to this? Does he think that visa abuse by American companies is on the rise? And does he support an approach that would investigate, piece by piece, each abuse?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, over the course of the election, I think we made, and the President made, very clear -- even to people who were only sort of paying attention -- that the President-elect's vision for the domestic and foreign policy he chose to -- he hopes to pursue is quite different than the priorities and agenda that President Obama has said over his last eight years in office. So it shouldn't be surprising that a number of the priorities that the President-elect has discussed are not the same priorities that we've been discussing.\nBut for me to weigh in on and react to or even criticize those well-known differences would undermine the President's priority of ensuring a smooth and effective transition.\nSo it's certainly the responsibility of the President-elect to communicate with the American public about what sort of priorities he'll pursue when he takes office. He has that right and ability because he won the election. And the election is over. The debate about the consequences of that election has been resolved. And the President is following the will of the American people and fulfilling his institutional responsibility to give the incoming team the best prospects for success when it comes to uniting the country and moving us forward.\nQ: An area where there may be some overlap or he may be able to comment would be on the President-elect's plan to unravel the executive actions on immigration, like the DACA --the DREAMER's Act that allowed children who were brought to the U.S. by their parents work authorizations. Obviously, it was a big push of this administration to get those people to give their information to the government, to come forward. That information will now be put in the hands of an administration who could use that for enforcement -- things like addresses. What does the President say now to reassure or to provide some comfort to people who he convinced to trust the government enough to come forward and share that information?\nMR. EARNEST: I know the President has had an opportunity to talk about this a little bit already. I think what I would say in general is that this does underscore the need for Congress to act on the clear bipartisan agreement that exists about some of the benefits of comprehensive immigration reform. The obstruction by House Republicans prevented the realization of that goal. And ultimately, House Republicans who continue to retain their responsibility for governing the country with their majorities in Congress will have to evaluate whether or not they want this country to enjoy the significant economic benefits of common-sense comprehensive immigration reform.\nThe second thing I would note is that the President-elect, since the election, has given voice to the same kind of priorities and criteria that this administration has long pursued. The President-elect has indicated that his emphasis when it comes to deportation should be on criminals. That's actually the policy that this administration has been pursuing for quite some time. That is a policy that we turbocharged in the context of the President's executive actions that were announced a little over two years ago now.\nSo ultimately it will be the responsibility of the President-elect, though, to determine what sort of priorities his administration will pursue. The kind of enforcement priorities that are laid out in the context of the DREAMers executive action that was taken by the administration was actually something that largely rested with the Department of Homeland Security. So certainly the President-elect's choice for the Secretary of Homeland Security will be a consequential one.\nBut ultimately the President has made clear that those individuals who qualified for DACA, the DREAM Act executive actions that this administration pursued, are individuals who are in the United States through no fault of their own. These are individuals who are American in every way but their papers. And these are individuals who attend the same church, attend the same school, shop at the same stores, live in the same communities as Americans all across the country.\nAnd our country benefits from making an investment in those young people, because those young people made an investment in us, and many of them have gone to college and demonstrated the kind of entrepreneurial spirit that's good for our economy. Many of them have actually enlisted our military and fought and died protecting the United States of America and the people who live here.\nSo there's a strong case to make about the valuable contribution that these individuals have already made to the United States, and a strong case has been made about how unraveling them and dividing families in the way that some suggest would be bad for our economy and entirely inconsistent with the kinds of values that have long been revered by American policymakers for generations.\nQ: One last question. Will the President withdraw Merrick Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, the President believes strongly that Chief Judge Garland is the best person in America to fill a vacancy in the Supreme Court. That's why the President nominated him. Presumably, there are some Republicans who agree. They agree for a variety of reasons. They agree in part because Chief Judge Garland is the most experienced Supreme Court nominee in American history. He spent 19 years on the federal judiciary. And no one can call into his question his qualifications. Certainly the nonpartisan American Bar Association didn't call into question his qualifications. They rated him unanimously well-qualified for the job. You had Republicans who in the past had described Chief Judge Garland as a consensus nominee, as somebody who is going to set aside his own political leanings and focus on the judges' responsibility to interpret the law.\nBut Merrick Garland is also somebody who has bravely served his country. He led the investigation into the bombing in Oklahoma City and played a key role in bringing to justice those who killed more than 100 Americans in Oklahoma City more than 20 years ago now.\nSo Chief Judge Garland is somebody who is qualified. He's a man of impeccable character. And he's a man who served his country. And it is disgraceful the way that Republicans in the United States Senate treated him, even setting aside their absolute failure to fulfill their basic responsibility as elected officials, as elected representatives of the American people in the United States Senate.\nSo this is a -- his treatment and the way that this situation is likely to end is a scar on the institution of the United States Senate. And it is a scar that I do not anticipate will go away quickly, and that is rather unfortunate. But you can certainly be sure that President Obama will continue to have Chief Judge Garland's back until the end of this congressional session.\nJustin.\nQ: I wanted to ask -- you talked a lot about ensuring a smooth transition and helping the President-elect. In his video yesterday, he said on day one he would signal his intention to withdraw from TPP. I'm wondering for you guys, do you still plan to submit a final statement in the draft of the implementing bill to Congress? Or is your support for TPP at this point academic, with the realization that there's no interest on Capitol Hill and certainly not for the President-elect?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we certainly -- we're well aware of the public statements of the President-elect. And this is true of both candidates, that neither of them was supportive of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nI don't have any future steps to preview for you, but I would acknowledge that the prospects of TPP being ratified by this Congress or before President Obama leaves are not very good. And that's unfortunate --\nQ: But, I guess, are you going to try? I mean, are you even going to --\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I don't have any steps to preview at this point. I think the argument that I would make is simply that this is -- if Congress does not move forward with ratifying the Trans-Pacific Partnership, it is a significant missed opportunity for the American people, in part because there were some pretty clear signals from other TPP countries that they actually intend to move forward, even if the United States does not. And that's going to put U.S. businesses and U.S. workers at a disadvantage.\nYou've got other countries with significant economies, and growing economies, where the United States already does business, but U.S. businesses and U.S. workers are going to be put at a disadvantage because we don't benefit from the kinds of opportunities that are created by the TPP. You will see other countries who are part of TPP move in and capitalize on the market share that U.S. companies have lost in the Asia Pacific. And that's a real shame. Because so much of the anxiety that was, according to many analysts, expressed in the context of the election was rooted in the idea that the forces of globalization had had a negative impact on too many American workers. And those workers were frustrated that their government hadn't done more to help them and their companies counter those forces of globalization.\nThat's exactly the strategy that we have laid out. And it's tragic to see that be rolled back, to see that that policy that could address some of those concerns be rolled back by the person who claims that they share those concerns. So that's deeply disappointing.\nThis is also concerning when you consider our broader relationship with China -- because we know that right now, even as we speak, China is seeking to advance their own trade agreement with countries in this region that we know is going to further disadvantage U.S. businesses and U.S. workers.\nSo it is not a situation, Justin, where Congress refusing to advance the TPP, that the status quo is maintained and that we're just going to try and find a different solution. The fact is, the U.S. will be consequentially negatively affected by the refusal of the Congress to ratify the TPP in terms of lost opportunities and lost market share, but also in terms of lower standards being implemented by China.\nThe last thing I'll say about this is there was some discussion in the most recent campaign about NAFTA and the need to improve NAFTA. That's exactly what the TPP would have done. It would have included some environmental and labor standards that would have been increased and made enforceable in the context of TPP. That was not true in NAFTA, and that potential improvement is also on the verge of being cast to the curb, if you will. And that's rather unfortunate, too.\nSo there are some significant lost opportunities. And it will be difficult, I think, for, frankly, Democrats and Republicans in Congress who opposed the TPP moving forward to justify this action and to lay -- or inaction, as the case may be -- and to lay out some sort of coherent strategy for addressing these concerns. This administration pursued a coherent strategy. We worked for years to negotiate the kind of agreement that would advantage U.S. workers and our broader economy. But it looks like that responsibility may fall to someone else. I think they're going to have a hard time putting together the kind of coherent strategy with as much promise as the one that this administration put forward.\nQ: Gardiner asked the President about the NSA Director, down in Peru. But the President's answer was sort of broad, and so I wanted to kind of ask a couple tighter questions about --\nQ: You're saying I'm wrong?\nQ: No, I thought you did a good job there. (Laughter.)\nQ: Be specific. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Gardiner, would you like to sit up here and handle this one? I can take a break for a minute and you can --\nQ: Did the President receive a recommendation from Secretary Carter and DNI Clapper to remove Director Rogers? And has the President made the determination about whether there should be separate chains of command between the NSA and military cyber operations? And I say all this acknowledging that I'm probably not going to get more than Gardiner did. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: Fair enough. You wouldn't be doing your job if you didn't ask, and I wouldn't be doing my job if I gave up a whole lot more, particularly when it comes to something as critical to our national security as cybersecurity. This is something that I think was evident in the President's answer. This is something that the President has been thinking about a lot, about what we can do to enhance and further fortify the kinds of cyber protections that the American people and the U.S. government rely upon to ensure the protection of our national security.\nJustin, if the President was unwilling to describe the kind of advice and recommendations he's getting from his Secretary of Defense, it certainly would be out of line for me to do so. So I'm not going to talk about the kinds of advice or recommendations the President has received from the DNI or the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff or the Secretary of Defense.\nBut I can tell you that this is a question, more generally, about how to structure our national security apparatus that the President has been talking about with his team. As it relates to Admiral Rogers, you did hear directly from the President, I think in pretty unambiguous terms, how the President views Admiral Rogers as a patriot and somebody who had devoted a significant portion of his life to protecting our country. And I think all of us can and should be grateful for his service thus far.\nIf the President were to make a decision about changing the organization of this structure by dividing the responsibilities of the NSA Director and the Commander of Cyber Command into two different jobs, that's an announcement that I would let the Commander-in-Chief make.\nQ: Last one. All four major stock indices yesterday closed to record highs. I know that you don't comment on day-to-day fluctuations, but there has been sort of a decided uptick since President-elect Trump was elected. And so I'm wondering if you can maybe reflect on why investors might seem encouraged by the prospect of transitioning from an Obama economy to a Trump economy.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I typically am quite reluctant to talk about individual market movements, and I suspect there are plenty of analysts out there who have their own theories about market movements over the last couple of weeks. So I'll let those highly paid analysts do that work.\nI guess a market movement that I would comment on is just the market movement we've seen over the last eight years. Most of those stock indexes have more than doubled under President Obama's leadership, and I do think that that speaks well of the kind of economic strategy that President Obama has implemented. And it certainly will be a very high bar for a future President to live up to. But hopefully they'll give it a good shot.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, in your answer on Merrick Garland, does that mean that President Obama will resubmit the nomination in January during those days when the new Congress overlaps the end of his presidency?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have anything to preview at this point about whether or not the President would resubmit his nomination. But obviously the President I think shares my -- I'm confident shares my view that the Senate's treatment of Chief Judge Garland is deplorable.\nQ: Speaker Ryan today is urging President Obama not to put forward any steps that would bolster Iran's economies. He's worried that there may be new concessions in the pipeline. Does he have reason to worry?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have anything to preview at this point. What I can tell you is that this administration, through January 20th, will fulfill our obligations around the Iran deal that have prevented Iran from advancing their nuclear weapon capability. In fact, that capability has been substantially rolled back because of this international agreement that the United States brokered with some of our closest allies. And the results of the deal meant that Iran had to ship out 98 percent of its enriched uranium, had to dismantle two-thirds of their centrifuges -- thousands of centrifuges were dismantled. They had to render harmless their plutonium reactor. And they have adopted and complied with the most intrusive set of inspections that have ever been imposed by a country's nuclear program.\nSo the steps that have been taken thus far have enhanced the national security of the United States significantly. They've also enhanced the national security of our closest ally in the Middle East, Israel. And I can tell you that our other European allies in particular feel very good about the progress that this agreement has yielded. In fact, it has exceeded not just the expectations of those of us who believe that the Iran deal was the right approach, but it actually has refuted every criticism that we heard from opponents of the deal.\nThere was a suggestion at the very beginning that Iran would never ever sit down and negotiate this kind of an arrangement in good faith. Once those negotiations started, there was a sense that -- that was put forward by opponents of the deal -- that Iran wasn't actually interested in negotiating an agreement; that they were just negotiating for time. They were wrong about that too. Once the agreement was reached, critics said that the Iranians would never comply with the deal, they would never live up to the terms that had been included on the paper. They were wrong about that. Even the Israeli military intelligence community that had significant doubts about the deal have confirmed what we've seen from other places, which is that Iran has lived up to the terms of the deal.\nSo while Iran lives up to the terms of the deal, the United States is certainly going to make sure we're fulfilling our commitments to make sure that the deal doesn't fall apart. And we know that our allies -- the President had the opportunity to talk about this with some of the leaders of countries who also were a part of the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and they share that sentiment. The next administration will have to decide what they want to do moving forward, but the risks of pulling out of that agreement or doing something in violation of that agreement are grave.\nQ: The Speaker is also asking President Obama to sign a 10-year extension of the Iran sanctions pact. Is that something you'd be willing to do?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we know that there's been a robust debate in Congress about the wisdom of this approach. If there's a bill that's passed by the Congress, we'll obviously take a close look at it. I know much of the rhetoric on Capitol Hill is them -- advocates of the bill say that they want to give the President tools to impose sanctions against Iran where necessary.\nThe truth is, the Obama administration has significant authority to impose those kinds of financial penalties, and we have not been timid about using them. This administration has repeatedly, through the Treasury Department, imposed sanctions against Iran for a ballistic missile program that extends beyond the accepted guidelines of the international community. We've imposed sanctions against Iran because of their support for terrorism in the region. We have imposed sanctions against Iran because of their repeated and flagrant violation of universal human rights.\nSo these are tools that the administration already has, and we have certainly shown a willingness to use them. But if Congress wants to put more on the table, then we'll take a look at what they propose. We certainly are not going to, however, sign a piece of legislation that would undermine the ability of the international community to continue to successfully implement the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\nQ: And one last question on today's event. Can you tell us or remind us how President Obama selects the recipients of this Medal of Freedom?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I know that this is a process that was created by -- or an award that was created by President Kennedy. And the President every year looks forward to this opportunity that he has to acknowledge the contributions of people, mostly Americans, to the world and to the United States. And it's a rather distinguished group of individuals who are assembling in the East Room of the White House this afternoon to be recognized by the President with the highest civilian award that the President can offer.\nAnd these were individuals who were personally considered by the President. The President and his staff will spend some time considering a variety of candidates, but ultimately the President is the one who decides who is deserving of the award. And I think there's no arguing that the individuals who have been -- who will be recognized today are richly deserving.\nAndrew.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I wanted to go back to the question of Donald Trump's \"prosecution\" of Hillary Clinton. You spoke about upholding a core foundational principle of our democracy. Do you believe that the President-elect's comments and those of his staff risk eroding the core principle of democracy?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, there's ample opportunity for people to weigh in on this debate. And certainly many people -- Democrats and Republicans -- availed themselves of that opportunity in the two weeks leading up to the debate. I suspect that the comments today will give more people a reason to weigh in. But I'm not going to weigh in from here.\nI think the one thing that I don't think I mentioned in my previous answer to this that is relevant here is that there was an investigation. The investigation was led by independent officials at the Department of Justice, including the Director of the FBI. This is an individual who is a registered Republican. This is somebody who served as a high-ranking official in the Bush administration as a political appointee. He is somebody who was confirmed in the United States Senate by a majority of Democrats and a majority of Republicans when President Obama appointed him to the job.\nPresident Obama selected him for the job because of his demonstrated ability and his longstanding track record of putting aside his own political considerations to focus on the law. And his conclusion after the evidence was presented to him is that no reasonable prosecutor would move forward with the case. And he made that recommendation public. That is a recommendation that was then approved by senior officials at the Department of Justice, including the Attorney General, herself -- somebody with decades of experience in conducting criminal prosecutions.\nSo I guess the point, Andrew, is that we don't need staffers in the next White House to resolve the question about whether or not a prosecution should move forward. This decision was already reached by senior officials at the Department of Justice in a way that should resolve everybody's concerns about the potential for political interference. And it's important that this longstanding tradition and principle that is the foundation, or at least one critical part of the foundation of our criminal justice system is one that is not just upheld but one that is carefully protected, because its erosion has the potential to raise questions about whether or not everybody in this country is going to be treated fairly under the law.\nCheryl. Oh -- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off there.\nQ: No, no. What was I going to ask you -- the President has spoken quite a few times about the negative impact of partisanship and the need for reaching across the aisle. I was wondering if you think that Tulsi Gabbard's outreach to the Trump campaign offers a kind of example for Democrats in that regard.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I'm not going to comment on Congresswoman Gabbard's conversations. I mean, I think what I can tell you is that President Obama invited the President-elect to come to the Oval Office and meet with him. So at this point I don't think I have the standing to criticize anybody for having a meeting with the President-elect. I think the President was pretty blunt over the course of the last week when he was traveling in Europe and Latin America where he encouraged people in the United States and around the world to wait and see when it comes to assessing the pursuits of the next administration. And obviously I think that's what we'll all be doing.\nQ: Final one. Has the administration granted a license to Airbus to sell over a hundred planes to Iran?\nMR. EARNEST: I saw some of this reporting shortly before I came out here. I'd encourage you to check with my colleagues at the Treasury Department. That's the agency that handles those licenses and makes those decisions.\nCheryl.\nQ: I just need to know if the President would sign a short-term continuing resolution through March. Or how do you see the budget issue being resolved this year?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Cheryl, the approach that we have taken since the beginning is that the American people, the American government, and the American economy benefit from certainty. And one piece of certainty that the federal government owes the American people and the American economy is budget certainty. There's no reason that Congress shouldn't be able to fulfill their basic responsibility to provide an annual budget for the United States government and to do that on time, and to put forward a budget that is consistent with a set of principles about the best way to govern the country.\nSo we're going to continue to advocate for the longest possible budget agreement we can get. But ultimately the Congress is going to have to do a lot of negotiating here to figure out how they're going to uphold their basic responsibility, which is to keep the government open.\nQ: Republican leaders have said that they want to wait until the next administration comes in. Will you allow that to happen?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, we'll have to see what they put forward. I think this is one of those situations where, Cheryl, if you and I were negotiating this out, it would probably get resolved in about 90 minutes. But that's not the way that our system of democracy works. There are a much larger number of people involved. Some of them are, to be blunt about it, making decisions that are based on politics and not on the national interest. And that's unfortunate. And that makes the process imperfect, longer than necessary, and sometimes yields outcomes that are not in the best interest of the country, even if they are in the best interest of some individual members of Congress.\nSo we'll see to what extent politics infects this particular process. But that's something I can't judge in advance.\nDave.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. On that video announcement that President-elect Trump made last night he also mentioned the regulation -- his plan to undo two regulations, he said, for every new regulation that comes forward. Did the White House view that as a warning not to go forward with unfinished business?\nMR. EARNEST: No, not at all. In fact, this administration has actually pioneered a rather successful effort to do a review of preexisting regulations that were already on the books when President Obama took office. And we can follow up with you with some data that indicate the -- or that illustrate the economic impact -- the positive economic impact -- of that regulatory look-back proposal.\nThere are a substantial number of regulations that were taken off the books by the Obama administration in a way that had an important material benefit for the U.S. economy. So if the Trump administration is prepared to pursue the same kind of strategy, my guess is that they, I'm confident, that they will have -- they'll reach some different conclusions than we did. But that certainly is an entirely expected pursuit of theirs.\nQ: What's your view about his mathematical equation? I think he's looking for a twofer, basically, to undo -- just on the basis of math.\nMR. EARNEST: Again, the President spent a lot of time over the last week talking about how so much of governing may seem very simple on the surface, particularly when you're running for the job. It ends up being a lot more complicated once you get into the job and you evaluate the consequences for the actions that you are promising to take. I suspect that may be true in the context of the incoming administration's consideration of repealing a range of regulatory actions.\nMichelle. Oh, I'm sorry, Suzanne -- nice to see you. I'm used to Michelle sitting there. (Laughter.) And I saw you in the corner of my eye.\nQ: Thank you, Josh.\nMR. EARNEST: It's nice to see you today.\nQ: Nice to see you, as well. Can we go back to Iran?\nMR. EARNEST: Absolutely.\nQ: Is the administration considering any new measures to bolster the nuclear deal with Iran, namely through sanctions or additional licensing with American businesses in order to make it more difficult for a Trump administration to undo?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any actions to preview from here. The one thing I can confirm for you is that the kinds of actions that we have taken in implementing the deal are the kinds of actions that have had to go through a rather extended process. So I can confirm for you that I do not anticipate any actions being taken that were initiated after the election solely in response to Mr. Trump's victory.\nSo any actions that are taken, if there are any, are the kinds of actions that have been in the pipeline for quite some time and are entirely consistent with the United States upholding our end of an agreement that has prevented Iran from developing their nuclear weapon capability; in fact, has succeeded in rolling back Iran's weapon capability in a way that has exceeded the expectation of the deal's harshest critics, and enhanced the national security of the United States and our allies around the world.\nQ: Is the administration confident that the Trump team understands the role of Russia and China in terms of whether or not this is going to be dismantled or whether or not this is going to be renegotiated?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I think you'd have to ask them what their understandings are. But obviously -- and I think -- well, obviously we know that the kind of an agreement that was reached is not -- would not have been successful without the effective and constructive contributions of both the Russians and the Chinese. And I feel confident in telling you that if you ask them, their governments will confirm for you that they are pleased with the benefits that have been enjoyed by the international community as a result of the successful implementation of this agreement.\nQ: On another matter, the group called the National Policy Institute, a white supremacy group, held a meeting at the Reagan Building in which we heard chants -- neo-Nazi chants, \"Heil Trump!\" What is the administration's feeling or response, reaction to just, blocks away from the White House, that this is in the open? And I have a follow-up.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, for more than a year, you have heard me express some profound concern about the extreme rhetoric that has succeeded in infiltrating its way into our political process. That rhetoric is divisive. That rhetoric has been contrary to our values as Americans and deeply concerning, not just to people in the administration but to Democrats and Republicans all across the country.\nI saw some of the reporting about this meeting that took place while we were out of the country. I think what I would say is that the President's view is that it's not just the responsibility of people in elected office to speak out against that kind of divisive, hateful rhetoric. It's the responsibility of everybody who's blessed with American citizenship. We all have a responsibility to speak out and to stand up for our values, and to stand up for our fellow Americans. And that has been at the core of President Obama's career in public life.\nAs he said himself many times on the campaign trail, the slogan of his campaigns was not \"Yes, I can\" -- it was \"Yes, we can.\" And that was a nod to the collective responsibility that we all have as Americans to advance the interests of our country together; that change doesn't start from the top down -- it comes from the bottom up, and that all Americans have a responsibility to remain engaged in our democracy and to be vigilant in defending the kinds of values that have served our country so well for 240 years.\nAnd the President is optimistic that people of good faith and good will all across the country, even if they're in different parties, standing up against this kind of extremism and hate. And it is, after all, critical to the success of our country that we remember just how much we have in common. It's not everything -- and doesn't mean we should paper over the differences that we have, particularly in the political sphere. But at our core, we share a commitment to a set of values that were endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights, and that were all equal before the law, and that we're not going to be judged by the color of our skin or the way we worship God. We're going to be judged by our character. We're going to be judged by our patriotism. We're going to be judged by our contributions to this country. And those are principles that are worth defending. And the responsibility to defend those principles isn't just vested with people who are positions of authority. It's vested with every single person who lives in the United States of America.\nQ: President-elect Donald Trump denounced racism in general, but he did not specifically denounce these neo-Nazi chants. What is his responsibility?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I'll let the President-elect speak to this in the way that he believes is most appropriate. Again, it's not -- I don't think it's breaking news that people who serve in this administration have some significant differences with the style and tactics that were used by President-elect Trump in the context of the campaign. And those concerns have been well documented.\nBut the election is over, and what we are focused on is prioritizing the smooth and effective transition. It doesn't mean those differences have gone away, and it doesn't mean our passion for those arguments has diminished. But it does mean that at some point it's the responsibility of people who work in the White House to prioritize a smooth and effective transition to the next administration. And that institutional responsibility supersedes any strong concerns that I and others in the White House have about the kind of divisive rhetoric we've seen on the campaign trail and what sort of responsibility the President-elect has for commenting on it.\nQ: I'm just asking, transition aside, do you believe that the President-elect has a responsibility to denounce those kinds of neo-Nazi comments?\nMR. EARNEST: And what I'm saying is that the smooth and effective transition is our top priority right now, and so I can't put it aside to comment on this issue, even though the feelings of people in this building about that kind of issue are intense.\nKaren.\nQ: Josh, does the President and the White House have a reaction to the bus accident yesterday in Tennessee that killed several schoolchildren?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, our heart goes out to the families of those who lost children in that terrible accident. In some ways, this is every parent's worst nightmare. And I know that first responders and EMTs and police officers responded quickly to the scene and performed heroically to try to save lives and ease suffering from those who were injured, and to deal respectfully with the families who sustained this tragic loss just three days before Thanksgiving.\nSo it's obviously a terrible situation there. And the families of those children who were killed and injured are on our minds today.\nQ: The head of NHTSA said that there should be a federal mandate for seatbelts in the U.S. Is this the White House position?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware that we've taken a position on this issue. I certainly would expect that that is a question that experts at the Department of Transportation, including at NHTSA, should carefully consider. And obviously the experts who are able to evaluate those kinds of questions are the ones whose advice we should follow.\nMike. Nice to see you back.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. Nice to see you. I'm wondering, in a post-9/11 world, heading into this all-American holiday, how concerned the President and his team may be about potential terror threats.\nMR. EARNEST: Mike, as you know, the Department of Homeland Security earlier today issued an updated NTAS sort of chronicling the kinds of protections that people should take and the kind of vigilance that is still in place in our national security infrastructure. And the truth is, 365 days a year, whether there's a holiday coming up or not, the men and women of our national security apparatus and our homeland security apparatus are going to great lengths to keep the American people safe.\nSometimes that vigilance is heightened around the holidays because we know that in the past some extremists and terrorist organizations have sought to use those holidays as a platform to carry out an act of violence. So I'd refer you to the Department of Homeland Security for an update on their analysis of the current situation.\nAs usual, the President will get a briefing from his national security team before the holiday about current threats and about all the steps that are being taken to mitigate and counter those threats. That response, in some cases, is something that is evident to the public in a form of an additional deployment of police officers or other security personnel. In other cases, there are steps that are taken that are unseen to the public but yet are critical to adapting to the current threat environment. And the President's expectation is that all those necessary steps are being taken, but he'll be updated on that before the holiday.\nQ: As Democrats do their post-mortem after the election, people are looking at different names to perhaps lead the party going forward. Former Governor Ed Rendell threw out the name of Vice President Joe Biden. Any thoughts on the Vice President perhaps having a role after this role here?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, the Vice President is somebody who is revered by Democrats in all 50 states, in large part because of his remarkable service to this country. And so it's not at all surprising to me that as senior officials in our party look for leadership moving forward, that they consider somebody as accomplished and as effective as Vice President Biden.\nI haven't spoken to the Vice President about his interest in assuming this responsibility. I now that he already has some plans on the books for his post-administration life. I don't know if there would be an opportunity for him to do something like this, or if he's even interested in doing that. But it's not surprising to me that his name is among those mentioned.\nQ: I'm wondering how active do you expect he will be after he leaves office in terms of trying to move the party forward, and if there are any concerns about his personality and name being associated -- whether that keeps younger talent from emerging.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Mike, the President had an opportunity to talk about this a little bit at the news conference that he did in Peru over the weekend. And one of the President's priorities for his post-White House life, after he takes a little bit of a break and fulfills his promise to take his wife on vacation, will be to think about what the Democratic Party can do to more effectively cultivate young talent. What can we do to make sure that young people have the skills and the passion for these issues?\nAnd I think that, in the President's mind, that in large part that passion is already there. And I think that we've seen this passion manifested in a lot of different ways. The question is, what can we do to channel that energy in a way that yields positive outcomes for our country, or certainly yields outcomes that are consistent with those passions as they're expressed. So making sure that they have the skills, that they have the knowledge to engage in this public debate in a constructive way I think is certainly something the President expects to spend quite a bit of time on post-presidency.\nI think the President is mindful of the unique status that he has for this generation of Americans, which is -- the President is somebody who inspired a young generation of Americans to be engaged in the governing of this country. And the President wants to facilitate that inspiration, and that means that there is an important role for him to play.\nBut you make an important point, Mike, which is that there also is a responsibility for that next generation to step up and to assume more responsibility, and not just rely on being impressed or inspired by an extraordinary political talent like President Barack Obama, but at some point they're going to have assume the mantle on their own. And we need to spend some time as a party -- and the President is certainly going to spend some time himself as a party leader and a former President -- about the most effective way for us to engage and inspire young people across the country.\nAnd at some point, this actually does stop being about party politics. There are plenty of young Republicans who feel passionate about a range of issues, not all of which are in alignment with the agenda that President Obama has put forward -- but some of them are. There are plenty of young Republicans who are out there, who are strongly supportive of the idea that we need immigration reform. There are plenty of young Republicans out there who understand that putting forward an affirmative strategy like the Trans-Pacific Partnership actually is good for the U.S. economy, because it's going to create businesses for young entrepreneurs in the United States to do business in Southeast Asia.\nSo those are just a couple of examples where having more passionate voices of young people on the Republican side, even if they're not voting for Democratic candidates for political office, they're contributing to the national conversation in a way -- that makes our country a better place.\nSo the President approaches this as somebody who is a proud Democrat and as somebody who is interested in seeing the Democratic Party succeed. But he's most of all interested in the success of the country. So if there's an opportunity for him to engage and inspire and motivate even young people on the other side of the aisle, he would relish that opportunity too.\nJuliet.\nQ: Josh, the President has awarded more Medals of Freedom than any other President in history, and obviously just held a ceremony a couple months ago. Can you explain why he felt like he wanted to award 20 more -- or 21 more medals today?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it's simple, Juliet. The President was aware of some more deserving awardees. And I think anybody who has had an opportunity to look through the list of recipients today would acknowledge that these are extraordinary people -- people who have made extraordinary contributions not just to the United States, but to people of different nationalities all around the world.\nI take the example of Bill and Melinda Gates. They've dedicated their fortune to curing disease and improving the educational prospects of people not just in the United States, but people all around the world. And that makes them worthy of the highest civilian honor that any President has to give.\nChris.\nQ: Josh, Donald Trump, on \"60 Minutes,\" said he's fine with the Supreme Court ruling in favor of same-sex marriage; called it settled and done. Given that he has pledged to appoint justices to the Supreme Court in the mold of late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, do those words have any value?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess that's a question you'll have to ask him. And ultimately he'll have to decide what kind of person he wants to fill vacancies on the Supreme Court, should they arise, or should they persist into his presidency. But ultimately that will -- I'll let him speak to whatever criteria he intends to use to appoint people to that position.\nI can tell you that President Obama is quite proud of the service of the people he's appointed to the Supreme Court. That certainly is true of Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kagan. And the President believes that Chief Judge Garland would be an excellent justice on the Supreme Court. And there are some Republicans who think that too, even if they can't say so.\nBut ultimately that responsibility will now rest with the next President of the United States in terms of filling vacancies on the Supreme Court.\nQ: But do you think that his words and saying that the marriage equality issue is resolved would defer a -- help deter a new process leading to a subsequent ruling that would undo the marriage -- the Obergefell decision?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, again, how he reconciles his public statements and his personnel choices is something that you can either ask him about now, or presumably you can get an off-the-record meeting with him -- (laughter) -- and then you can probably ask him that question. But if not, you'll have to take the kind of wait-and-see approach that the President was advocating, which is there are a lot of questions about what kind of an agenda the next administration will pursue, what sort of priorities he'll set, particularly when making important decisions like this. But I think ultimately the world will have to wait and see.\nQ: One more question. In North Carolina, Governor Pat McCrory still has not conceded the gubernatorial race, even though he has a deficit of 9,000 votes. Any reaction to the situation there?\nMR. EARNEST: Not really. I mean, this is something that -- I'll let the vote-counters decide. I think the one thing that I can say is that the way that Secretary Clinton and Senator Kaine have handled their election loss should serve as an example for candidates on both sides of the aisle. They have handled their loss with grace and dignity. They have not backed down from the arguments that they made. That actually resulted in them getting more votes than their opponent in the election. But they knew the rules in advance. And they have set a very high standard that other candidates should strive to live up to.\nJordan.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I want to ask you about another aspect of President Obama's post-presidency that he talked about on Sunday with the possibility that he might speak out after he leaves office if he sees that American values are under attack. I'm wondering if there was anything that he saw or witnessed from President-elect Trump in the last week, any announcements, statements or appointments that triggered him to say that.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Jordan, I guess what I would say is that, if he had, he certainly had ample opportunity to do so over the course of the last week. The President over the course of the last week has done four different news conferences in four different countries. He's made himself available to all of you to take questions. And so I guess if that had popped into his mind, again, I don't think he would schedule an off-the-record meeting with television executives and wish to share that opinion. He just would have said it publicly.\nWhat I think I would say, though, in terms of evaluating the President's answer is I think it's notable that he has talked frequently in the past about how much he appreciates the way that his predecessor, President George W. Bush, handled a similar situation.\nAgain, in this situation, you had President Obama, who had been quite critical of the Bush administration and some of the decisions that President Bush had made while in office. And President Obama had assumed office promising to change the direction of the country. And it must have been difficult for President Bush and his team to maintain some respectful distance from the ongoing political debate. And I think that's an indication of the character and leadership abilities of President Bush, and it certainly won him a lot of respect and admiration from not just President Obama, but others who served in the White House.\nAnd President Obama is certainly interested in living up to that standard. And that will be easy to do in the first couple of months, again, because he intends to take his wife on vacation and not follow the news closely. But after that, I think the President will continue to look for ways that he can pursue the same approach that we've seen from President George W. Bush.\nQ: The second part of his comment, he seemed to indicate that he wouldn't be taking the same approach as George W. Bush if something so severe, something worse -- something was to happen that was so off the rails in his opinion that he just had to speak out? Or is that a misreading of that, of his statement?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what I would -- I think the best way to understand exactly what he said is to understand what his preference would be, and his preference would be to be able to pursue the same approach that President George W. Bush has pursued. And he believes the country is well served by a smooth transition of power and by an incoming President who is committed to some basic tenets and principles of American democracy, and an outgoing President who is not weighing in on every policy proposal that is put forward by the new President.\nThe new President deserves the opportunity to make a public case about what his priorities are, and to form his own impression without somebody as influential as the outgoing President trying to undermine him or criticize him at every turn. The country is not served well by that, the institution of the presidency is not well served by that, and that's the way that the President is thinking about this. And that's his hope about how this will play out.\nJean, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Will the Donald Trump team be following President Obama's North Korean policy?\nMR. EARNEST: You'd have to ask the President-elect's team about what policy he chooses to pursue with respect to North Korea. Obviously, the Obama administration will work closely with the national security team that President-elect Trump appoints to help them understand exactly what situation they're inheriting. They can understand exactly what strategies we have pursued that have allowed us to make some progress. They will certainly talk about all of the military steps that we have taken to enhance our ability to protect the American people and to protect our allies in Asia. They will certainly brief them on the success that we have had in organizing the international community to impose some additional pressure on the North Korean regime. They will brief them on the steps that we have taken through the Treasury Department to try to increase that pressure through financial penalties.\nBut we'll also update them with the latest intelligence assessment about where things stand. But ultimately when it comes to making decisions and the future of that policy, that'll be the responsibility of the President-elect beginning on January 20th.\nQ: So if needed so, President Obama will consult -- continuing to consult about the North Korean issues?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I can't speak to any additional conversations that may occur between the President and the President-elect, but I can tell you that as the President-elect's team gets up to speed on a range of national security issues, we certainly will spend quite a bit of time at a variety of agencies talking to them about the policy that we've pursued with regard to North Korea, what steps we have taken to marshal international opinion and action on Korea, what steps we have taken militarily to enhance the safety and security of the American people and our allies. And we'll certainly update them with the latest intelligence assessment about where things stand in North Korea.\nThanks, everybody. We will not do a briefing here tomorrow, so I wish you all a very happy Thanksgiving. I hope you'll spend some time giving thanks to our many blessings with your family, and we'll see you here next Monday. Thanks a lot.\nEND 1:45 P.M.

Thank you. Everybody, please have a seat. We've got some work to do here. [Laughter] This is not all fun and games. [Laughter]\nWelcome to the White House, everybody. Today we celebrate extraordinary Americans who have lifted our spirits, strengthened our Union, pushed us toward progress.\nI always love doing this event, but this is a particularly impressive class. [Laughter] We've got innovators and artists, public servants, rabble rousers, athletes, renowned character actors, like the guy from \"Space Jam.\" [Laughter] We pay tribute to those distinguished individuals with our Nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\nNow, let me tell you a little bit about each of them.\nFirst, we came close to missing out on a Bill and Melinda Gates's incredible partnership. Because apparently Bill's opening line was, \"Do you want to go out 2 weeks from this coming Saturday?\" [Laughter] I mean, he's good with computers, but—[laughter].\nFortunately, Melinda believes in second chances. And the world is better for it. For two decades, the Gates Foundation has worked to provide lifesaving medical care to millions, boosting clean water supplies, improving education for our children, rallying aggressive international action on climate change, cutting childhood mortality in half. The list could go on.\nThese two have donated more money to charitable causes than anyone ever. Many years ago, Melinda's mom told her an old saying: \"To know that even one life has breathed easier because you lived, that is success.\" And by this and just about any other measure, few in human history have been more successful than these two impatient optimists.\nFrank Gehry has never let popular acclaim reverse his impulse to defy convention. \"I was an outsider from the beginning,\" he says, \"so for better or worse, I thrived on it.\" The child of poor Jewish immigrants, Frank grew up in Los Angeles, and throughout his life, he embraced the spirit of a city defined by an open horizon. He's spent his life rethinking shapes and mediums, seemingly the force of gravity itself; the idea of what architecture could be, he decided to upend, constantly repurposing every material available, from titanium to paper towel tube. He's inspiring our next generation through his advocacy for arts education in our schools. And from the Guggenheim to Bilbao to Chicago's Millennium Park—our hometown—to his home in Santa Monica, which I understand caused some consternation among his neighbors—[laughter]—Frank's work teaches us that while buildings may be sturdy and fixed to the ground, like all great art, they can lift our spirits. They can soar and broaden our horizons.\nWhen an undergraduate from rural Appalachia first set foot on the National Mall many years ago, she was trying to figure out a way to show that \"war is not just a victory or a loss,\" but \"about individual lives.\" She considered how the landscape might shape that message, rather than the other way around. The project that Maya Lin designed for her college class earned her a B-plus—[laughter]—and a permanent place in American history. [Laughter] So all of you B-plus students out there—[laughter]. The Vietnam Veterans Memorial has changed the way we think about monuments, but also about how we think about sacrifice and patriotism and ourselves. Maya has given us more than just places for remembering; she has created places for us to make new memories. Her sculptures, chapels, homes are \"physical act[s] of poetry,\" each reminding us that the most important element in art or architecture is human emotion.\nThree minutes before Armstrong and Aldrin touched down on the Moon, Apollo 11's lunar lander alarms triggered: red and yellow lights across the board. Our astronauts didn't have much time. But thankfully, they had Margaret Hamilton. A young MIT scientist—and a working mom in the sixties—Margaret led the team that created the onboard flight software that allowed the Eagle to land safely. And keep in mind that, at this time, software engineering wasn't even a field yet. There were no textbooks to follow, so, as Margaret says, \"There was no choice but to be pioneers.\"\nLuckily for us, Margaret never stopped pioneering. And she symbolizes the generation of unsung women who helped spend—send humankind into space. Her software architecture echoes in countless technologies today. And her example speaks of the American spirit of discovery that exists in every little girl and little boy who know that somehow, to look beyond the heavens is to look deep within ourselves and to figure out just what is possible.\nIf Wright is flight and Edison is light, then Hopper is code. [Laughter] Born in 1906, Rear Admiral Grace Murray Hopper followed her mother into mathematics, earned her Ph.D. from Yale, and set out on a long and storied career. At age 37, and a full 15 pounds below military guidelines—[laughter]—the gutsy and colorful Grace joined the Navy and was sent to work on one of the first computers, Harvard's Mark I.\nShe saw beyond the boundaries of the possible and invented the first compiler, which allowed programs to be written in regular language and then translated for computers to understand. While the women who pioneered software were often overlooked, the most prestigious award for young computer scientists now bear her name. From cell phones to cyber command, we can thank Grace Hopper for opening programming to millions more people, helping to usher in the information age, and profoundly shaping our digital world.\nSpeaking of really smart people—[laughter]—in the summer of 1950, a young University of Chicago physicist found himself at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Dick Garwin was there, he said, because Chicago paid its faculty for 9 months, but his family ate for 12. So, by the next summer, Dick had helped create the hydrogen bomb. And for the rest of his life, he dedicated himself to reducing the threat of nuclear war. Dick's not only an architect of the atomic age. Ever since he was a Cleveland kid tinkering with his father's movie projectors, he's never met a problem he didn't want to solve. Reconnaissance satellites, the MRI, GPS technology, the touchscreen all bear his fingerprints. He even patented a \"mussel washer\" for shellfish which—that I haven't used. [Laughter] The other stuff I have. [Laughter] Where is he? Okay.\nDick has advised nearly every President since Eisenhower, often rather bluntly. Enrico Fermi, also a pretty smart guy, is said to have called Dick \"the only true genius\" he ever met. I do want to see this mussel washer. [Laughter]\nAlong with these scientists, artists, and thinkers, we also honor those who have shaped our culture from the stage and the screen.\nIn her long and extraordinary career, Cicely Tyson has not only exceeded as an actor, she has shaped the course history. Cicely was never the likeliest of Hollywood stars. The daughter of immigrants from the West Indies, she was raised by a hard-working and religious mother who cleaned houses and forbade her children to attend the movies. But once she got her education and broke into the business, Cicely made a conscious decision not just to say lines, but to speak out. \"I would not accept roles,\" she said, \"unless they projected us, particularly women, in a realistic light, [and] dealt with us as human beings.\" And from \"Sounder,\" to \"The Trip to Bountiful,\" to \"The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman,\" Cicely's convictions and grace have helped for us to see the dignity of every single beautiful member of the American family. And she's just gorgeous. And—[applause]. Yes, she is.\nIn 1973, a critic wrote of Robert De Niro, \"This kid doesn't just act, he takes off into the vapors.\" [Laughter] And it was true, his characters are iconic: a Sicilian father turned New York mobster, a mobster who runs a casino, a mobster who needs therapy—[laughter]—a father-in-law who is scarier than a mobster—[laughter]—Al Capone, a mobster. [Laughter]\nRobert combines dramatic precision and, it turns out, comedic timing with his signature eye for detail. And while the name De Niro is synonymous with \"tough guy,\" his true gift is the sensitivity that he brings to each role. This son of New York artists didn't stop at becoming one of the world's great actors. He's also a director, a philanthropist, cofounder of the Tribeca Film Festival. Of his tireless preparation, from learning the saxophone to remaking his body, he once said, \"I feel I have to earn the right to play a part.\" And the result is honest and authentic art that reveals who we really are.\nIn 1976, Lorne Michaels implored the Beatles to reunite on his brand new show. [Laughter] In exchange, he offered them $3,000. [Laughter] And then he told them they could share it equally, or they could give Ringo a smaller cut. [Laughter] Which was early proof that Lorne Michaels has a good sense of humor.\nOn \"Saturday Night Live,\" he's created a world where a band of no names become comedy's biggest stars; where our friends the Coneheads and cheerleaders and land sharks and basement deadbeats and motivational speakers and an unfrozen caveman lawyer show up and Tom Hanks is on \"Black Jeopardy.\" [Laughter] After four decades, even in this fractured media culture that we've got, SNL remains appointment viewing; a mainline into not just our counterculture, but our culture; still a challenge to the powerful, especially folks like me.\nAnd yet, even after all these years, Lorne jokes that his tombstone should bear just a single word that's often found in the show's reviews: \"uneven.\" [Laughter] As a current U.S. Senator would say: \"Doggone it, Lorne, that's why people like you.\" Hey, he's produced—he produced a Senator too. It's pretty impressive.\nEllen DeGeneres has a way of making you laugh about something rather than at someone, except when I danced on her show; she laughed at me. [Laughter] But that's okay.\nIt's easy to forget now, when we've come so far, where now marriage is equal under the law, just how much courage was required for Ellen to come out on the most public of stages almost 20 years ago. Just how important it was not just to the LGBT community, but for all of us, to see somebody so full of kindness and light, somebody we liked so much, somebody who could be our neighbor or our colleague or our sister challenge our own assumptions, remind us that we have more in common than we realize, push our country in the direction of justice.\nWhat an incredible burden that was to bear: to risk your career like that—people don't do that very often—and then to have the hopes of millions on your shoulders. But it's like Ellen says: \"We all want a tortilla chip that can support the weight of guacamole.\" [Laughter] Which really makes no sense to me, but I thought would break the mood, because I was getting kind of choked up. [Laughter] And she did pay a price. We don't remember this. I hadn't remembered it. She did, for a pretty long stretch of time, even in Hollywood.\nAnd yet, today—every day, in every way—Ellen counters what too often divides us with the countless things that bind us together, inspires us to be better, one joke, one dance at a time.\nWhen \"The Candidate\" wins his race in the iconic 1972 film of the same name—which continues, by the way, for those of you who haven't seen it, and many of you are too young, to be perhaps the best movie about what politics is actually like, ever—he famously asks his campaign manager the reflective and revealing question: \"What do we do now?\" And like the man he played in that movie, Robert Redford has figured it out and applied his talent and charm to achieve success.\nWe admire Bob not just for his remarkable acting, but for having figured out what to do next. He created a platform for independent filmmakers with the Sundance Institute. He has supported our national parks and our natural resources as one of the foremost conservationists of our generation. He's given his unmatched charisma to unforgettable characters like Roy Hobbs, Nathan Muir, and of course, the Sundance Kid, entertaining us for more than half a century. As an actor, director, producer, and as an advocate, he has not stopped—and apparently drives so fast that he had breakfast in Napa and dinner in Salt Lake. [Laughter] At 80 years young, Robert Redford has no plans to slow down.\nAccording to a recent headline, the movie \"Sully\" was the last straw. We should never travel with Tom Hanks. [Laughter] I mean, you think about, you got pirates, plane crashes, you get marooned in airport purgatory, volcanoes—something happens with Tom Hanks. [Laughter] And yet somehow, we can't resist going where he wants to take us. He's been an accidental witness to history, a crusty woman's baseball manager, an everyman who fell in love with Meg Ryan three times. [Laughter] Made it seem natural to have a volleyball as your best friend. From a Philadelphia courtroom, to Normandy's beachheads, to the dark side of the moon, he has introduced us to America's unassuming heroes.\nTom says he just saw \"ordinary guys who did the right thing at the right time.\" Well, it takes one to know one, and \"America's Dad\" has stood up to cancer with his beloved wife Rita. He has championed our veterans, supported space exploration, and the truth is, Tom has always saved his best roles for real life. He is a good man, which is the best title you can have.\nSo we've got innovators, entertainers. Three more folks who've dedicated themselves to public service.\nIn the early 1960s, thousands of Cuban children fled to America, seeking an education they'd never get back home. And one refugee was 15-year-old named Eduardo Padron, whose life changed when he enrolled at Miami Dade College. That decision led to a bachelor's degree, then a master's degree, then a Ph.D. And then, he had a choice: He could go into corporate America, or he could give back to his alma mater. And Eduardo made his choice: to create more stories just like his.\nAs Miami Dade's President since 1995, Dr. Padron has built a \"dream factory\" for one of our Nation's most diverse student bodies: 165,000 students in all. He is one of the world's preeminent education leaders: thinking out of the box, supporting students throughout their lives, embodying the belief that we're only as great as the doors we open. Eduardo's example is one we can all follow: a champion of those who strive for the same American Dream that first drew him to our shores. When Elouise Cobell first filed a lawsuit to recover lands and money for her people, she didn't set out to be a hero. She said, \"I just wanted . . . to give people—I just wanted to give justice to people that didn't have it.\" And her lifelong quest to address the mismanagement of American Indian lands, resources, trust funds wasn't about special treatment, but the equal treatment at the heart of the American promise. She fought for almost 15 years, across three Presidents, seven trials, 10 appearances before a Federal appeals court. All the while, she traveled the country some 40 weeks a year, telling the story of her people. And in the end, this graduate of a one-room schoolhouse became a MacArthur \"genius.\" She is a proud daughter of Montana's Blackfeet Nation. Reached ultimately a historic victory for all Native Americans. Through sheer force of will and a belief that the truth will win out, Elouise Cobell overcame the longest odds, reminding us that fighting for what is right is always worth it.\nNow, every journalist in the room, every media critic knows the phrase Newt Minow coined: the \"vast wasteland.\" But the two words Newt prefers we remember from his speech to the nation's broadcasters are these: \"public interest.\" That's been the heartbeat of his life's work: advocating for residents of public housing, advising a Governor and Supreme Court Justice, cementing Presidential debates as our national institution, leading the FCC.\nWhen Newt helped launch the first communications satellites, making nationwide broadcasts possible and eventually GPS possible and cell phones possible, he predicted it would be more important than the moon landing. \"This will launch ideas into space,\" he said, \"and ideas last longer than people.\" As far as I know, he's the only one of today's honorees who was present on my first date with Michelle. [Laughter] Imagine our surprise when we saw Newt, one of our bosses that summer, at the movie theater: \"Do the Right Thing.\" So he's also been vital to my personal interests. [Laughter]\nAnd finally, we honor five of the alltime greats in sports and music.\nThe game of baseball has a handful of signature sounds. You hear the crack of the bat. You've got the crowd singing in the seventh inning stretch. And you've got the voice of Vin Scully. Most fans listen to a game's broadcast when they can't be at the ballpark. Generations of Dodgers fans brought their radios into the stands, because you didn't want to miss one of Vin's stories.\nMost play-by-play announcers partner with an analyst in the booth to chat about the action. Vin worked alone and talked just with us. Since Jackie Robinson started at second base, Vin taught us the game and introduced it—us to its players. He narrated the improbable years, the impossible heroics, turned contests into conversations. When he heard about this honor, Vin asked with characteristic humility, \"Are you sure?\" [Laughter] \"I'm just an old baseball announcer.\" And we had to inform him that to Americans of all ages, you are an old friend. In fact, I thought about him doing all these citations—[laughter]—which would have been very cool. [Laughter] But I thought we shouldn't make him sing for his supper like that. [Laughter] \"Up next\"—[laughter].\nHere's how great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was: 1967, he had spent a year dominating college basketball, the NCAA bans the dunk. They'd didn't say it was about Kareem, but it was about Kareem. [Laughter] When a sport changes its rules to make it harder just for you, you are really good. [Laughter] And yet despite the rule change, he was still the sport's most unstoppable force. It's a title he'd hold for more than two decades, winning NBA Finals MVPs a staggering 14 years apart.\n[At this point, an audience member sneezed.] The President. Bless you. [Laughter]\nAnd as a surprisingly similar-looking copilot, Roger Murdoch, once said in the movie \"Airplane\"—I mean, we've got some great actors here—\"Space Jam,\" \"Airplane.\" [Laughter] He did it all while dragging Walton and Lanier up and down the court for 48 minutes. But the reason we honor Kareem is more than just a pair of goggles and the \"skyhook.\" He stood up for his Muslim faith when it wasn't easy and it wasn't popular. He's as comfortable sparring with Bruce Lee as he is advocating on Capitol Hill or writing with extraordinary eloquence about patriotism. Physically, intellectually, spiritually, Kareem is one of a kind, an American who illuminates both our most basic freedoms and our highest aspirations.\nWhen he was 5 years old, Michael Jordan nearly cut off his big toe with an axe. [Laughter] Back then, his handles needed a little work. But think: If things had gone differently, Air Jordans might never have taken flight. [Laughter] I mean, you don't want to buy a shoe with, like, one toe missing. [Laughter] We may never have seen him switch hands in mid-air against the Lakers or drop 63 in the Garden or gut it out in the \"flu game\" or hit \"the shot\" three different times: over Georgetown, over Ehlo, over Russell. We might not have seen him take on Larry Bird in H-O-R-S-E or lift up the sport globally along with the Dream Team.\nYet MJ is still more than those moments, more than just the best player on the two greatest teams of all time: the Dream Team and the 1996 Chicago Bulls. [Laughter] He's more than just a logo, more than just an Internet meme. [Laughter] He's more than just a charitable donor or a business owner committed to diversity. There is a reason you call somebody \"the Michael Jordan of\"—[laughter]. Michael Jordan of neurosurgery or the Michael Jordan of rabbis—[laughter]—or the Michael Jordan of outrigger canoeing—and they know what you're talking about. Because Michael Jordan is the Michael Jordan of greatness. He is the definition of somebody so good at what they do that everybody recognizes it. That's pretty rare.\nAs a child, Diana Ross loved singing and dancing for family friends, but not for free. [Laughter] She was smart enough to pass the hat. And later, in Detroit's Brewster housing projects, she met Mary Wilson and Florence Ballard. Their neighbor, Smokey Robinson, put them in front of Berry Gordy, and the rest was magic, music history. The Supremes earned a permanent place in the American soundtrack.\nAlong with her honey voice, her soulful sensibility, Diana exuded glamour and grace and filled stages that helped to shape the sound of Motown. On top of becoming one of the most successful recording artists of all time, raised five kids, somehow found time to earn an Oscar nomination for acting. Today, from the hip-hop that samples her, to the young singers who've been inspired by her, to the audiences that still cannot get enough of her, Diana Ross's influence is inescapable as ever.\nHe was sprung from a cage out on Highway 9. [Laughter] Quiet kid from Jersey, just trying to make sense of the temples of dreams and the mystery that dotted his hometown: pool halls, bars; girls and cars; altars and assembly lines. And for decades, Bruce Springsteen has brought us all along on a journey consumed with the bargains between ambition and injustice and pleasure and pain; the simple glories and scattered heartbreak of everyday life in America.\nTo create one of his biggest hits, he once said: \"I wanted to craft a record that sounded like the last record on Earth . . . the last one you'd ever need to hear. One glorious noise . . . then the apocalypse.\" [Laughter] Every restless kid in America was given a story: \"Born To Run.\" He didn't stop there. Once he told us about himself, he told us about everybody else: steelworker in \"Youngstown\"; the Vietnam Vet in \"Born To Run\"—\"Born in the U.S.A.\"; the sick and the marginalized on \"The Streets of Philadelphia\"; the firefighter carrying the weight of a reeling but resilient nation on \"The Rising\"; the young soldier reckoning with \"Devils and Dust\" in Iraq; the communities knocked down by recklessness and greed in the \"Wrecking Ball\"; all of us, with all our faults and our failings, every color and class and creed, bound together by one defiant, restless train rolling toward \"The Land of Hope and Dreams.\" These are all anthems of our America, the reality of who we are and the reverie of who we want to be.\n\"The hallmark of a rock and roll band,\" Bruce Springsteen once said, is that \"the narrative you tell together is bigger than anyone could have told on your own.\" And for decades, alongside the Big Man, Little Steven, a Jersey girl named Patti, and all the men and women of the E Street Band, Bruce Springsteen has been carrying the rest of us on his journey, asking us all \"what is the work for us to do in our short time here.\"\nI am the President; he is \"The Boss.\" [Laughter] And pushing 70, he's still laying down 4-hour live sets. If you have not been at them, he is working. \"Fire-breathing rock 'n' roll.\" So I thought twice about giving him a medal named for freedom because we hope he remains, in his words, a \"prisoner of rock 'n' roll\" for years to come.\nSo, I told you, this is, like, a really good class. [Laughter]\nLadies and gentlemen, I want you all to give it up for the recipients of the 2016 Presidential Medal of Freedom. [Applause] It is a good group.\nAll right. Now we've actually got to give them medals. [Laughter] So please be patient. We are going to have my military aide read the citations. Each one of them will come up and receive the medals, and then we'll wrap up the program.\nOkay? Let's hit it.\n[At this point, Lt. Col, Andrew C. Steadman, USA, Army Aide to the President, read the citations, and the President presented the medals, assisted by Lt. Col. Wesley N. Spurlock III, USAF, Air Force Aide to the President.]\nThe President. So, just on a personal note, part of the reason that these events are so special to me is because everybody on this stage has touched me in a very powerful, personal way, in ways that they probably couldn't imagine. Whether it was having been inspired by a song or a game or a story or a film or a monument or in the case of Newt Minow introducing me to Michelle—[laughter]—these are folks who have helped make me who I am and think about my Presidency, and what also makes them special is, this is America.\nAnd it's useful when you think about this incredible collection of people to realize that this is what makes us the greatest nation on Earth. Not because of what we—not because of our differences, but because, in our difference, we find something common to share. And what a glorious thing that is. What a great gift that is to America.\nSo I want all of you to enjoy the wonderful reception that will be taking place afterwards. Michelle and I have to get back to work, unfortunately, but I hear the food is pretty good. [Laughter] And I would like all of you to give one big rousing round of applause to our 2016 honorees for the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Give it up.", "timestamp": "2016-11-22", "title": "Remarks on Presenting the Presidential Medal of Freedom"}

Hey! Thank you so much, everybody. Please have a seat, have a seat.\nFor generations, Presidents have faithfully executed two great American traditions: issuing a proclamation that sets aside a Thursday in November for us to express gratitude, and granting pardons that reflect our beliefs in second chances. And this week, we do both. [Laughter]\nOf course, Thanksgiving is a family holiday as much as a national one. So, for the past 7 years, I've established another tradition: embarrassing my daughters with a \"corny-copia\" of dad jokes about turkeys. [Laughter] This year, they had a scheduling conflict. [Laughter] Actually, they just couldn't take my jokes anymore. [Laughter] They were \"fed\" up.\nAudience members. Ooh! Hey!\nThe President. Fortunately, I have by my side here today two of my nephews, Austin and Aaron Robinson, who, unlike Malia and Sasha, have not yet been turned cynical by Washington. [Laughter] They still believe in bad puns. They still appreciate the grandeur of this occasion. They still have hope. [Laughter]\nMalia and Sasha, by the way, are thankful that this is my final Presidential turkey pardon. What I haven't told them yet is that we are going to do this every year from now on. [Laughter] No cameras. Just us. Every year. No way I'm cutting this habit cold turkey. [Laughter]\nGood one, yes? That was pretty funny. Yes? [Laughter]\nThanksgiving is a chance—[laughter]—to gather with loved ones, reflect on our many blessings, and after a long campaign season, finally turn our attention from polls to poultry. [Laughter] This year, we're honored to be joined by two of the lucky ones, who were raised by the Domino family in Iowa: Tater and Tot.\nNow, Tater is here in a backup role, just in case Tot can't fulfill his duties. So he's sort of like the Vice Turkey. [Laughter] We're working on getting him a pair of aviator glasses. [Laughter]\nAnd it is my great privilege—well, it's my privilege; actually, let's just say it's my job—[laughter]—to grant them clemency this afternoon. As I do, I want to take a moment to recognize the brave turkeys who weren't so lucky, who didn't get to ride the gravy train to freedom—[laughter]—who met their faith—fate with courage and sacrifice and proved that they weren't chicken. [Laughter]\n[At this point, a baby cried.]\nThe President. Oh, it's not that bad now. Come on. [Laughter]\nOf course, we have a lot to be thankful for this Thanksgiving: 6 straight years of job creation, the longest streak ever; low unemployment. Wages are rising again. Inequality is narrowing. The housing market is healing. The stock market has nearly tripled. Our high school graduation rate is at an alltime high. And our uninsured rate is at an alltime low, thanks to the 20 million more Americans, including millions of children, who finally know the security of health insurance. Proud families—[applause]—that's worth gobbling about. [Laughter] Proud families across the country are finally complete now that marriage equality is the law of the land. And there are many families of servicemembers who had empty chairs at the table in recent years, but who on this Thanksgiving can celebrate with our brave troops and veterans who we've welcomed home.\nThanksgiving is also a reminder of the source of our national strength: that out of many, we are one; that we're bound not by any one race or religion, but rather by an adherence to a common creed, that all of us are created equal. And while accepting our differences and building a diverse society has never been easy, it has never been more important. We are a people that look out for one another and get each other's backs. We keep moving forward, defined by values and ideals that have been a light to all humanity.\nWe have to see ourselves in each other, because we've all got families we love, and we all have hopes for their better future. And we lose sight of that sometimes, and Thanksgiving is a good time for us to remember that. We have a lot more in common than divides us.\nThe holidays are also a time when it's even more important to reach out to those who need a helping hand. I believe we're judged by how we care for the poor and the vulnerable, the sick and the elderly, the immigrant, the refugee, everybody who's trying to get a second chance. I believe that in order to truly live up to those ideals, we have to continually fight discrimination in all its forms and always show the world that America is a generous and giving country.\nWe should also make sure everyone has something to eat on Thanksgiving—of course, except the turkeys, because they're already stuffed. [Laughter] So, later today the——\nAudience members. Ooh!\nThe President. [Laughter] So, later today the Obama family will participate in our traditional Thanksgiving service project. And when somebody at your table tells you that you've been hogging all the side dishes and you can't have any more, I hope that you respond with a creed that sums up the spirit of a hungry people: Yes, we cran. [Laughter] That was good. [Laughter] You don't think that's funny? Look, I know there are some bad ones in here, but this is the last time I'm doing this, so we're not leaving any room for leftovers. [Laughter]\nLet me just say—how am I doing? Good?\nAustin Robinson. Good.\nThe President. Thumbs up?\nLet me just say one last thing before I spare these turkeys' lives. On this Thanksgiving, I want to express my sincere gratitude to the American people for the trust that you've placed in me over these last 8 years and the incredible kindness that you've shown my family. On behalf of Michelle and my mother-in-law and our girls, we want to thank you so very, very much.\nAnd now, from the Rose Garden, Tater and Tot will go to their new home at Virginia Tech, which is admittedly a bit Hokie. [Laughter] They'll get to live out their natural lives at a new facility called Gobblers Rest, where students and veterinarians will care for them. And so let's get on with the pardoning, because it's Wednesday afternoon, and everyone knows that Thanksgiving traffic can put people in a \"fowl\" mood.\nAudience members. Ooh! [Laughter]\nThe President. Happy Thanksgiving, everybody. Let's go pardon these turkeys. Come on, guys! Come on! Come on!

Robinson.]", "timestamp": "2016-11-23", "title": "Remarks at the Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation Ceremony"}

Though the journey was rough and their first winter harsh, the friendly embrace of an indigenous people, the Wampanoag—who offered gracious lessons in agriculture and crop production—led to their successful first harvest. The Pilgrims were grateful they could rely on the generosity of the Wampanoag people, without whom they would not have survived their first year in the new land, and together they celebrated this bounty with a festival that lasted for days and prompted the tradition of an annual day of giving thanks.\nThis history teaches us that the American instinct has never been to seek isolation in opposite corners; it is to find strength in our common creed and forge unity from our great diversity. On that very first thanksgiving celebration, these same ideals brought together people of different backgrounds and beliefs, and every year since, with enduring confidence in the power of faith, love, gratitude, and optimism, this force of unity has sustained us as a people. It has guided us through times of great challenge and change and allowed us to see ourselves in those who come to our shores in search of a safer, better future for themselves and their families.\nOn this holiday, we count our blessings and renew our commitment to giving back. We give thanks for our troops and our veterans—and their families—who give of themselves to protect the values we cherish; for the first responders, teachers, and engaged Americans who serve their communities; and for the chance to live in a country founded on the belief that all of us are created equal. But on this day of gratitude, we are also reminded that securing these freedoms and opportunities for all our people is an unfinished task. We must reflect on all we have been afforded while continuing the work of ensuring no one is left out or left behind because of who they are or where they come from.\nFor generations, our Nation's progress has been carried forward by those who act on the obligations we have to one another. Each year on Thanksgiving, the selflessness and decency of the American people surface in food banks and shelters across our country, in time spent caring for the sick and the stranger, and in efforts to empathize with those with whom we disagree and to recognize that every individual is worthy of compassion and care. As we gather in the company of our friends, families, and communities—just as the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag did centuries ago—let us strive to lift up others, promote tolerance and inclusiveness, and give thanks for the joy and love that surround all of us.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 24, 2016, as a National Day of Thanksgiving. I encourage the people of the United States to join together—whether in our homes, places of worship, community centers, or any place of fellowship for friends and neighbors—and give thanks for all we have received in the past year, express appreciation to those whose lives enrich our own, and share our bounty with others.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-11-23", "title": "Proclamation 9546—Thanksgiving Day, 2016"}

On behalf of the Obama family—Michelle, Malia, Sasha, Grandma, Bo, and Sunny—I want to wish you a very happy Thanksgiving. Like so many of you, we'll spend the day with friends and family, turkey and touchdowns. We'll give thanks for each other and for all that God has given us. And we'll reflect on what truly binds us as Americans.\nThat's never been more important. As a country, we've just emerged from a noisy, passionate, and sometimes divisive campaign season. After all, elections are often where we emphasize what sets us apart. We face off in a contest of us versus them. We focus on the candidate we support instead of some of the ideals that we share.\nBut a few short weeks later, Thanksgiving reminds us that no matter our differences, we're still one people, part of something bigger than ourselves. We are communities that move forward together. We're neighbors who look out for one another, especially those among us with the least. We are always, simply, Americans.\nThat's why, through the fog of Civil War, President Lincoln saw what mattered most: the unalienable truths for which so many gave their lives and which made possible \"a new birth of freedom.\" And so, precisely when the fate of the Union hung in the balance, he boldly proclaimed a day of Thanksgiving, when the Nation's gifts \"should be solemnly, reverently, and gratefully acknowledged, as with one heart and one voice by the whole American people.\"\nToday we continue to give thanks for those blessings and to all who ensured that they would be our inheritance. We remember the determined patriots who landed at the edge of the world in search of freedom. We give thanks to the brave men and women who defend that freedom in every corner of the world. And we honor all people—from the First Americans to our newest arrivals—who continue to shape our Nation's story, enrich our heritage, and give meaning to our founding values, values we must never take for granted: that in America, we are bound not by any one race or religion, but rather an adherence to a common belief, that all of us are created equal; that we may think and worship and speak and love as we please; that the gift of democracy is ours—and ours alone—to nurture and to protect.\nNever doubt, that is what makes us American: not where we come from, what we look like, or what faith we practice, but the ideals to which we pledge our allegiance. It's about our capacity to live up to the creed as old as our founding: e pluribus unum—that out of many, we are one. And as long as we continue to welcome the contributions of all people, as long as we stand up for each other, speak out for what is right and stay true to these ideals—not just when it's easy, but when it's hard—then no one can ever take away our liberty. Our best days will always be ahead. And we will keep building a future where all of our children know the promise of America.\nHappy Thanksgiving, everybody.", "timestamp": "2016-11-24", "title": "The President's Weekly Address"}

Trump to lead them for a reason,\" said Ms. McFarland. \"He has the courage, brilliance and energy to Make America Great Again, and nobody has called foreign policy right more than President-elect Trump, and he gets no credit for it. I'm honored and humbled that he has asked me to be part of his team.\"\n\"In asking KT McFarland to become his Deputy National Security Advisor, President-elect Trump has brought to the top ranks of his Administration one of our country's most experienced, informed, and wise foreign policy and national security experts\" said Joe Lieberman, former U.S. Senator from Connecticut. \"KT and General Mike Flynn will form a very strong leadership team at the National Security Council. Beyond KT's professional skills, I can speak to her personal character strengths as well because I have known her as a family friend ever since she had the good judgement to marry Alan McFarland who was my classmate at college and law school. KT has great personal values. She is a woman of honor, compassion, and patriotism.\"\n\"As a friend and colleague, I've watched KT's depth of knowledge and understanding grow from her days as a college student on Dr. Kissinger's White House staff to her work at the Pentagon during the Reagan Administration, to become one of our country's most insightful national security analysts,\" said Hon. Robert C. \"Bud\" McFarlane, President Reagan's National Security Advisor.\nMs. McFarland is among the nation's foremost national security experts and is currently serving as FOX News' national security analyst.\nMs. McFarland held national security posts in the Nixon, Ford and Reagan Administrations: as an aide to Dr. Henry Kissinger, member of the Senate Armed Services Committee staff senior speechwriter to Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger and later Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs.\nIn 1985, Ms. McFarland received the Defense Department's highest civilian honor, the Distinguished Service Award, for her work in the Reagan Administration. She ran for New York's U.S. Senate seat in 2006. The Clare Booth Luce Policy Institute named her Woman of the Year at the CPAC conference in 2015.\nMs. McFarland received a B.A. from George Washington University, a M.A. from Oxford University, and completed the Massachusetts Institute of Technology PhD program (all but dissertation) with concentrations on nuclear weapons, China, and the Soviet Union. Ms. McFarland is a senior policy fellow for the ACU Foundation Statesmanship and Diplomacy Center, a board member of the Jamestown Foundation, and a distinguished advisor to the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\nIn addition to adding Ms. McFarland to the national security team, President-elect Trump is also pleased to add Mr. McGahn as Assistant to the President and White House Counsel.\nMr. McGahn has a distinguished legal career that spans two decades. Mr. McGahn served as general counsel for President-elect Trump's campaign and currently on transition and will continue providing expert advice and counsel in the Trump-Pence Administration.\n\"Don has a brilliant legal mind, excellent character and a deep understanding of constitutional law,\" said President-elect Trump. \"He will play a critical role in our administration, and I am grateful that he is willing to serve our country at such a high-level capacity.\"\n\"I am honored to continue advising President-elect Trump in the Trump-Pence Administration,\" said Mr. McGahn. \"President-elect Trump is a bold leader committed to draining the swamp in Washington and restoring economic prosperity and security. I look forward to serving the American public in this role.\"\n\"Donald McGahn will make an excellent counsel to the president,\" said Ed Meese, Attorney General and Counselor to President Ronald Reagan. \"Throughout his distinguished career as a lawyer and government official, he has dealt ably with the intersection between politics, government ethics, and the rule of law.\"\n\"The Counsel to the President needs solid Washington experience, but also a serious prior relationship with the President that allows for candor, and a practical understanding of how government agencies function. It also is enormously useful to have a working knowledge of government ethics and election law. Donald McGahn possesses all these attributes and can serve President-elect Trump well,\" said C. Boyden Gray, White House Counsel to President George H.W. Bush.\nMr. McGahn is currently a partner at Jones Day in Washington, DC, and has specialized in political law, including government ethics. He has successfully counseled and defended a wide range of clients including federal and state candidates, members of Congress, national and state political party committees, nonprofits and trade associations.\nMr. McGahn served as a member of the FEC five years, during which he served as both chairman and vice chairman. He was named to the 2014 \"Influencers 50\" list in Campaigns & Elections magazine (November 18, 2013), and cited as \"one of the most influential commissioners in the history of the FEC\" and one with strong relationships on both sides of the aisle.\nIn addition, he served as general counsel for the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) for nearly 10 years, where he counseled members of Congress regarding ethics.\nMr. McGahn earned a B.A. from the University of Notre Dame and a J.D. from Widener University.", "timestamp": "2016-11-25", "title": "Press Release - President-Elect Donald J.

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119736", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n1:08 P.M. EST\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Nice to see you all. Hope you had a pleasant Thanksgiving holiday with your families.\nQ: And you.\nMR. EARNEST: Thank you. I do not have any comments at the top, so we can go straight to your questions.\nKevin Freking, do you want to start?\nQ: Thank you, Josh. I wanted to ask, how does the administration view Fidel Castro's passing on the impact on normalization of relations between the U.S. and Cuba? Does it delay, does it hasten normalization of relations with Cuba?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, at least from the U.S. standpoint, I wouldn't expect any impact on the kind of progress that we're committed to making on our end to begin to normalize relations with Cuba.\nAs you know, when President Obama made an announcement almost two years ago now to begin normalizing relations between our two countries, this was rooted in the President's conclusion that a policy of isolation that the United States had pursued for more than five decades had failed to bring about the improved human rights climate that I think just about every American citizen would like to see in Cuba. And after five decades of trying the same policy of isolation without seeing many results, the President believed it was time to try something different.\nAnd what we have seen is greater freedom for American citizens to visit Cuba, to send money to family members in Cuba, to engage in business and seek business opportunities in Cuba. It also enhanced the ability of the United States government to maintain an embassy in Cuba where U.S. officials can more effectively not just engage with government officials in Cuba but also those activists in civil society that are fighting for greater freedoms.\nThose are all good things. Those are all benefits that are enjoyed by Americans. They also facilitate the kind of people-to-people ties that we believe will be more effective in bringing freedom and opportunity to the Cuban people, something that they have long sought and been denied by the Cuban government. And after five decades of not seeing any results, the President believed it was time to see something different.\nAnd I think it is -- we clearly haven't seen all the results that we would like to see, but we're pleased with the progress. And it certainly has benefitted the American people in a tangible way and it continues to be strongly supported by an overwhelming majority of Cubans. When they're asked about their opinion of this change in our policy, it's something that was very warmly welcomed by the Cuban people. And I think that should be a pretty good indication of the kind of success that this policy is already having.\nQ: So, no on our end, but what about on their end? With his passing, do you anticipate that they would be more receptive to making some of the changes that the U.S. is calling for as far as opening up their private sector, things along those lines?\nMR. EARNEST: Time will tell. I'll let the Cuban government speak for the plans that they intend to pursue. Obviously we'd welcome a hastening of the kinds of changes that we would like to see, but I'll let my Cuban counterpart speak to any plans that they may have and whether or not they're changed by the death of Mr. Castro.\nQ: Just one more question along those lines. How does the President see -- how will history view Fidel Castro in the President's mind?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think that he obviously is a towering figure who had a profound impact on the history of not just his country but the Western Hemisphere. There certainly is no whitewashing the kinds of activities that he ordered and that his government presided over that go against the very values that this country -- that our country -- has long defended.\nI think the question for the President is, in terms of making policy, are we going to be rooted in that past, or are we going to look to the future? It doesn't mean that we should ignore the past, but it does mean that we can't let the past interfere with our ability to make progress. And I think some of the changes that we've seen on Cuba already are an indication that progress is possible.\nAnd that's been the focus of the President's policy direction over the last several years. And there certainly will be ample opportunity for historians to take stock of Fidel Castro's legacy and what it has meant for the people in his country.\nQ: One last one. Would you comment on President-elect Trump's claims of massive voter fraud taking place in the presidential election? Is there any truth whatsoever to what he's saying?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, I would defer to the President-elect's team for commentary on his tweets. I think what I can say is an objective fact is that there has been no evidence produced to substantiate a claim like that. But for a reaction or an explanation, I'd refer you to the President-elect's team.\nAyesha.\nQ: Thank you. A little more on Cuba. Can you tell us anything about what the thoughts are on an official delegation going to Castro's funeral? What the plans are on that, and if there's any plans you can announce?\nMR. EARNEST: If there is a U.S. delegation that's sent to attend the funeral we'll obviously announce that publicly in the same way that we have other official delegations. But I don't have any information about that at this point to share.\nQ: So going back -- you mentioned how you can't whitewash some of Castro's actions. Some lawmakers did criticize the President's statement for not directly mentioning Castro's human rights abuses. Can you kind of talk about -- in the statement about his death. Can you kind of talk about or respond to that? And also, why was that decision made to not maybe more directly address some of those concerns?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, those critics of the statement are also critics of the policy, and have been scrambling to try to justify their loyalty to an obviously failed policy of isolation that didn't bring about any results for the Cuban people or for the American people.\nI think the President's statement quite clearly speaks for itself and it makes clear the President's desire to look toward the future. That's the responsibility that he has as the President of the United States and as the leader of this country, is to look out for the interests of the American people moving forward. It was a campaign slogan of his reelection. And that's what he's been focused on.\nAnd to issue some sort of blistering statement and engage in the kind of mutual recriminations that are tied to the past -- that doesn't advance freedom or democracy on the island nation of Cuba. It doesn't expand economic opportunity or cultural opportunity for the American people. It doesn't advance further the success that we've had in removing the Cuba issue as an impediment in our relationship with countries throughout the Western Hemisphere.\nThe President made the observation when he was in Latin America last week about the strength and health of the relationship between the United States and countries throughout the Western Hemisphere, and Latin America in particular -- they're as strong as they've ever been.\nSome of that is because of the commitment that this administration has made to reach out to engage countries in the Western Hemisphere to advance those relationships. But some of it is also attributable to the fact that for decades, the U.S. policy of isolating Cuba wasn't just an irritant in the relationship between the United States and Cuba, it actually was an irritant in the relationship between the United States and other countries in the Western Hemisphere that had a relationship with Cuba.\nAnd the consequence of that was that there wasn't as much of a discussion about the human rights conditions in Cuba; there was an extensive discussion, though, about the wisdom of the U.S. policy of isolation toward Cuba. Now that that has been removed, there's been much more scrutiny of the way the Cuban government treats the Cuban people. And it has allowed the United States to marshal international opinion and shine a brighter light on those policies in a way that has increased pressure on the Cuban government. And I think this was on full, vivid display during the President's trip to Cuba earlier this spring, where the Cuban leader faced direct, probing questions about the treatment of citizens in Cuba.\nSo I think this is all part of a strategy that is strongly supported by the Cuban people, has already yielded important benefits for the Cuban people. It's also yielded important benefits for the American people.\nAnd I know that many of the President's critics like to suggest that somehow the United States has made a bunch of concessions to the Cuban government. That's wrong. It's not a concession to allow Cuban Americans to send more money to their family members who are living in Cuba. It's not a concession to secure the release of Alan Gross, a USAID contractor that was wrongly detained in Cuba. It's not a concession to open an embassy in Cuba. It's not a concession to start daily flights between the United States and Cuba that makes it easier for Americans to visit Cuba. It's not a concession to allow American cruise operators to stop in Cuba. It's not a concession to allow American hotel operators to sign licensing agreements with resorts in Cuba. It's not a concession to give American agricultural interests the opportunity to do more business in Cuba.\nAll of those are things that had important benefits for the American people and are strongly supported by the Cuban people. So, again, I think it is very difficult for critics of this policy to make any sort of coherent, evidence-based argument that somehow the United States has been disadvantaged by this policy.\nBased on all of the things that I've laid out, those all are benefits for the American people that we've all enjoyed. And continued pursuit of this policy moving forward only stands to enhance the benefits for the Cuban people and for the American people.\nQ: One more question on -- there was an attack on Ohio State this morning. I was just wondering, has the President been briefed on that? Do you have anything further about like the investigation of that attack?\nMR. EARNEST: The President was briefed this morning by Lisa Monaco who is his top Homeland Security Advisor. The President asked to be updated on the investigation. I know that local law enforcement officials have indicated that the situation in Columbus is no longer active, the site has been secured. FBI officials in Columbus are assisting local authorities as they conduct this investigation.\nBut we'll obviously defer to local law enforcement to disclose additional information about what exactly occurred there. There's still a lot of information to review and collect. But obviously this is a difficult situation, and our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Columbus and the community of Ohio State at this difficult time.\nQ: Thank you.\nMR. EARNEST: Justin.\nQ: I wanted to ask about David Petraeus. You've said -- talked previously about how he had been continuing to stay in touch with administration officials to offer occasional advice. And I'm wondering if that continues to be true, and if so, if that maybe lessens criticism that has been offered by some Democrats of his candidacy for Secretary of State in a potential Trump administration.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, let me say a couple things about that. I have in the past acknowledged that there were senior U.S. officials in the Obama administration that had consulted with General Petraeus, based on his decades of service to this country and his areas of expertise. I'm not aware that that relationship was formalized in any sort of way, so I can't really speak to the last time that he participated in a meeting with a senior U.S. official, or even the last time that he had a conversation with a senior U.S. official.\nObviously, maintaining any sort of informal outside advisory role is a lot different than being nominated to serve as Secretary of State of the United States. But I recognize that there's a lot of speculation right now about who the President-elect will choose to serve in senior positions in his administration. And I've spent the better part of the last two and a half years avoiding commentary on rumors about who may serve in the Obama administration, and I'm certainly not going to comment on speculation about who may serve in the Trump administration.\nQ: I guess just as a guiding principle, does the President or does the administration believe that somebody who's had severe classification issues for which they've been convicted should hold senior positions in the United States government?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think every President is going to have to decide for themselves what kind of person can best serve them and the country in senior roles in the administration. And President Obama obviously took that responsibility very seriously and assembled a team that he's quite proud of to serve him and the country. And the President has spoken at some length about how proud he is that there hasn't been a major personal scandal in his administration; that the kind of people that he has chosen to serve in high-profile, influential positions in his administration have done so with a focus on the country's best interest. And the President is quite proud of that.\nObviously, future Presidents will have to -- I think will understandably -- be measured against that high standard, but they'll eventually have to decide on their own who they believe can best serve the country and best serve them in the range of important positions.\nQ: Let me guess -- you're not going to say if the President has told Donald Trump about the merits of the former presidential nominee from Massachusetts as Secretary of State?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any -- I can't speak to what sort of advice the President may or may not have offered to the President-elect as he's weighing some of these personnel decisions.\nQ: And last one on the spending bill. The last time we did this, the issue of money for Flint got kind of punted to the lame duck session, with Republicans promising that they'd find funding for Flint within the water bill. That seems to have somewhat stalled out on Capitol Hill right now. Knowing that you and I could perhaps negotiate a bill more easily than Congress could --\nMR. EARNEST: Are you taking my lines now? (Laughter.) Is that the deal? Is that what we're going to do here at the end? (Laughter.)\nQ: I'm just wondering if --\nMR. EARNEST: Justin, I just have one more for you. (Laughter.)\nQ: Like Jeopardy -- (laughter) --\nQ: -- if funding for Flint is going to be sort of a red line for the President in the CR.\nMR. EARNEST: Obviously, the President feels quite passionately about the need for Congress to fulfill their rightful role in providing resources to the community of Flint that has been dealing with the contamination of their water supply. This is a significant problem, and this administration has mobilized significant resources to try to respond to the urgent need of the people there. But it's going to require congressional resources to address the longer-term infrastructure challenge that exists. And there is a role for Congress to play. There were promises made by Republicans, and the President expects them to keep that promise.\nAlexis.\nQ: Josh, let me follow on an answer that you gave to Justin. Kellyanne Conway said that President Obama and Donald Trump had a fruitful discussion on Saturday that lasted about 45 minutes. You were just telling him that you don't want to discuss the advice that the President is giving the President-elect, but I'm going to ask you about that.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay. You're certainly entitled to do that.\nQ: Can you describe the nature of the call? Did the President call the President-elect? Did he want to talk about Castro's death or Cuba policy? Did he want to talk about nominations and what his perspective might be on potential nominees? Did he want to talk about another international situation that he thought that the President should be briefed on personally? Can you add, embellish, rule out anything?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, I can certainly confirm for you that the President did have a telephone conversation with the President-elect on Saturday. They spoke for 45 minutes or so. When the President-elect was in the Oval Office with President Obama 36 hours after the election results were tabulated, the President-elect indicated a desire to seek President Obama's advice and counsel repeatedly, and President Obama made clear that he stood ready to offer that advice because of his underlying, enduring commitment to a smooth and effective transition from the Obama presidency into the next.\nI didn't foresee a scenario in which we would announce when each call had taken place. What I'm certainly going to do is protect the ability of the President-elect to confidentially seek the advice of the sitting President. So I'm not going to be able to get into the content of the call, but I can certainly confirm for you that the call did take place, even if I'm not willing to promise that I will announce when future calls have been placed.\nQ: Who called whom?\nMR. EARNEST: My understanding is the President-elect reached out to President Obama, and President Obama returned his call.\nQ: And can you say whether this was the first time since they met in the Oval that they've conversed by phone?\nMR. EARNEST: I can confirm for you that it's not. But I won't be in a position to detail all of the conversations that they've had.\nQ: But can you give us an idea of how often this has happened?\nMR. EARNEST: There are a handful of times.\nQ: A handful? Five times?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think handful -- a handful is intentionally vague. (Laughter.)\nQ: Five or fewer?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I think I said all I'm going to say.\nQ: It's more than two -- but more than several? I mean, let's have a discussion --\nMR. EARNEST: Maybe you guys can figure that out.\nQ: Depends on how big the hands are. (Laughter.)\nQ: But can you add --\nMR. EARNEST: I can't. I'll spare you. Do you have anything else, Alexis?\nQ: There is no way to add to what we were talking about with Cuba, whether Cuba was discussed between them?\nMR. EARNEST: I just am not going to get into the content of their conversation.\nChip.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. No content, but how about tone? Were you in the room?\nMR. EARNEST: I was not.\nQ: You were not.\nMR. EARNEST: I was not.\nQ: Do you know anything about what the tone was? I mean, are they like best pals when they're on the phone together? Or is it tense? Can you say anything about the tone and the mood of these conversations aside from the content?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think that you -- again, I'm going to protect the ability of the President-elect to consult confidentially with the President of the United States. But I think to the extent that I am willing to characterize it, I think that's how I would do so, as a consultation. And the President-elect indicated publicly that he intended to seek out the advice and counsel of the sitting President of the United States, and that's something that he's done a couple of times now.\nQ: And Mr. Trump threatened to terminate the deal with Cuba today if Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban-American people, and the U.S. as a whole. You've talked about it before, but, now, how worried is the President that he will terminate this deal?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I'll let the President-elect and his team speak to whatever plans they may have in store once he takes office on January 20th. Certainly, I've spent a decent amount of time in this briefing already making a strong case about the way that the American people and the Cuban people have benefitted from the decision that President Obama made with the Cuban government to begin normalizing relations between our two countries.\nSo that normalization policy has brought about significant changes, including agreements to allow U.S. cruise ships to dock in Cuba. It won't be easy to rescind that permission. There are already licensing agreements that have been signed by at least one U.S. hotel company to begin operating facilities in Cuba. That would be a difficult thing to unwind.\nQ: Right. But is Mr. Obama fretting over the possibility that it could all be reversed?\nMR. EARNEST: No -- again, in part, because there are up to 110 daily flights that are scheduled to occur between -- scheduled to take off from the United States and land in Cuba on a daily basis in the coming months. In fact, today, coincidentally enough, the very first flight in several decades took off from the United States, commercial flight --\nQ: And can all be stopped.\nMR. EARNEST: -- and landed in Havana. And I don't know how many people had purchased tickets for this flight, but this is now -- there will now be daily flights between the United States and Havana.\nQ: Or not.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, unwinding that, Chip, is not as easy as just a stroke of a pen because there are significant consequences for doing that. There will be an economic impact in the United States and in Cuba for unraveling that policy.\nAgain, those who are the harshest critics, particularly those in Congress who are the harshest critics of the President's policy say that part of their concern is for the plight of the Cuban people. Well, first of all, the Cuban people overwhelmingly support this policy. According to some polls that I've seen, more than 90 percent of the Cuban people support this policy.\nThe second is that when Americans travel to Cuba, in some cases they're staying in properties that are advertised on Airbnb. Some 50,000 Americans in just the last 18 or 19 months have availed themselves of this opportunity. They're spending about $250, on average, per stay, and that's money that benefits the Cuban people, to say nothing of the cab drivers and the restauranteurs who benefit from this increased travel, as well.\nSo, again, to cancel all of that would deal a significant economic blow to those Cuban citizens. So I think it's very hard for critics of this policy to reconcile their opposition to this policy and their claimed desire to advance the interests of the Cuban people, because the truth is this policy does advance the interests of the Cuban people. So to take it away does not achieve the goal that they claim to have in mind.\nRon.\nQ: What about dissidents and the opposition to Cuba? Have they benefitted at all from this policy change?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, they certainly -- I can tell you one way that they benefitted. Some of them got a meeting with the President of the United States when he traveled to Cuba in March.\nQ: And has the Cuban government done anything positive, tangible in the name of human rights that you can tell us about?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, if the critics of this policy want to say that their desire is to lift up the cause of the Cuban people, I don't know what better way you could do that than to invite them to the United States embassy and have an in-person meeting with the President of the United States to talk about their efforts to fight for freedom and liberty in the island nation of Cuba. That certainly is a pretty profound statement and lifts up in an important way the cause of justice that they seek.\nSo, listen, I'll refer you to the Cuban government to discuss what kinds of steps they've taken to better protect and acknowledge the human rights of those who may have political disagreements with the government. What I can tell you is that the policy that we have pursued in terms of policymaking and in terms of the President's travel has succeeded in giving more attention and shining a spotlight on the cause of those Cubans who are putting themselves at grave risk to fight for the freedom and liberty of the Cuban people.\nQ: So just as the bottom line, is the President satisfied with what the Cuban government has done on human rights and is doing now on human rights, or not?\nMR. EARNEST: Ron, there is no doubt that we would like to see the Cuban government do more, but this policy has not even been in place for two years. But we certainly have enjoyed more benefits than was enjoyed under the previous policy that was in place for more than 50 years and didn't bring about the kinds of benefits or the kinds of progress that we would like to see.\nSo, again, I think it is hard for critics of this policy to somehow make the case that they're looking out for the interests of the Cuban people, because the interests of the Cuban people were not advanced by a policy of isolation that for more than 50 years affected the U.S. relationship with Cuba, but also affected our relationship with countries throughout the Western Hemisphere, and not for the better.\nQ: Is there evidence that the Cuban people, and not the Cuban government, have benefitted economically from this? You talk about cab drivers and so on and so forth, but is there really hard evidence that somehow the behavior of the government is changing, not just in terms of its treatment of dissidents, but in terms of how the economy functions? The critics of this policy say that there's no evidence. Critics say that, in fact, the government is the one who's benefitting, not the Cuban people, generally.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we can certainly provide you some additional evidence about the economic benefits that are enjoyed by the Cuban people. What I can tell you is that those Cuban citizens that do work in industries, like cab drivers or working in restaurants, even Airbnb owners, are benefitting from the enhanced economic activity between Cuban citizens and American citizens who are visiting Cuba. They are paid at a higher rate, and they're enjoying more economic activity than they otherwise would because of this policy to normalize relations with Cuba.\nSo we can follow up with you on some more specific data here. But what is clear is that there is a growing entrepreneurial sector inside of Cuba that is benefitting from greater engagement with the United States. That's a good thing, and that is a benefit that is enjoyed by the Cuban people directly.\nQ: On the conversations between the President and President-elect, is there -- I know you can't talk about specifics, but -- maybe you will change your mind -- but does the President -- what benefit does the President see coming from these handful of conversations? Is there something specific? I know the idea is to have a smooth transition, but is there anything specific that has been produced by these conversations that the President can say is a positive development, something that he has gotten out of this from the President-elect?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm just not going to be able to go into the details of their conversation to try to illustrate that kind of consequence or benefit. I think what I can say in general is that President Obama has been doing this job for almost eight years now and he's learned a lot about the kinds of challenges that every President faces. These are the kinds of challenges that are difficult to assess until you're actually sitting in that chair in the Oval Office. This is something the President talked about a lot on the campaign trail. This is a particularly significant challenge for someone who has never held elective office before.\nQ: So what were some of these specific challenges that he's perhaps been able to illuminate?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, I'm just not going to get into the details of their -- or the content of their conversation.\nQ: What about the recounts in Michigan and Wisconsin? What's the President's thinking about that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the President has talked a lot in the almost three weeks before the election -- or since the election -- about his institutional responsibilities as President. And those institutional responsibilities require him to focus on a smooth and effective transition to the next presidency, regardless of the partisan affiliation of the next President and regardless of whether or not the President endorsed the incoming President. Clearly he did not. But the President is determined to put his institutional responsibilities as the President of the United States ahead of his own personal feelings and ahead of his own political preferences.\nThe point of all this is that state election officials also have an institutional responsibility, and they have a responsibility to follow the election law in their state. And the election law in each state varies as it relates to when a recount can occur, how a recount should be conducted, what time frame in which a recount should be conducted, who bears the financial responsibility of paying for a recount. And the President's expectation is that state and local election administrators all across the country will fulfill their basic institutional responsibilities. And so far, at least in Wisconsin, we're seeing that election officials are doing that.\nQ: Is the White House and the Justice Department in any way involved in these recounts?\nMR. EARNEST: The White House certainly isn't. I'm not aware of any Justice Department involvement, but you should check with them to confirm that.\nQ: And I think you were asked earlier about the allegations by the President-elect about voter fraud. Is the Justice Department looking into that at all?\nMR. EARNEST: You'd have to check with them about that. But as I said before, it's just an objective fact that there's been no evidence marshalled to substantiate that kind of claim.\nQ: Just finally on the recount thing. I hear you saying that the law needs to be followed. So the President doesn't have a view as to whether this is a positive development or a negative development that the Green Party and the Clinton campaign in some way would be involved in pursuing this?\nMR. EARNEST: The President's expectation is that everybody would fulfill their institutional responsibilities. And certainly election administrators at the state and local level in states like Wisconsin and Michigan have a very clear set of rules and responsibilities that they should follow. And the President's expectation is that's what they should do.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I want to ask you about something Senator Rubio said about the passing of Fidel Castro. He said he was a ruthless dictator who executed thousands of opponents and imprisoned tens of thousands. Does the President, and more broadly, does the White House believe that Fidel Castro was, indeed, a murderer?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, there certainly is no denying the kind of violence that occurred in Cuba under the watch of the Castro regime. There has been no effort to whitewash the history, either the history between the United States and Cuba or the history of what transpired in Cuba while Mr. Castro was leading the country. What we have --\nQ: Then what's the problem in saying that?\nMR. EARNEST: I think I just did.\nQ: No, I'm sorry, I meant in the statement in particular, it seemed that the President -- he wasn't denying necessarily -- I thought he was very careful. And I think there are a number of people, in particular in south Florida, who felt like he could have been much more direct and stronger in saying that this is a person who killed his citizens, who led the destruction of their economy, and they would argue, took the lives and the livelihoods of tens of thousands of his countrymen. And yet the statement the President issued didn't really broach that subject. And I'm just curious why.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think there's a couple of things, Kevin. The first is there certainly has been no attempt on the part of this administration, either during President Obama's trip to Cuba earlier this spring or in the aftermath of Fidel Castro's death, to obscure or whitewash the history of the Cuban people under the Castro regime when Fidel Castro was leading that country.\nI think what we have sought to avoid -- what I know we have sought to avoid -- is the downward spiral of mutual recriminations between the United States and Cuba. What President Obama is focused on is not whitewashing the past, but actually acknowledging the past but also looking to the future and focusing on what we can do to advance the shared interests of our two countries and the people who live in our two countries.\nAnd the President believes that the most effective way for us to do that is to actually begin to move past that painful history and actually focus on what kinds of opportunities we can pursue now that will advance the plight of the Cuban people right now. And that's why normalizing relations between our two countries, enhancing people-to-people ties, enhancing economic ties between the United States and Cuba can ensure that there is more opportunity for the American people, but also so that there's more opportunity and more liberty and more freedom for the Cuban people, both economically, but also, hopefully in the future, politically.\nQ: Wouldn't it have made a really powerful statement to just absolutely say this is what evil looks like, and while we don't condone the past or while we're not acknowledging this person for anything beyond what he is or was, we do have a hopeful view of the future? It just looked like -- we talked a bit about the future; we were very benign in talking about this murderer's past from a person that seemed to be celebrated in a number of circles -- not saying the White House did -- but I'm just curious why the President felt so strongly to not really drill down on the fact that this person killed so many and I think should be seen as that person.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, we got a lot of the same kinds of questions in the context of the President's visit to Cuba.\nQ: Right.\nMR. EARNEST: And, again, I think the answer is just the same, which is that there's no denying what happened in the past; there's just a desire to try to advance the interest of the Cuban people and the American people by focusing on the future. And the President has put in place the kind of policy that over the course of two years has deepened and strengthened people-to-people and economic ties between our two countries in a way that we think will have positive, long-term benefits for the Cuban people.\nThat's why upwards of 90 percent of the Cuban people actually support this policy and they welcome the greater engagement with the United States. They welcome the increased remittances that are provided Cuban-Americans to family members in Cuba. They welcome the increase in travel by American citizens to Cuba. There's a lot to offer. And the Cuban people certainly benefit from that kind of greater engagement. And that's why the President has pursued this policy. And again, this policy hasn't even been in place for two years, but the President certainly believes it's showing a lot more promise than the failed policy that was in place for nearly six decades.\nQ: Let me ask you about Pearl Harbor Day coming up December 7th, the 75th anniversary of that fateful day. Is there any reason why the President wouldn't consider it important that he be there, be in Hawaii, to mark the occasion, in particular given his trip in previous months to Japan that, of course, many of us in this room accompanied him?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I am confident that President Obama will mark that fateful anniversary. And obviously there's a generation of Americans whose lives were transformed by that day that will live in infamy. In fact, the history of our country and the history of the world was changed by that day.\nOn that day, thousands of American lives were lost. These were some of the bravest Americans that our country had to offer who had volunteered to serve our country in the United States Navy. And so I'm confident the President will mark that day. And it obviously is consistent with the way that he has marked previous anniversaries.\nThe President had the opportunity two years ago to visit Normandy, the site of D-Day, where -- that was the site of the U.S. invasion with our allies that liberated a continent and also was a place that has been the site of remarkable sacrifice by the Greatest Generation of Americans. And the President has paid tribute on two different occasions over the course of his presidency to those Americans. The President has visited the site of the USS Arizona Memorial in the past, on a previous visit to Hawaii. But I'm confident the President will mark the day this year.\nQ: Lastly, I want to ask you about presidential pardons. What's the timeframe, what's the timetable like on something like that? Is that something that happens January 19th? Is that something that will happen on his way out the door on the 20th? How does that work out?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, the President had an opportunity to talk about this a little bit back in August when your colleague Gregory asked him about this at the Pentagon. And the President indicated that there is a process in place to evaluate clemency petitions that have been put forward. And the President has granted clemency to hundreds of Americans who have sought a commutation of their sentence. And this is part of what the President believes is an effort to chip away at some of the injustice that exists in our criminal justice system.\nIt's not a substitute for more wide-ranging criminal justice reform that unfortunately does not look like it's going to happen before the end of the year. But when it comes to pardons, they'll be carefully considered in the context of the same kind of process, and they'll be announced when the President has made a decision. I don't have a timeframe to provide at this point.\nAnita.\nQ: I just wanted to follow up on a question you got about Cuba. You said it wasn't -- it's not so easy to change the Cuba policy. This is referring to the President-elect's tweet this morning that he might terminate the deal.\nBesides the economic impact that you're saying is already happening, why is it not so easy? I mean, lot of reporting has been done in the last couple days, actually, that it is pretty easy to do that. So is it just the economic impact? Or is there something else you're referring to?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, let's just take the example of flights. There will soon be 110 daily scheduled commercial flights between the United States and Cuba. Clearly, a variety of U.S. airlines have invested significant money in infrastructure both in Cuba and the United States to facilitate those flights. Many Americans signed up for tickets to board those aircraft before they depart. There are large companies in the United States -- cruise operators and hotel operators -- that have invested significant sums of money in investing in infrastructure and doing other work to do business down in Cuba. So unrolling all of that is much more complicated than just the stroke of a pen.\nWhat's also true is the American people clearly like the opportunity that they have now to more easily travel to Cuba. They like the opportunity that they have now to bring Cuban cigars and Cuban rum home with them for their personal enjoyment. And based on the strong support that exists on the island nation of Cuba for this policy, it's hard to explain why you would roll it back if you say that your interest is advancing the interests of the Cuban people.\nClearly the Cuban people don't agree that rolling it back advances their interests. So that's going to require at least some explanation, if that's the path that the President-elect chooses. But he'll obviously have an opportunity to make his case to the American people.\nAnd I left out another good example, which is part of this normalization was making it easier for Cuban Americans to send money home to their family members in Cuba. Telling Cuban Americans -- who in some cases are actually the base of your political support -- that they can't send as much money to their own family members in Cuba who desperately need it, that they can't send money to their family members who are, in some cases, using that money to start a business and to engage in exactly the kind of entrepreneurship that we're hoping to facilitate on the island nation of Cuba.\nAgain, I think it's hard to explain or justify why that's a policy that anyone would pursue, particularly if that's a policy that some of your strongest supporters benefit from. But again, the incoming President -- because of the executive authority that he wields -- will have an opportunity to make this decision. But the complications are large.\nAnd the fact is this policy is one that -- it has not just been implemented by the U.S. government. It's actually a policy that's been implemented by the American people and by U.S. businesses that have sought to take advantage of some of these opportunities and develop commercial relationships.\nThere are significant agricultural interests in the United States that long for the opportunity to expand their commercial operations in Cuba. So explaining to them that they're going to have roll back those plans -- even if they've committed significant sums of money to invest in those plans -- again, I think is one that may be hard to explain.\nMichelle.\nQ: It sounds like you have a lot of doubts that much will change then, even though -- I mean, what you hear from analysts is that they expect at the very least a change in trajectory, is how some are saying it, coming from the new administration and the new Congress. But you seem to --\nMR. EARNEST: You're just talking about specifically on the Cuba policy, or you're talking about more generally?\nQ: On Cuba policy.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay.\nQ: So -- but you seem to cast doubt on there being much change there.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think for all of the reasons that I have laid out, the prospects of scrapping the deal are rather remote if for no other reason than it would be extraordinarily complicated and costly to do so. It also is difficult to explain if you claim that you have the best interest of the Cuban people in mind, but an overwhelming majority of Cuban citizens actually supports the policy.\nSo again, all of that is very difficult to reconcile. And I think this goes to actually something that the President talked about quite a bit on his recent overseas trip, which is that there is a difference between making pronouncements as a candidate for office and actually doing the difficult work of governing, as the President described it. Sometimes, all too often, reality intrudes. I think this in some ways is as good an example as any.\nQ: Even though -- I mean, one of the names we just saw as part of the State Department's landing team is somebody who is pretty hardline, anti-Castro and against normalization. So if those are the initial people who are going there to make that transition, you still feel pretty confident that there's not going to be much change, or a change in trajectory, as some analysts are seeing it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I don't think I'm going to be in a position of predicting the future. I think what I'm merely highlighting and trying to underscore here in as much detail as possible is that it's just not as simple as one tweet might make it seem. And again, that's just an objective fact when you consider how the American people and U.S. businesses have implemented this deal in a way that has provided significant benefits to the American people and provided significant benefits to the Cuban people.\nAgain, the U.S. relationship with countries throughout the Western Hemisphere, particularly in Latin American, is as strong as it's been in generations. And all of that would be undone by the reinstitution of a policy that had failed after having been in place for more than five decades.\nSo there are significant diplomatic, economic, cultural costs that will have to be accounted for if this policy is rolled back. But this is among the many significant challenges that the incoming administration will have to carefully consider.\nQ: And speaking of that, why would you be vague on the number of conversations they've had? Why would that be something you wouldn't want to share?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, because I'm just going to protect the ability of the President and the President-elect to engage in confidential consultations. So I think that's simply it. The President-elect indicated his intent to seek the advice and counsel of the President of the United States, and that's something that he's done on a number of occasions.\nQ: Is that something that President Obama did with outgoing President Bush? Did President Obama call him a number of times to have discussions?\nMR. EARNEST: No, I'm not aware that that occurred. I can't detail all of the conversations that occurred between President-elect Obama and then-President George W. Bush. But I'm not aware of the kinds of telephone consultations that have occurred in the context of this transition.\nQ: Okay, so this is President Obama helping out somebody that he said was unfit for office not that long ago, and said all kinds of things about on the campaign trail. So given that they've had these conversations, does the President have more confidence in the ability of Donald Trump to run the country?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware that the President has changed his assessment. But I can tell you that the President is committed to living up to the responsibility that he has as the President of the United States to put the interest of the country ahead of his own political preferences.\nAnd the President didn't support President-elect Trump in the race. In fact, he endorsed his opponent and campaigned aggressively for his opponent. But the votes were cast, and they were counted. And within 36 hours, President-elect Trump was sitting in the Oval Office next to President Obama in a meeting that lasted 90 minutes that ended with a public statement by the President-elect indicating that he hoped to have many future conversations with President Obama.\nAnd that is a very good illustration of President Obama's deep commitment -- despite their strong political differences -- to facilitating the kind of smooth and effective transition that will give the incoming President the best opportunity to succeed in uniting the country and in moving our country forward.\nQ: So a few weeks ago, before all of these lengthy phone conversations took place, you and the administration stood by the things that President Obama had said on the campaign trail. Now, after those conversations, do you still stand by those?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware that the President's assessment has changed. But the election is over, and the President is focused on his institutional responsibilities as President of the United States to preside over a smooth and effective transition to the next administration -- even though the next President is not one that he has supported politically.\nQ: And even though you say the election is over, there are many people who feel that the election is not over. And the recount efforts have also been called far-fetched and frivolous. During the campaign, the President many, many times expressed his confidence in the integrity of the electoral system, his doubts that there could be hacking, or widespread illegality of voting or anything like that. So that doesn't sound like the stance that would support a recount.\nGiven those things that he said about integrity and how the system is run, does he feel like these efforts might be too much, or over the top?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, the President does have confidence in the way that the election system in this country is run. And part of what is required of any election system is providing for a recount when the law stipulates that one can be requested. And the President's expectation is that, consistent with the smooth functioning of our election system on Election Day, is ensuring that the recount system functions smoothly, according to the law, when justified by a narrow victory by one side or the other. And the President's expectation is that everybody will follow the rules and regulations, and that this recount will occur on a timeframe envisioned by the law.\nQ: Before the election, the President criticized Donald Trump's -- what was interpreted as foreshadowing that the election would be contested, or there would be calls for recounts, and now that is happening on the part of Democrats. Does that seem like the tables have just turned and it's kind of the same principle?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think it's -- I'm not sure it's the same principle because I think there is a difference between unfounded claims of fraud and a conscientious interpretation of the recount law that is consistent with the rules that Democrats and Republicans alike apply in a situation where there's a narrow victory by one candidate or the other.\nQ: Thanks.\nMR. EARNEST: Bob.\nQ: Hey, Josh. Maybe you can answer this: Was the President-elect's phone call to the President -- and I believe it was on Saturday --\nMR. EARNEST: It was on Saturday.\nQ: -- was that prompted by the death of Fidel Castro?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware that it was, no.\nQ: Nice try. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: It was a good shot, though.\nQ: Excellent try.\nMR. EARNEST: Lana.\nQ: No, no, no, I'm not finished.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay. (Laughter.)\nQ: I have a follow-up.\nMR. EARNEST: I'm sorry. I thought that blowing kisses to the audience was an indication -- (laughter) -- some sort of universal symbol that I'm done asking questions. My mistake.\nQ: In truth, is the death of Fidel Castro almost irrelevant in some ways to the trajectory of how things are going at the moment right now?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, that's a provocative question primarily because we're talking about a figure in Cuban history that had a profound impact on the history of his island nation and on his nation's relationship with the United States. And obviously some of that -- at least some of that impact includes a treatment of citizens that's inconsistent with the kinds of rights and norms and values that we go to great lengths to protect in this country.\nBut what I can say -- and the observation I made earlier -- is I'm not aware that the United States is going to do anything differently in pursuit of our normalization policy today that we weren't doing the day before Fidel Castro's death.\nI can't speak to what sort of impact this may have on the way that the Cuban government will pursue this policy. Obviously, it was a joint agreement between the United States government and the Cuban government to pursue this normalization policy, so you'd have to talk to them about whether or not they would make any changes based on their trajectory after the death of Fidel Castro.\nLana.\nQ: The Hill is reporting that President Obama encouraged Hillary Clinton to concede the election. Can you confirm if the President called her prior to her call to Mr. Trump?\nMR. EARNEST: I saw that report. I can tell you that President Obama did have a conversation with Secretary Clinton on Election Night. I'm not going to get into the content of their conversation either. I think the one observation that I would make is that Secretary Clinton, after having spent more than a year waging a tireless campaign across the country for the presidency, is going to make her own decision about whether or not she's prepared to concede the election.\nAnd I suspect, though I haven't spoken to anyone on her staff, that she would take some umbrage at the suggestion that anybody is going to dictate to her how she should handle that situation. And I think the way that she did handle it -- particularly in the statement that she delivered the morning after the election that was characterized by so much grace and poise and statesmanship, that was obviously a very difficult time for her given the surprising outcome -- is a testament to her character and her leadership, and I think is a testament to the fact that she handled this situation based on what she believed was right, and based on what she believed was in the best interest of the country.\nAnd I think there's ample public evidence to indicate that that's how -- that that's what she was motivated by. And I think that, frankly, is what has drawn her so many compliments, even by people who didn't support her politically.\nQ: So just to be crystal clear, you dispute the characterization of The Hill article, but not the facts?\nMR. EARNEST: I think what I will say is I don't have anything to add to characterize the content of the telephone conversation. I can tell you that the President did call Secretary Clinton on Election Night, but I can't shed any light on the content of their conversation. I can just tell you that when I was reading the story, my reaction was that in a situation like that, nobody is going to tell Secretary Clinton what to do. She's going to decide what to do. And what she decided to do was to put the interest of the country first, even at a very, very difficult time for her personally.\nQ: Is Ambassador Caroline Kennedy being considered to represent the United States at Fidel Castro's funeral? And if so, what message would that send about America's past and future relationship with Cuba?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have any news to make on the U.S. delegation to Mr. Castro's funeral. I can't even confirm that there will be one at this point. But if there is one, we'll certainly announce who will lead it and who will participate in it. And we can talk about it then.\nQ: When do you expect to make a decision or have something to announce?\nMR. EARNEST: My understanding is that the funeral is tomorrow, so we have to --\nQ: I know -- that's why I'm wondering what's your timeline, Josh. (Laughter.)\nMR. EARNEST: So soon. (Laughter.)\nQ: And then finally, you said to Michelle twice you're not aware that the President has changed his assessment regarding Mr. Trump. But we've also heard from Mr. Trump that, with the interactions that he's had with President Obama, that he's come to change his opinion. He thinks more fondly of him. He likes him more than he thought he would. So you're saying that that's not reciprocated by the President?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think mostly what I was referring to is the rhetoric and argument that the President was making in advance of the election in support of Secretary Clinton and raising concerns about Mr. Trump's campaign. And the observation that I have made is that the President's mind hasn't changed, but his responsibilities have because an election has occurred, and the American people have decided that President-elect Trump should succeed President Obama.\nAnd the President's institutional responsibilities to ensure a smooth and effective transition supersede any specific political preference that he has, even on something as significant as the presidency of the United States.\nFor his personal feelings in terms of -- or his assessment of the personal relationship that he has with President-elect Trump, to be honest with you, I haven't really talked to him about that. But maybe one of you will have an opportunity to ask him about that at some point in the future.\nFrancesca.\nQ: Is it safe to say that the President won't be attending Castro's funeral given the timing and everything you've said today?\nMR. EARNEST: That is correct. The President will not be traveling to attend the funeral of Fidel Castro.\nQ: Okay, thank you. Will the Vice President possibly be attending? Is that -- but realistically, will the Vice President possibly be attending? And would the Secretary of State possibly attend at this point?\nMR. EARNEST: So just to avoid all of the --\nQ: Just all the --\nMR. EARNEST: So I can confirm for you that neither the President nor Vice President will attend. I don't want to lead you to conclude that the Secretary of State is considering attending. What I'd want to lead you to conclude is that we'll have an announcement as soon as we can get one out about a delegation, if there is one. I will keep you posted.\nQ: Sorry, to clarify the last part where you're saying you don't want to lead me to conclude that the Secretary of State would be attending --\nMR. EARNEST: Yes.\nQ: -- you're also saying then that the Secretary of State, John Kerry, is not planning to attend, as well?\nMR. EARNEST: Stay tuned for the release.\nGardiner.\nQ: Aleppo looks like it will fall fairly soon, and fall to the government of Bashar al-Assad. Do you have any further reaction to this impending disaster, which looks like it will happen in the coming several days?\nMR. EARNEST: The Obama administration, including the President himself, continues to be profoundly disturbed at the violence that is being used against innocent Syrians in Aleppo. This is violence that is organized and executed by the Assad government with the willing support of the Russians and the Iranians.\nAnd the situation is just heartbreaking. I saw a report earlier today that the latest estimate is that there are hundreds of thousands of children in besieged locations in Syria. That's difficult to comprehend. And it's tragic. And there's no positive spin to put on a situation like that.\nWhat I can tell you is that the United States continues to work diplomatically to try to bring the violence to an end and to try to provide for routine and continuous humanitarian aid deliveries. But a solution that looks like that has remained frustratingly out of reach.\nIt doesn't mean the United States has stopped trying. If anything, we have seen Secretary of State John Kerry redouble his efforts to try to bring about that kind of solution, because we know that it's just impossible to impose a military solution on a situation like this. And, unfortunately, a diplomatic solution has been very difficult to find, as well.\nRichard.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. You insisted on the fact that it would be complicated the cost to scrap the Cuban deal. Would you say it's exactly the same and worse to scrap the NAFTA agreement? Like, it's not comparable? It's just recent there was a presidential decree, and the other one is like a treaty. It would seem it's just a complicated to get rid of.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think a trade agreement is a little bit different than the broader diplomatic normalizing of relations between our two countries. So rather than try to compare them, why don't we just talk about the NAFTA agreement.\nWhat is true is that President Obama actually did engage in an effort to try to strengthen and improve the NAFTA agreement by negotiating a Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement that included Canada and Mexico and included enforceable higher labor and environmental standards. This is the chief complaint about NAFTA is that the higher labor standards that were contemplated in the NAFTA agreement were not central to the agreement and were not enforceable.\nSo what President Obama said is basically that he was going to make good on his promise to renegotiate NAFTA. That's what we did. And he put in place an agreement that would better serve American workers, American businesses, and the American economy.\nUnfortunately, Republicans in Congress and Democrats in Congress have not acted to ratify that agreement even though most of the rest of the world has. And that is going to have pretty significant strategic consequences for the United States in the Asia Pacific region. It's going to put us at a disadvantage in that region of the world, both strategically and economically. But it also exists as a missed opportunity for improvements to be built into the NAFTA agreement.\nNow, the prospect of trying to withdraw from the NAFTA agreement will also be extraordinarily complicated. There are decades of economic and commercial ties among Mexican, American, and Canadian companies. And unraveling all of that will have profound economic consequences for the United States, both in terms of jobs that are created, but also in terms of the affordability of products that are available for sale to American consumers.\nSo this will be -- fashioning a trade policy that advances the best interests of American businesses and American workers and American consumers is a challenging one, and one that this administration spent years focused on in the context of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. And this is an agreement that was going to cut taxes on 18,000 American goods that were imposed by other countries, and this is an agreement that would for the first time have codified the kind of intellectual property protections that would serve as strong protection for American entrepreneurs and Americans businesses, including those ideas that have created a lot of jobs.\nSo this will certainly be another challenge -- I guess, this would be the one area where I would acknowledge that there's an apt comparison between the Cuba policy and the NAFTA agreement -- which is, it's easy to say that you're going to tear up NAFTA, but the way that reality intrudes on the consequences of that decision make it more difficult to achieve than it might originally appear.\nDave.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. The Heritage Foundation has come out with its new assessment of U.S. military strength, and it says that, basically, the U.S. military is only two-thirds of the size that it should be. What's your reaction to that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, David, I think the President had a rather colorful exchange about this with the Republican candidate for President during one of the debates in 2012 in which then-candidate Governor Romney cited a similar analysis, and President Obama pointed out that there are also fewer horses and bayonets in the U.S. military than there used to be. And it's an indication of the kind of advances in technology that allow the United States to maintain, by far, the strongest military in the world.\nAnd that military would be stronger if Republicans in Congress were not blocking the kind of spending reforms that our leaders in the Pentagon say that we need. These are spending reforms that would strengthen the military and save taxpayers money. But that kind of common-sense approach is one that has been opposed by Republicans in Congress, including those who claim that they oppose pork-barrel spending. That's rather unfortunate.\nSo, Dave, I think there are steps that President Obama believes would make our military stronger, but they're being blocked by Republicans in Congress right now. But the fact of the matter is, the United States military is the finest, strongest, most powerful military fighting force that the world has ever known, and is certainly more powerful and effective than any other military that is fielded by any other country in the world right now.\nQ: Donald Trump has relied on this group's assessment during the campaign about military strength. Is the President concerned that Trump will embark on a military build-up next year, in light of the President viewing that the drawdown from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan should provide the government with more money to devote to other programs?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, these will all be questions that the President-elect will have to decide. After all, he won't just be the President of the United States, he'll also be the Commander-in-Chief. And President Obama has benefitted enormously from the wisdom and advice that he has received from the civilian and military leadership at the Department of Defense. He has listened carefully to that advice. He hasn't followed it at every turn, but it certainly has influenced his thinking, and he certainly believes that the incoming President-elect would benefit from keeping an open mind about that advice in the same way that President Obama did.\nCheryl, I'll give you that last one.\nQ: Thanks. Speaking of spending, this morning Senator Lankford released his annual report, finding $247 billion in wasteful and inefficient federal spending. It's his waste, fraud and abuse report. Do you believe that there is $247 billion in wasteful spending in the government?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't seen his report. I can tell you, as I alluded to with Dave, there are at least tens of billions, if not hundreds of billions, of dollars in reforms that the United States Department of Defense would implement if it weren't for Republicans in Congress who are making much more narrow decisions based on their own political self-interest.\nSo there certainly are significant reforms that could be made that would make our country safer, would make our military stronger, and would save taxpayers money. And they're not moving forward only because of Republicans who are more focused on politics than our national security.\nSo I can't speak more broadly to Senator Lankford's report, but I can certainly tell you that we hope that Congress, maybe under a Republican President, they'll be more persuaded by the kinds of needed reforms that President Obama has long supported.\nThanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 2:21 P.M. EST", "timestamp": "2016-11-28", "title": "Press Briefing by Press Secretary Josh Earnest"}

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119735", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n**Please see below for a correction, marked with an asterisk.\n12:18 P.M. EDT\nMR. EARNEST: If you have some opportunity to turn to somebody for inspiration, doesn't Eric Schultz immediately come to mind? (Laughter.)\nQ: Eric Schultz comes to my mind.\nMR. EARNEST: Me, too. Me, too. Nice to see you all this afternoon. I do not have any announcements at the top, so we can go straight to your questions.\nJosh, do you want to fire away?\nQ: Sure. Thanks, Josh. Will the United States send a delegation to the funeral of Fidel Castro?\nMR. EARNEST: Josh, I can tell you that the President has decided not to send a presidential delegation to attend the memorial service today. I can tell you, however, that Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes will attend the service, as will the top U.S. diplomat in Cuba, Jeff DeLaurentis.\nThose of you who have been following this story closely over the last couple of years know that Mr. Rhodes has played a leading role in crafting the normalization policy that President Obama announced about two years ago. He has been the principal interlocutor with the Cuban government from the White House in crafting this policy and implementing it successfully. As a part of those responsibilities, he has the occasion to travel to Cuba occasionally to further implement this policy.\nHe actually was already planning to travel to Cuba this week, so in addition to the meetings that he already has on his schedule with the Cuban government officials and with officials at the U.S. embassy, he also will be attending the service that the Cuban government has planned for this evening. And as I mentioned, he'll be attending with the top U.S. diplomat on the island, Ambassador DeLaurentis.\nQ: So I guess it begs the question that if two high-ranking U.S. officials -- national security official who worked on Cuba, the ambassador -- are attending, how is that not a U.S. delegation?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Josh, there's a formal process where the President would designate a presidential delegation to travel to Cuba specifically to represent the United States at a foreign event. Sometimes it's an inauguration; sometimes it's a coronation; sometimes it's a funeral. That will not be taking place this time. But the United States will be represented at the event by our top diplomat on the island and by a senior White House official who will be traveling to Cuba.\nQ: What was the thinking behind not designating a formal delegation?\nMR. EARNEST: Obviously, Josh, so much of the U.S. diplomatic relationship with Cuba is quite complicated. There are many aspects of the U.S.-Cuba relationship that were characterized by a lot of conflict and turmoil not just during the Castro regime, but we continue to have some significant concerns about the way the Cuban government currently operates, particularly with regard to protecting the basic human rights of the Cuban people.\nSo we believe that this was an appropriate way for the United States to show our commitment to an ongoing, future-oriented relationship with the Cuban people. And this is an appropriate way to show respect, to participate in the events that are planned for this evening, while also acknowledging some of the differences that remain between the two countries.\nQ: Josh, does the President view flag-burning to be a protected act of free speech, and does he feel that it should remain that way?\nMR. EARNEST: The freedom that we all have to express ourselves in the way that we choose to do so is protected by the United States Constitution. Similar freedoms related to the practice of religion, speech, the institution of journalism are also enshrined in our Constitution and are worth protecting.\nThe need to protect those rights is in place to protect speech and expression not just when we agree with it but also when we find it offensive. Many Americans -- the vast majority of Americans, myself included -- find the burning of the flag offensive. But we have a responsibility as a country to carefully protect our rights that are enshrined in the Constitution.\nI know this is a bipartisan sentiment. I know that there are conservatives on the Supreme Court that share the view that I just articulated. I know that there are Democrats and Republicans in the United States Congress that share the view that I've just articulated. And it certainly is consistent with the kind of governing agenda that President Obama has pursued here in the White House during his eight years in the Oval Office.\nQ: We passed the right to burn the flag if one chooses to do so as part of a broader set of basic freedoms. You mentioned the freedom of the press and others. Is it fair then to say that the President is concerned, when he sees the President-elect saying we need to remove citizenship from people who choose to engage in that activity, about a rolling back of some basic freedoms under the next administration?\nMR. EARNEST: Josh, I'll just make an observation that many of you have made, which is that this is not the first thing that the President-elect has said or tweeted that President Obama disagrees with. So I will let the President-elect and his team discuss the words that populate his Twitter feed. They can explain or defend those positions or those views. What I can do is my best to articulate to you the President's views and the priority that he places on a smooth and effective transition.\nAnd if I spend our daily interactions here itemizing and criticizing all of the things that the President-elect does that are different than what President Obama has done, that is going to materially undermine our ability to engage in a smooth and effective transition. And since that's the priority right now, since the election was held, I'll let the President-elect's team speak to the wisdom and views and policy positions that are articulated by the President-elect.\nQ: Policy aside, a number of times in the last week or so you've noted that the method that these positions have come out from the President-elect have been Twitter. Are you suggesting that maybe it would be wiser, given the stature of the office, for the President-elect to be tweeting less or to be finding another way to sort of communicate some of these positions?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't mean to do that. I think what I've observed is that, since the election, this seems to have been the principal method that the President-elect has used to communicate with the American public and to communicate with all of you, with the exception of at least one off-the-record meeting that he held with journalists in New York last week. So I don't mean to make that reference pejoratively because the truth is President Obama has found Twitter to be a useful mechanism for communicating with the American public and providing some insight to all of you about what he's thinking about.\nAt the same time, President Obama has not relied just on Twitter to communicate with the American public and interact with all of you. Over the course of the President's foreign trip, for example, when he traveled around the world, meeting with world leaders, talking about some of our highest national security priorities, the President, over the course of that trip, convened three different news conferences to answer your questions and to speak to all of you about those meetings and about the way that he was representing and advancing our interests around the globe.\nInteracting in that form with the independent media is not just valuable, it also is part of the job. And President Obama takes that part of his job quite seriously. And it's something that we've done extensively during his time here in office.\nBut obviously the President-elect and his team will have to develop a communications strategy that they believe is most effective to informing the American public and is also consistent with the expectations that the American people have about transparency and accountability for those in positions of authority. And part of that is an individual in a position of authority submitting or even subjecting themselves to skeptical questioning from an independent news media. That's a valuable and critically important part of our democracy, and, in fact, the success of our democracy depends on it.\nRoberta.\nQ: The President-elect is going to name -- or nominate Congressman Price as his HHS Secretary, and Congressman Price has for a long time been promoting an alternative to Obamacare. And I'm wondering what the White House's assessment is of his ideas about the alternatives that he has presented to Obamacare.\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know if a formal announcement has come from the President-elect's team, but --\nQ: There has.\nMR. EARNEST: There has been?\nQ: Yes.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay. So what is clear is that the President-elect has chosen to nominate someone to be his Secretary of Health and Human Services who is an ardent opponent of the Affordable Care Act and somebody who says he is committed to repealing it.\nWe have heard comments from the President-elect and from Congressman Price about some of the ideas that they say would work if implemented. And I spent a little time working with my staff today to develop what I think are some metrics that all of you and the American public should apply in evaluating some of the proposals that may be put forward by the other side.\nHere's why this is important. Since the day the President signed the Affordable Care Act into law in March of 2010, he indicated an openness to working with Republicans or Democrats to implement ideas for further strengthening the law. So the President has always welcomed good ideas either from Democrats or Republicans to strengthen the law.\nThe problem has been that the only kinds of ideas that have been put forward by the Republicans, to the extent that they have put forward any ideas -- and there have not been many -- but when they have, they actually have been ideas for undermining the law, not strengthening it. And those were primarily methods of political communication making a political argument, not for actually governing the country. But as the President observed in the context of a couple of those news conferences I referred to earlier, reality has a way of intruding once you enter the Oval Office and you assume the awesome responsibility of governing the greatest country in the world.\nSo I'll move expeditiously here, but I can whittle it down to five metrics that you can use to evaluate their proposal, and I think what you should measure it against is the progress that we've made through the Affordable Care Act in the six years or so that it's been in effect.\nSo let's start. Number one -- this is the one that you guys have written about the most. Since the Affordable Care Act went into effect, 20 million Americans have gotten health insurance. And according to a recent survey, 91.1 percent of Americans now has health insurance. That is an insured rate that's higher than it's ever been. So when these new ideas come forward, it's important to evaluate whether or not -- what impact that would have on the percentage of Americans that have health insurance, because, after all, expanding access to health care coverage was one of the principal goals of the Affordable Care Act.\nNumber two -- another principal goal of the Affordable Care Act was holding down the rapid growth in health care costs. And this was a problem that has bedeviled policymakers for at least a generation, is that the growth in health care costs was higher than the growth of other aspects of our economy. And the Affordable Care Act has actually had a positive impact in holding down that growth in health care costs. And let me just give you the best metric to evaluate.\nIn 2016 -- fiscal year 2016, which just ended a couple of months ago -- the growth in employer-based health insurance premiums was 3.4 percent. That is much lower than it was before the Affordable Care Act went into effect. In fact, between 2010 and the decade before the Affordable Care Act went into effect, employer premiums grew on average of about 7.9 percent. So we've cut the growth in health care costs by more than half.\nSo, again, evaluating the proposals from the other side should take a look at what impact they have in limiting the growth in health care costs. And again, in 2016, the growth in employer-based insurance premiums was 3.4 percent, which is at or near all-time lows.\nThe third thing that is among the benefits of the Affordable Care Act are a whole range of consumer protections, many of which even Republicans say that they like. So the proposals put forward by the other side should be evaluated based on whether or not those proposals remain in place.\nSome of these include ensuring that Americans can no longer be discriminated against because they have preexisting conditions. Before the Affordable Care Act, women could be charged more by their health insurance company for no other reason than the fact that they are women.\nBefore the Affordable Care Act went into place, many Americans were subject to lifetime limits on the benefits they could collect from their insurance company. The problem for a lot of -- for many families is that if kids were sick at an early age, by age 10 or so, they would essentially be reaching the cap on the lifetime benefits that they could collect from their parents' insurance company, which basically meant that these kids were going to be without insurance. Those caps were eliminated because of the Affordable Care Act. And we'll have to evaluate whether or not those who vow to repeal the Affordable Care Act can protect those important consumer protections that are now in place.\nThe other one that's gotten a lot of attention is that, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, young Americans can stay on their parents' insurance until age 26, and that provides an important buffer for many young Americans. When they get out of college before they get settled in a job over the long term, they can enjoy the protection of being on their parents' health insurance. So another consumer protection enjoyed and praised by Democrats and Republicans. We'll see if Republicans can do the important work to keep it, and their ability to do so should be part of the way in which their proposals are evaluated.\nJust two more. The first is, what impact will the law have on Medicare? The Affordable Care Act went into effect and the life of Medicare was extended by 11 years. There's still more work to do to strengthen and extend the life of Medicare, but you'll recall that when President Obama took office, the prediction was that the Medicare trust fund was going to run out of money by 2017; 2017 is a month from now, and the life of Medicare has been extended because of the Affordable Care Act by more than a decade. So it certainly will be important to ask questions if and when there is a proposal from the other side what impact their plan will have on strengthening Medicare.\nAnd the last thing -- and I cite this only because this is what Republicans most like to talk about -- and that's the deficit -- what impact will their proposal have on the deficit? What I can tell you that the CBO has concluded is that the impact of the Affordable Care Act on the deficit is to reduce the deficit by $3 trillion in the next 20 years -- trillion, with a \"t\" -- a $3 trillion reduction in the deficit over the next 20 years. So that certainly sets a pretty high bar for evaluating the budget impact of a proposal from the other side. But that is an important metric, one that Republicans have long prioritized. And if and when they put forward their own proposal, it should be measured against the kind of progress that the country has made under Obamacare.\nSo I appreciate you indulging me with a long answer, but this is the kind of thing that I can certainly understand why this may not end up in the stories about Mr. Price's -- Congressman Price's nomination today, but at some point, if he makes good on his word, at some point, maybe in the next year or so, he will be standing at this podium, in this room, in front of all of you, unveiling a new health care plan. And so I hope -- I'll be counting on all of you to just take a look at my notes and if you are -- or take a look at notes from this briefing -- and maybe it can serve as some questions that are worth asking about the new proposal.\nQ: So I don't want to go on too long --\nMR. EARNEST: I already have, which I apologize.\nQ: But have you evaluated Congressman Price's proposal by these metrics? Or do you have -- does the White House have an evaluation of his proposals, which have been out there for a long time?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, with all due respect to Congressman Price, what he's going to learn is that when he's the Secretary of Health and Human Services, it will be his job to implement the President's plan, not his own.\nSo we'll certainly take a close look and we'll be interested to see what proposal is put forward by the Trump administration. But I certainly have laid out for you the progress that we have made under Obamacare, and we'll see if \"Trumpcare\" measures up.\nMichelle.\nQ: Thanks. So in the past, you've expressed optimism and the President himself expressed optimism after the first time he met with President-elect Trump in the Oval Office that he may keep parts of Obamacare. Now, with Tom Price coming in as the head of HHS, do you still have that optimism? Or do you think that a lot of this -- Republicans, and these people in particular, are aware of the metrics that you cited, but there's still that mantra of repeal and replace. So do you still have that optimism, even with this pick that is coming?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think time will tell. I think what I said to Roberta certainly applies -- that with all due respect to Congressman Price, his responsibility will be to implement President Trump's health care plan, not Congressman Price's health care plan. And we'll see how it measures up. There will be an opportunity for us to evaluate it.\nAnd, look, Michelle, we have said all along, as I mentioned from the day the President signed this bill into law, the President indicated an openness to good ideas, including from Republicans, for strengthening our health care system and strengthening the Affordable Care Act. Those ideas didn't really materialize. But President Trump is taking office with certainly what he feels is strong support from the country to make some significant changes, including making changes to the Affordable Care Act. And he will -- we'll see how his proposals measure up to the progress that we have made in the United States, thanks to the Affordable Care Act.\nQ: But given what is being said now and by whom, do you still have that optimism? Does the administration have an optimism that this is going to be a good idea by your standards?\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I'm reluctant to predict exactly what's going to happen under the new administration. They'll have an opportunity to put forward their own ideas, and they'll have an opportunity to put forward ideas that they think, for example, in this case, will strengthen the health care system in this country. And fortunately, we've had an opportunity to try it the way that President Obama advocates and we've got some statistics that indicate the real progress that we've made, the way the system has been strengthened because of these reforms. We'll see if reforms implemented by the Trump administration measure up.\nQ: Often when you're -- I mean, you keep being asked about the same kinds of things and you always add reality has a way of intruding.\nMR. EARNEST: It does.\nQ: So it sounds like you have a lot of doubt that what's being said out there is actually going to come to fruition. And does that include this whole flag-burning thing?\nMR. EARNEST: I think what I'm trying to convey, and I think what the President is trying to convey when he talks about the intrusion of reality is he's talking about his experience in the job. And President Obama's experience is that the job is harder than it looks, particularly even harder than it looks when you're campaigning for it. And reality has a way of intruding on your ability to do everything that you'd like to do.\nNow, I think President Obama's record, doing many of the things that he would like to do, is quite good, and the Affordable Care Act is as good an example of that as any. But you certainly can't do everything that you would like to do. And look, that's been the experience of all 44 Presidents of the United States. Each of them has encountered a reality that they may not have anticipated that has limited their ability or checked their ability to do exactly what they want. Some of that is built into our system. That's part of a democracy and the need to compromise. In other cases, it's a function of real-world events, because, after all, nobody is governing in a vacuum.\nI think that contributes to my reluctance to predict exactly what the Trump administration will do and how President Trump will act and what priorities President Trump will pursue. I'll let his team speak to that. And I think it's difficult to predict primarily because as all 44 Presidents of the United States have learned, reality has a way of intruding on some of the rhetoric that sounded really good during the campaign.\nQ: When you hear repeated defenses of Donald Trump statements that people who burn flags should be prosecuted, is that not much of a concern to the administration right now?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think there is a pretty strong bipartisan consensus across the country that the constitutional right to freedom of expression is one that's worth protecting. And so, again, part of that free expression is being able to say whatever you want on Twitter. So there's a little irony associated with this particular situation. But freedom of expression, freedom of religion, freedom of the press -- those are freedoms that are worth protecting.\nQ: I guess this bubbling up again over flag-burning -- it doesn't bother you?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, it certainly is not consistent with the kind of priority that President Obama has placed on protecting constitutional -- our freedoms as citizens. So I'm not standing here prepared to defend or agree with those statements. But again, this is not the first time that the President-elect has said or tweeted something that is quite different than President Obama's approach. It was the hallmark of his campaign -- he ran vowing to aggressively do things differently than President Obama has, and we'll see how it works.\nOlivier.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Back on the Castro event. You're not suggesting that Mr. Rhodes and Mr. DeLaurentis are attending this in a private capacity, right? They are representing the United States?\nMR. EARNEST: That's correct. And I think if I was unclear about that, yes, they will be representing the United States at the memorial service this evening.\nQ: During this transition period, when the President makes changes to, say, the number of troops in Iraq and Syria, or makes other significant national security decisions, do you loop in the President-elect's team? Is there a mechanism or a structure for saying, hey, by the way -- not submitting it for approval, but just to say, hey, by the way, we're going to be moving \"x\" number of troops from here to there? And is there a threshold for what kinds of decisions get read out to the incoming team?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Olivier, as you point out, there is one President and one Commander-in-Chief at a time, and President Obama's ability to make those kinds of decisions about his view of the best interests of the country remain unconstrained by the election. He is going to make his own determination about what's best for the country and he'll abide, of course, by all the constitutional legal constraints that are in place, as he's done for more than seven years now. But he'll be President of the United States until January 20th, in which he'll hand off that responsibility to President Trump.\nOne of the priorities that this President has articulated is a commitment to a smooth and effective transition. And that transition will be more smooth and more effective if the President-elect and his team has some insight into the kinds of decisions that are being made in real time as the President-elect prepares to take office.\nSo it's hard for me to give you a lot of detail about what standard is established for something being needed to be communicated to the President-elect's team. But there certainly is an interest in helping the President-elect's team understand what kinds of decisions are being made so that they will be prepared to lead the country on January 20th.\nQ: -- a slightly different take --\nMR. EARNEST: Okay.\nQ: Is there a mechanism other than the PDB, the intelligence briefings, for reading in the President-elect's team on major national security issues?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there is a transition process. So, for example, the President-elect has designated a landing team to work closely with the National Security Council and the Department of Defense and other national security agencies to effect a smooth transition. So that certainly is a potential mechanism for providing insight into those decisions.\nAnd then, as we've discussed, there obviously is some communication that is ongoing between the President and the President-elect directly. I can't speak to whether or not some of the national security issues that you've alluded to came up in those conversations or not, but that certainly would be another mechanism for that information being transmitted.\nRon.\nQ: So on the Affordable Care Act, is the President -- are you saying that the President believes that reality is going to hit the new administration and they're going to be able to see that they can't dismantle this?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the point that I'm making, Ron, just to try to be as direct as I can about this, is that it's one thing to use rhetoric on the campaign trail that may poll well among a certain segment of the population, and saying at a rally of thousands of conservatives who are ardent political opponents of President Obama -- to stand at a podium like this and say, I'm going to repeal Obamacare. It's yet another thing to enter office and be faced with the reality that one impact of the Affordable Care Act is that the rate of Americans who are uninsured is at a historic, all-time low; or to see that the growth in employer-based premiums is actually lower than it's been in quite some time; or that these kinds of consumer protections are actually the kinds of things that Democrats and Republicans alike all across the country strongly support.\nSo the idea of repealing the law once you consider the benefits and once you have to reckon with the benefits becomes more difficult.\nQ: How engaged is the President in trying to make this argument now on a practical matter? Is he in touch with -- is he in touch with the new administration? Is he in touch with folks on the Hill? What is he doing to try and make this case, if anything? Or is he just resigned to the fact that they're going to change it?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think as I've tried to lay out here, their promise to change it I think is going to be challenging. If they're at all concerned about trying to expand health care coverage, or save people money, or protect people from insurance companies that may not have their interests at heart, or to extend the lifetime of Medicare, or to cut the deficit -- if they don't share those priorities, then it will be pretty easy to come in and just knock this down and put in some other plan.\nI'm not really sure what the benefits would be, but they'll have an opportunity to make that case. I think that's my point.\nWith regard to the President, he has had a handful of conversations with the President-elect, including in the Oval Office. I'm not going to speak to the content of those conversations. There are plenty of very strong supporters of the Affordable Care Act who continue to serve in the United States Congress. And many of the kinds of changes that are being discussed by some conservatives would require congressional approval, so --\nQ: But I asked because I think there's -- among some of the President's supporters, there's a concern that in his effort to create a smooth transition he appears to be not fighting back as much of his legacy is about to be dismantled or certainly severely threatened.\nMR. EARNEST: I guess my point is --\nQ: And on this issue, that's why I asked specifically what is he doing to protect Obamacare or the Affordable Care Act? Is my characterization --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I guess the point that I'm trying to make is that the most effective way for the Affordable Care Act to succeed is to implement it effectively. And I think many of the metrics here that we have laid out indicate how effectively we have implemented it. There have clearly been some highly publicized bumps in the road, and the failure of the website on the first day of its launch was not an insignificant one. But I think the results speak for themselves.\nQ: More generally, in the final weeks, what are the President's priorities? What does he realistically think he can accomplish? And given your statement you keep coming back to about how the realities of the office set in, I imagine there's a lot of reality that's setting in now, too --\nMR. EARNEST: Sure, sure.\nQ: -- at the back end of this whole thing. And I think when asked about this before, you talked about national security and those sort of ongoing important obligations that the President has. But what else is he really trying to accomplish in the final weeks?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there certainly are some legislative priorities that we're trying to make some progress on. There are many things that are going to be left undone, unfortunately -- things like immigration reform, probably criminal justice reform. And that's more than a little --\nQ: So what's realistic?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the first thing is we've got to -- Congress has got to act on a budget. And if they don't act by December 9th, we'll have a government shutdown. I don't think anybody wants that. We certainly don't want that from here. And more than that, we don't just want to avoid a shutdown,; we also want to make sure that our men and women at the Department of Defense have the resources that they need, even in this challenging time, to succeed in their mission to protect the country.\nAnd there has been a proposal floated by some on Capitol Hill that they might consider an extension of the continuing resolution to May. That would be a big problem, and the reason that would be a problem is because it would hamstring some of the efforts that are underway at the Department of Defense to protect the country and to start new efforts, new weapons systems and other production increases that are required to ensure that our men and women in uniform have the resources that they need and the equipment that they need to protect the country.\nThere also is an important fight underway in Iraq right now against ISIL. And there are substantial resources that have been committed to that fight. The United States has a very specific role. It's different than the role that our troops were -- or different than the mission that our troops were given when President Bush was the Commander-in-Chief, but it still requires resources. President Obama has made a substantial commitment to a European reassurance effort.\nAnd these are the kinds -- I'm listing out these things because these are the kinds of things that would not be addressed through a straight CR. And I think even the Secretary of Defense can tell you how a CR through March that essentially covers six months of the fiscal year is bad enough, but extending the CR through May and having a CR in place for three-quarters of the year would have a really negative impact on the Department of Defense and would undermine some of the important work that's being done there on a regular basis to protect the country.\nSo Congress has got a responsibility here. We obviously prefer that they pass a budget. But if they resort to just a continuing resolution, we believe that that should be made -- that that should be as short as possible so that a regular appropriations bill can be passed and the resources that our men and women need can be approved.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I want to ask you about South Korea and the instability that's happening there politically right now. How does that impact the U.S. relationship with what's happening there, in particular as we make the Asian pivot, as we've talked about at length for quite some time?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, the thing I can tell you is that the United States and South Korea have been close allies for decades. And the strength of that alliance has persisted through Democratic and Republican administrations in the United States, and that alliance has persisted through different administrations in the Korean presidency as well. And that's an indication that the security relationship between the Republic of Korea and the United States is substantial and so important that it supersedes political relationships. The people-to-people ties between our two countries indicate just how important a relationship this is, and that certainly supersedes politics.\nSo the President is committed to our alliance and, just as importantly, our country is committed to maintaining a strong alliance between our two countries. Investing in that alliance advances the interests of both our countries and enhances the national security of both our countries.\nSo obviously there is a rather complicated, shall we say, domestic political situation inside of South Korea right now. That is a situation that the South Korean people will grapple with. But the ongoing alliance between our two countries is as strong and durable as ever.\nQ: Has the President been in contact with his counterpart there?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware that they have had an opportunity to speak since September. You'll recall that President Obama had an opportunity to meet with President Park in Laos in early September. They spoke shortly after that meeting on the telephone in the hours after the latest nuclear test from North Korea. I don't believe that they've spoken since then, but we can keep you updated on that situation.\nQ: What does the President think about David Petraeus and his ability to be a Secretary of State if that were to be something the Trump administration would consider? Does the President think he's the kind of man who could do that job?\nMR. EARNEST: Listen, as I mentioned yesterday, I've avoided speculating on potential Obama administration --\nQ: This is someone he knows personally.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, yes -- but let me finish. I'll work on something here for you. (Laughter.)\nQ: All right.\nMR. EARNEST: I'll try to help. Let me just stipulate, though, that I'm going to -- I'm reluctant -- as I've been reluctant to speculate on potential Obama administration personnel announcements, I'm particularly reluctant to speculate on any Trump administration personnel announcements.\nBut as you point out, Kevin, the President does know General Petraeus, and General Petraeus assumed some significant responsibilities in the Obama administration, including not just in the military but also when he left the military to serve for a period of time as the Director of the CIA. And President Obama has always admired General Petraeus's commitment to serving the country, certainly when it came to leading our men and women in uniform in a hostile situation in Iraq. At the same time, obviously General Petraeus admitted to some serious crimes. And he had to pay a price for that, both publicly and in private -- and in his private life.\nBut with regard to his potential appointment as Secretary of State, we'll leave it to the President-elect and his team to describe why General Petraeus may be a good fit for that position and why he may be under consideration for it.\nQ: It's certainly fair to say the President doesn't consider him unfit.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I don't think I'd pass judgment one way or another on a potential personnel announcement. As we've discussed earlier, General Petraeus is somebody with extensive experience in the Middle East, and he has, on occasion, served as an informal outside advisor to senior administration officials here who have sought his advice and counsel on some of the many difficult issues that our diplomats and intelligence professionals and military leaders face in that region of the world.\nThat advice was not provided through any sort of formal channel or his service on any sort of formal advisory board. But he, nonetheless, maintains some important relationships with officials here in the Obama administration. And that's an indication that he is a professional who has a lot of experience and knowledge. He's somebody who loves his country and has served his country, and he's somebody who, over the course of his career, has provided valuable advice to Presidents in both parties. But his fitness for this position is something that I'll allow the President-elect to determine.\nQ: Two quick ones. Any update on the possible strike -- I'm not sure if it's actually taking place -- up in Chicago? The SEIU is having a massive strike that could be impacting air travel. Are you aware of this? And if so, what's the outlook?\nMR. EARNEST: I've seen some of the news reports about the potential for a strike among some non-unionized workers in Chicago. I'm not aware of it having any significant impact on air travel at this point, but we can certainly check on that for you. I'm also not aware of any communication from the White House about this potential labor action.\nChip.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. On the Dakota pipeline situation, how closely is the President now following this? It really is becoming a bit of a powder keg. There already has been a fair amount of violence and there are some people who believe there could be more with the evacuation order from the governor and now a large group of veterans saying that they are going to go in and act as human shields to protect the protestors. Is the President -- there are people calling for the President to get more personally involved, for the administration to get more involved. Will they do that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Chip, I did see the statement from the governor. I think the governor at some point hastened to add that he did not anticipate forcibly removing people who are currently at that site.\nThe President was asked about this a month ago and indicated his belief that protestors have a responsibility to protest peacefully. He indicated that there's an obligation for law enforcement authorities to show some restraint. And it's important for everybody to do what they can to try to avoid a situation where people are going to get hurt. So that obviously is a top priority.\nThe President at the time indicated that there was an ongoing review at the Army Corps of Engineers, considering what sort of -- or I guess I should say whether additional engagement with tribes in the area was necessary before moving forward with the project. And that review determined that it was important for the Army Corps of Engineers to go back to the tribes and other affected populations and engage in additional conversations with them to try to address their concerns about this particular infrastructure project. So that is work that the Army Corps of Engineers is engaged in.\nThe President obviously believes that it's important for government agencies in a situation like this to carefully consider the impact of these kinds of projects on local populations. I know that this is actually often a principle that Republicans -- or at least conservatives would hold up as an important thing for the federal government to do. And in this situation, President Obama agrees. And it's important for the concerns that are raised by local populations to be taken into consideration when a significant government action like this is being contemplated.\nQ: So has he done anything to be more involved in this than what he said a month ago?\nMR. EARNEST: The President is being regularly updated on the situation. And I know that there are officials at the White House that have been in touch with the relevant agencies, including the Department of Interior. But I'm not aware of any specific presidential actions that have been taken at this point, in part because the renewed engagement of local populations by the Army Corps of Engineers is consistent with what the President believes is an appropriate next step.\nQ: One of the possibilities that was suggested a month ago was rerouting the pipeline. Where does that stand?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I can't speak for the Army Corps in terms of the discussions that they're having with the tribes in the area. I think the President's hope is that both sides will sit at the table in a constructive spirit and actually focus on trying to resolve these differences as quickly as possible. And I think the President's view is that it's in the interests of both the tribe -- the locally affected tribes and the Army Corps of Engineers to resolve these differences as soon as possible and let the project go forward.\nQ: He has no plans to get more personally involved at this point?\nMR. EARNEST: At this point, I'm not aware of any impending presidential actions. But if that changes we'll let you know.\nApril.\nQ: Josh, two quick questions. Are there any plans for any phone conversations or any meetings, face to face, with President Obama and President-elect Trump again?\nMR. EARNEST: I certainly wouldn't rule them out, but there are no -- nothing is scheduled at this point.\nQ: Nothing is scheduled. When you say you wouldn't rule it out, could it be this week, next week, and it just happened just by happenstance? How is it happening?\nMR. EARNEST: It typically happens when the President-elect telephones the White House and says that he would like to speak to the President of the United States, and the President either gets on the phone or calls him back quickly.\nQ: Has he called --\nMR. EARNEST: I can't speak to the timing of those calls.\nQ: Why can't you?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know when the calls have been placed.\nQ: Next question. But that was a valid question. Next question. How do you rate or gauge the effectiveness of a presidential policy, an initiative, particularly when it is dismantled, defunded, or taken apart not like you intended or originally placed it -- how do you gauge for legacy purposes the effectiveness of that piece of policy or an initiative?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think, April, what I would do is I'd draw your attention to a metaphor that you've heard the President use before that he likens his service in the Oval Office to a relay run, that for eight years he's had the baton, he's had the responsibility of advancing the interests of the country. He took the handoff from President George W. Bush, and he ran as far and as fast as he could over the last eight years. But on January 20th, it will be time for him to hand off the baton to the next President -- in this case it will be President Trump.\nAnd there will be an opportunity, a very clear opportunity for people to evaluate the progress that the country has made during the eight years that the President was carrying the baton. And the Affordable Care Act is a good example. And I laid out some clear benchmarks of the progress that our country has made in the eight years that President Obama was in office.\nAnd what I would encourage you to do -- and I think it's common sense -- I think this is what people are likely to do, is to compare the progress that our country has enjoyed under President Obama's leadership to the progress that our country makes after President Trump makes the changes that he's recommended.\nWe've tried it the way that President Obama has advocated. We certainly would have appreciated greater cooperation with Republicans in Congress because there is more that we could have done to strengthen the economy and to improve our country, and even common-sense things like an investment in infrastructure, reform of our tax code, and immigration reform, all of which would have had significant positive economic benefits. So we could have done more. But look, after eight years, there's no making excuses. We'll set the bar where it is, and we'll take a look at the progress that we've made on health care. We'll take a look at the progress we've made on the economy -- 73 consecutive months of job growth, 15.5 million private sector jobs over the last 80 months. There are a variety of metrics I think that will clearly indicate what kind of progress we've made under President Obama's leadership.\nThe American people voted for a candidate who was promising to radically change all of that, and we'll have an opportunity to measure the wisdom of making those changes.\nQ: And for the sake of this conversation, what was the most significant pieces of policy, executive order, or anything, initiative, that the Bush administration had -- George W. Bush administration had that this administration dismantled and there was a significant change for the better over these eight years?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, we've spent a lot of time talking about it, and I think it applies here -- the Affordable Care Act. For a hundred years, Presidents in both parties had assumed office promising to fix the health care system to ensure that consumers were better protected, to ensure that more Americans had access to health care costs, to ensure that health care costs weren't growing so rapidly, to strengthen Medicare, which is something that a more recent generation of Presidents were faced with. And by their own accounting, all those Presidents failed. They weren't able to get it done because of the enormous legislative barriers that stood in their way and because of the inherent complexity of overhauling a sector of the economy that comprises about 20 percent of our overall economy.\nSo it's substantial. But President Obama succeeded in doing it. And the results speak for themselves. And there will be an opportunity to evaluate whether or not the kinds of changes that President Trump is recommending actually do have a positive impact on the goals that Presidents in both parties have stated.\nSo we can determine whether or not the Trump administration succeeds in expanding access to coverage and limiting the growth in health care costs, and extending the life of *Medicaid [Medicare], and protecting consumers and in reducing the deficit -- all tangible benefits of the Affordable Care Act. We'll see if the changes that they vow to implement will build on that progress and increase those benefits. And if so, President Obama will be among the first to give them credit for doing so. But if not, I think it certainly will once again confirm the wisdom of the approach that President Obama has pursued.\nQ: It wasn't there before. I'm talking like things like education, or even the military, with stem cell -- different changes. What was dismantled there from when this President came and changed for the positive throughout his eight years -- dismantled from that former administration?\nMR. EARNEST: The former administration certainly was reluctant -- in some cases, unwilling -- to engage with the international community to fight climate change. The Bush administration famously ensured that the United States remained one of the holdouts from the Kyoto Protocol. That undermined that coordinated international effort to confront climate change.\nPresident Obama reversed that strategy. And as a result, we have made progress in both reducing emissions and growing our economy. And there is a lot more important work to be done on that front, and that important work is going to require the international community to cooperate in pursuit of that effort.\nJordan.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Can you tell us how this dinner last night with President Obama and the Vice President and Senator Reid came about, and tell us what they discussed over dinner?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't have a detailed readout to provide, primarily because it was a social event. And this was an opportunity for the President and the First Lady to host a private dinner in honor of Senator Reid and his impending retirement.\nOver the last eight years, the Democratic leader of the Senate has been an enormously valuable partner to the President. And last night was a small, private, social opportunity for the President and First Lady to offer some appreciation to Leader Reid for his friendship, for his partnership over the last eight years.\nQ: Was this at all on the CR or anything else like that? Or was it just social?\nMR. EARNEST: My guess is they probably couldn't get in and out of the room without talking at least a little business, but it was primarily a social event.\nQ: One last thing on the Castro funeral plans. I know there's the memorial service today, but there's a lot going on -- I know the formal funeral ceremony is taking place on Sunday. Is the United States sending anyone to that ceremony,y or is this the only event, memorial event, that is being attended by U.S. officials?\nMR. EARNEST: My understanding, at least the way that it's been described to me is this is -- the event that the Cuban government is organizing for this evening is the event where the United States will be represented by the Deputy National Security Advisor and by the top diplomat in Cuba.\nI guess I'd refer you to the embassy in Havana for greater information about whether or not there will be a U.S. presence at any of those other events. Certainly no one from the White House and no other delegation will be sent to Cuba to participate in any of the other events. But I don't know if there will be other diplomats or other officials who are based at the embassy that may participate in some other events.\nAlexis.\nQ: Josh, two quick questions. To follow up on what Olivier was asking, can you check and see -- has General Flynn had a chance to talk with Susan Rice?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know whether or not General Flynn has had a conversation with Dr. Rice at this point. What I can tell you is that there obviously is important work that's being done by the officials at the National Security Council that have been designated to engage with the transition team appointed by the President-elect. And I know that there are officials who are designated by the President-elect that have been focused on a smooth and effective transition at the National Security Council. That cooperation is underway, but I don't know if that cooperation has included a phone call between the National Security Advisor and the President-elect's national security advisor.\nQ: A question about the metrics. Before the election, we listened to President Obama tell Americans that his prediction was that Donald Trump and a Donald Trump administration could reverse -- he described it, everything he'd done is at risk. And he was quite strident in his dire predictions. Since the election and today again, yesterday, the President and your rhetoric is that -- and he even told The New Yorker he didn't expect more than 20, 25 percent of his achievements to be erased. Can those two predictions of it's going to be much harder than they imagine or they're going to take away everything -- can those be consistent? Or was he exaggerating then? Or is he exaggerating rosy eyeglasses now?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think that's a good question, Alexis. I think the point that the President was making on the campaign trail is that progress is at risk because of the way -- because of the outcome of the election. You had one candidate who was vowing to build on the progress that we've made under the Affordable Care Act -- that's not the candidate that won. The candidate that won is the candidate that's vowing to repeal the Affordable Care Act and has even appointed or somehow signaled his intention to nominate a Secretary of Health and Human Services who has been a strident critic of the Affordable Care Act. Elections have consequences. And as a result, the progress that we've made under the Affordable Care Act is at risk. There's just no denying that -- and at risk in a way that it would not have been had the election outcome been different.\nThat said, there will be some limits on the ambition that was articulated by the President-elect, just based on the need to confront the reality of the progress that we've made under the Affordable Care Act. And that's something that he'll have to grapple with in office.\nBut the risk facing the millions of Americans that benefitted from the Affordable Care Act -- and I don't just mean the 20 million who got health insurance from the Affordable Care Act, but I also mean the 150 million Americans who get health insurance through their employer who certainly are in a position where they could see their employer premiums go up more quickly than they have in the last few years, and they certainly are at risk of seeing some of these consumer protections that they benefit from now being stripped away.\nBut like I said, elections have consequences. And I think that is reconcilable with the idea that every President, when they take office, does have to deal with the reality that has a way of intruding.\nQ: I just want to clarify. The President -- and we can imagine what the good reasons were -- he did not tell voters, don't worry, if she loses, it's going to be really hard for him to do this stuff -- right? Which is what he's saying now. It's going to be really hard for this administration to undo, he's arguing, what the Obama administration achieved.\nMR. EARNEST: The President was making an argument based on risk. And he was underscoring the risk that exists if President Trump was elected because the President-elect is vowing to roll back the progress that we've made in so many areas. That risk has now been realized. That risk is present in a way that it would not otherwise have been.\nSo the President's rhetoric has, unfortunately, come to pass. And now this is a risk that our country is facing, unfortunately, a risk that the President would prefer that we not have to pile on top of the other inherent risks that any President will have to encounter. But yet that is what we face.\nThat risk is mitigated by the fact that, yes, reality has a way of intruding. But that risk is there nonetheless, and it's one that the next administration will have to deal with.\nMike.\nQ: You were speaking earlier about the important role the U.S. is taking in the fight against ISIS in Iraq, including, obviously, the battle in Mosul. There has been some concern expressed about the battle plan, the strategy there and its impact on civilian casualties. You probably have read there have been published estimates already of 600 or more Iraqi civilians already being killed in that and some controversy over whether there should be a change in the approach. Does the administration see any need to alter the approach to the battle of Mosul to reduce civilian casualties?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Mike, I've read a little bit about this. In some ways -- I would encourage you to also direct your question to the Department of Defense. They can provide you probably more tangible operational assessment of some changes that may be contemplated. But as a policy matter, why don't I lay out a couple of the considerations that factor into this.\nThe first is that in the two and a half years that ISIL has been in control of Mosul, we know that any number of civilians have been killed, executed, tortured, harassed, threatened, maimed. So it's not as if not acting to retake Mosul somehow enhances the security of the civilians who are already there. So the question really is, given that the status quo is unacceptable, how do you execute an operation that avoids unnecessary risk to the civilian population?\nAnytime you're talking about the second-largest city in Iraq, this is a pretty significant challenge. And it is why the United States spent months working closely with Iraqi security forces and with other members of our coalition to effectively plan for the operation to retake Mosul. And what we have seen thus far is effective coordination among a variety of fighting forces, Kurdish forces, Iraqi security forces, both of which are being advised and assisted by U.S. Special Forces on the ground there. And we're pleased at the kind of progress that has been made thus far.\nThe other element of the planning was actually coordinated by the United Nations to ensure that there was sufficient capacity to deal with the humanitarian situation and to deal with the possibility, even the likelihood that there would be civilians fleeing that city once parts of it had been liberated. And fleeing the city means ending up in the desert without any food, water or shelter. And that has meant that the United Nations and a variety of multilateral aid organizations and some countries have mobilized resources to make sure that that aid is readily available to people fleeing violence. And we've seen that planning be useful as thousands of civilians fleeing Mosul have been able to benefit from the shelter, food, water and medicine that's provided by the United Nations.\nBut there's more work to be done. There are more risks that will be faced. And certainly minimizing the risk to the civilian population is an important priority of this ongoing operation. But anytime you are mobilizing a large-scale military operation in an urban environment, there are going to be risks. And that risk is only enhanced when you have an organization like ISIL that is so depraved that they're willing to use innocent men, women and children as human shields.\nSo the United States and others who are involved in this operation will certainly be working to minimize the risk that is faced by civilians. But it is entirely -- it's impossible to reduce that risk to zero. And as you evaluate what sort of risk you're willing to tolerate, it's important to remember that those civilians are facing a severe risk even if the status quo were in place and even if there were not an operation underway to retake that city.\nQ: One more question. Most of the trade lobbyists and people around town have kind of given up on the TPP, particularly during this administration. When you've been asked about it in the past, you've been kind of coy about whether the administration is still trying to do anything on it. The lame duck session is starting. The President just had dinner with the Senate Democratic leader last night. Are you actually making any press to get this passed, ratified, done in the lame duck session? Or have you just completely given up on it like everyone else?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the prospects are not good. But I don't know to what extent it was discussed at dinner last night.\nCheryl.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. And this just came over -- it looks like Vice President Biden is going to be traveling to Canada to meet with Trudeau and others. Talking a lot about risk, is there any -- are there treaties or agreements or issues with Canada that maybe are at risk now? Why is Biden going to Canada?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I don't have all the details on his itinerary or all of the items that are on his agenda. As you know, President Obama had an opportunity to meet with Prime Minister Trudeau in Peru just last week -- or a week ago last Sunday, and it was a valuable opportunity for the leader of the United States to sit down with the leader of Canada, who is our closest partner on so many issues.\nSo I'll refer you to the Vice President's office for a more detailed account of what's on his agenda when he travels there. But I think, like President Obama, he certainly admires the leadership of Prime Minister Trudeau and is hopeful that the next administration will build on the strong relationship that this administration has helped to cultivate with Prime Minister Trudeau and the Canadian people.\nLana.\nQ: The memorial service and the funeral Sunday -- I just want to clarify one thing on that. Will the same U.S. non-presidential delegation be attending the funeral? Can we assume that Ben Rhodes and ambassador -- or DeLaurentis will also be in attendance at the funeral?\nMR. EARNEST: They are only participating in the memorial service that's planned for tonight. The briefing that was provided to me is that the actual funeral itself is actually a private event. But I can tell you that this is the only event that the Deputy National Security Advisor is planning to attend.\nQ: Ohio State yesterday -- does the President condemn that as an act of terror?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously, I should start by saying that we owe a deep debt of gratitude to the first responders who reacted so heroically to the situation there. There are indications that the suspect was neutralized within a minute or two of beginning this terrible act of violence. And that's thanks to the bravery and professionalism and skill of some of the law enforcement officers who responded so quickly to the scene.\nSo we obviously -- this is yet another opportunity for us to remember how professionally and how bravely men and women in police officers' uniforms all across the country work to protect us so well every day.\nWe also are deeply appreciative of the response that was mobilized by EMTs and doctors and nurses in the Columbus area. Again, based on the briefing that I received this morning, it's likely that there will be no loss of life in this incident other than the perpetrator. And we obviously are thinking about and praying for a swift recovery for those who were harmed in this incident.\nMore generally, I can tell you that law enforcement officers, with the support of the FBI, are conducting a thorough investigation of this situation to learn as much as they can about the potential motive of this individual. It's important that those investigators uncover as much as they possibly can to learn about this incident and to learn what we can do to try to prevent it from taking -- an event like this from happening again.\nThere are a couple of things, though, that we know. The first is that there is plenty of available evidence to indicate that this individual may have been motivated by extremism and may have been motivated by a desire to carry out an act of terrorism. And we know that our law enforcement officers have a critical role to play in preventing those acts of terrorism from succeeding. There are more than a hundred joint terrorism task forces that are organized in communities all across the country that fight crime, that fight extremism, that fight terrorism on a daily basis. And it's important that we give them the support, financial and otherwise, to do their important work.\nIt's also important for us to make sure that we're investing in programs to counter violent extremism. These interagency task forces, some of which are mobilized, are organized at the federal level and work closely with state and local officials, law enforcement and community leaders, to fight efforts to radicalize people in this country is critically important. And this administration has poured more resources and devoted more time and attention to the success of these programs than anyone else. And that reflects our desire to adapt to the current threat picture.\nWhat's also true and what we also know based on some of the information about this perpetrator that has been made public is that our response to the situation matters. And I don't mean our response as a government. I mean our response as a country to this situation matters. And if we respond to this situation by casting aspersions on millions of people that adhere to a particular religion, or if we increase our suspicion of people who practice a particular religion, we're more likely to contribute to acts of violence than we are to prevent them.\nSo our response matters. We'll let our investigators determine exactly what led to this event, but even as we're waiting for additional information, we should be mindful of that response.\nQ: And then, the Southern Poverty Law Center released a report that 2,500 acts of harassment and intimidation were reported by teachers, invoking either President-elect Donald Trump or his campaign rhetoric. Is this -- how concerning is this to the President?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think what we've seen is that the recently concluded presidential campaign was a hotly contested one and, unfortunately, a campaign that was characterized by a lot of divisive rhetoric. And it was going to be the responsibility of the winner of that election, whether it was Secretary Clinton or Donald Trump, to put at the top of his or her agenda uniting the country and healing the country in the aftermath of that election.\nAnd there are a lot of ways to measure or evaluate the impact that this recently concluded election had on our country. But the President is certainly hopeful. And the President certainly tried to do his part by setting aside his own political views and focusing on a smooth and effective transition to lay the groundwork for the next President to take office and actually succeed in beginning to bring the country together once again after a divisive election. And the President is genuinely hopeful that the next President will make that a priority and that he will succeed in doing that.\nPam.\nQ: Josh, thanks. The President-elect has had positive things to say about his dealings with President Obama in the Oval Office meeting and phone calls. Does President Obama view his discussions with his successor as an opportunity to maybe use his powers of persuasion to get him to back off of a lot of the things he said on the campaign in terms of changing Obama policies?\nMR. EARNEST: I think President Obama views those conversations as an opportunity to offer some advice and to consult with the President-elect as he prepares to assume the awesome responsibility of governing the greatest country in the world. That's the nature of their phone conversations.\nI'm going to protect their ability to have private consultations, so I won't be able to get into the topics that are covered or more precisely discuss the nature of their conversations. But President Obama does feel an obligation and believes that it is one of his most important remaining tasks to ensure a smooth and effective transition from the Obama administration to the Trump administration. And if that transition can be facilitated by telephone conversations between the President and the President-elect, then President Obama will participate in them accordingly, and he will offer the best advice that he possibly can to the incoming President.\nCharlie.\nQ: Just a quick question. Has the President had the opportunity to speak to the Ohio State police officer that helped neutralize the attack yesterday?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know that they've had a chance to talk at this point, but if a conversation like that occurs, we'll let you know.\nAnd, Fred, I'll give you the last one.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Yeah, just following up on some issues about what Trump might change. Has the President expressed any concern about what a Trump Supreme Court would look like and how that would affect some of the legacy?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm not aware that the President has spoken to this, either publicly or privately. I think the President's expectation is that President Trump will fill vacancies on the Supreme Court by appointing people who are quite different than the kind of people that President Obama appointed. That may be one thing that everybody across the country can agree on.\nIt certainly doesn't discount the President's deep disappointment at the way Republicans in the Senate treated Chief Judge Merrick Garland. Chief Judge Garland has been waiting for consideration by this Senate for almost a year. And he is the most experienced Supreme Court nominee in American history when you consider his 19 years on the federal bench. He was somebody who served his country in prosecuting the perpetrators of one of the worst acts of terrorism on American soil when he helped lead an investigation and a prosecution of Timothy McVeigh after the Oklahoma City bombing. Chief Judge Garland is somebody that both Democrats and Republicans have said is somebody with a brilliant legal mind. And even Republicans have acknowledged that he's a consensus pick.\nAnd yet, Republicans in the Senate refused to do their basic job and even give him a hearing and even give him a vote. And that's deeply disappointing. And, look, I don't know if that will -- if they will change course between now and January 20th. I suspect they will not. And I don't know at this point who President Trump would choose. He certainly would -- I think he could in good faith -- well, look, he'll obviously have the opportunity to choose whomever he would like. And we'll see how they're treated in the Senate.\nQ: Two more quick ones. Would the President plan on any executive actions -- or does he just believe that those will just be instantly overturned at this point?\nMR. EARNEST: Can you repeat your question? There was a key word in your question that I missed and I want to make sure I don't screw it up.\nQ: Does the President plan on taking any executive actions before leaving office to solidify some policies? Or does he just believe those would be instantly overturned once the Trump presidency has started?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, the process of acting on an executive order, Fred, as you know, is -- an executive action or an executive order is one that requires a lot of preparation. And so I'm not going to rule out additional executive actions that the administration may take between now and January 20th -- after all, the President of the United States is the President of the United States until January 20th. But what I can rule out are any sort of hastily added executive actions that weren't previously considered that would just be tacked on at the end. But are there some actions that have been in the pipeline for quite some time that could be announced between now and January 20th? That possibility certainly exists, but I don't have anything to preview at this point.\nQ: Trump made, of course, quite a bit of news last week when he indicated there wouldn't be prosecution of Hillary Clinton. Given that, does the Obama administration take his word on that? And is there no chance of a pardon of Secretary Clinton for any possible offenses or anything that the Trump administration might go after her for?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Fred, I did get asked about this last week or the week before. And the point is that there's a long tradition in the United States of ensuring that we separate criminal investigations from politics. And there are a lot of good reasons for that. Primarily the reason for it is to make sure that people aren't left somehow with the impression that they'll be treated differently in our criminal justice system based on their political affiliation.\nOur tradition in this country is that everybody is treated equally under the law, and that's a tradition that's worth upholding. And in the case of Secretary Clinton, her use of a private email system was thoroughly investigated by career investigators at the Department of Justice and the FBI. And what the FBI Director concluded is that in the context of the investigation that no reasonable prosecutor would move forward in seeking charges against her. That was a recommendation that he forwarded to officials at the Department of Justice, and officials at the Department of Justice agreed with his recommendation.\nSo given that the FBI Director is somebody who was a registered Republican, who served in the senior Department of Justice position in a Republican administration, somebody who was confirmed with strong majorities in the United States Senate by Democrats and Republicans, I think it's an indication that politics did not play a factor into their conclusion. And that's a good thing.\nQ: So for what Trump might do later if he does try to launch an investigation, or his Justice Department would, you don't think there would be a need for the President to pardon her before leaving?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think I'd just refer you to what the FBI Director had to say, which is that no reasonable prosecutor would seeks charges against her.\nQ: -- federal help in Tennessee, Josh?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I can tell you, Kevin, I appreciate you asking. Obviously, the folks in Tennessee are dealing with a quite serious wildfire situation there right now. I can tell you that FEMA has already responded by providing a fire management assistance grant to the state of Tennessee to help them mobilize the resources that are necessary to fight the fire.\nThe one piece of good news that we have is that meteorologists are predicting some rain in the area in the next 24 to 48 hours. That obviously would be a welcome development and would hopefully hasten the extinguishing of that fire.\nThanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow.\nEND 1:37 P.M.

Luetkemeyer, R-MO)\nThe Administration strongly opposes H.R. 6392, the Systemic Risk Designation Improvement Act of 2016. Actions taken in the years since enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) are curbing excessive risk-taking, closing regulatory gaps, and making our financial system safer and more resilient, for both markets and consumers. H.R. 6392 would severely weaken these reforms, put in place to discourage dozens of the Nation's largest banks from engaging in the risky behavior that precipitated the 2008 financial crisis. We have made great progress as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, and we cannot afford to return to the days of deregulation and lax oversight.\nThe financial crisis revealed grave weaknesses in the Nation's financial regulatory framework. By passing and signing the landmark reforms of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Congress and the President, respectively, took significant steps to limit risks to financial stability and protect taxpayers from the consequences of such risks. Because of the Dodd-Frank Act, the financial regulators have better tools to deal with financial shocks when they occur, and are able to protect Main Street and taxpayers from Wall Street's recklessness. The law, among many other risk controls, provides the prudential regulators, and in particular the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, the ability to apply enhanced prudential standards to bank holding companies with more than $50 billion in total consolidated assets. In conjunction, the law provides for a rigorous stress-testing regime, along with capital, liquidity and living will requirements, to better ensure that financial institutions are prepared for severe economic circumstances. Only a financial system strong enough to withstand a major financial shock is capable of promoting sustainable economic growth.\nBank holding companies of all sizes were already subject to the Federal Reserve's supervision prior to enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. In light of the greater risks posed by the Nation's largest banks as exhibited in the financial crisis, the Congress directed the Federal Reserve to simply apply stricter and escalating prudential standards to these few institutions with more than $50 billion in total consolidated assets. This crucial underpinning of Wall Street reform better positions our regulators to shed light on emerging threats and reduce the likelihood of another financial crisis.\nH.R. 6392 would eliminate the $50 billion threshold, impairing the application of enhanced prudential standards to trillions of dollars of assets managed by dozens of the Nation's largest banks. Under H.R. 6392, only eight U.S. global systemically important banks would be subject to enhanced prudential standards without further action by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC). All other bank holding companies – including more than 20 large regional banks, each with more than $50 billion in assets and some that played a significant role in the financial crisis and received taxpayer support – would have to go through an extensive process and be individually designated by the FSOC as a precondition for increased oversight. While an extensive designation process is appropriate for nonbank financial companies that would be newly regulated by the Federal Reserve, such a process is inappropriate for bank holding companies already supervised by the Federal Reserve. The new administrative burden imposed by H.R. 6392 would only distract the FSOC from focusing on its mission to proactively identify and protect against risks in the financial system before they wreak havoc on the Nation's economy. Requirements that impede the ability of regulators to apply common-sense safeguards in a tiered and tailored manner to large financial institutions only expose taxpayers to the very risks that led to the financial crisis.\nThe President has been clear about his opposition to any legislation that would weaken or reduce oversight of the financial system. H.R. 6392 would hamper oversight of dozens of the largest banks in the country and drastically roll back necessary provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act, hamstringing regulators charged with monitoring and regulating the largest financial institutions and reverting to deficient, pre-crisis standards.\nIf the President were presented with H.R. 6392, his senior advisors would recommend he veto the bill.", "timestamp": "2016-11-29", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 6392 - Systemic Risk Designation Improvement Act of 2016"}
{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119752", "text": "STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY\n(House Rules)\n(Rules Committee Print)\nThe Administration strongly supports passage of the bipartisan House Amendment to the Senate Amendment to H.R. 34, the 21st Century Cures Act, which dedicates more than $6 billion to implement key priorities such as the President's proposal to combat the heroin and prescription opioid epidemic; the Vice President's Cancer Moonshot; and the President's signature biomedical research initiatives, the Precision Medicine and Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiatives. It also takes important steps to improve mental health, including provisions that build on the work of the President's Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Parity Task Force, and includes policies to further modernize the drug approval process.\nThe legislation includes $1 billion over two years, including $500 million in Fiscal Year 2017, to combat the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic, consistent with the President's budget request. More Americans now die every year from drug overdoses than they do in motor vehicle crashes, and the majority involve opioids. The opioid epidemic is devastating families and communities and straining the capacity of law enforcement and the healthcare system. The resources included in the bill will allow states to expand access to treatment to help individuals seeking help to find it and to start the road to recovery, with preference given to states with an incidence or prevalence of opioid use disorders that is substantially higher relative to other states.\nThe Administration is committed to taking immediate action to lay the groundwork to ensure that the funds in the bill would be disbursed quickly and effectively so we can begin to address these important public health challenges.\nThe bill also includes $1.8 billion, including $1 billion over the next three years, to support the Vice President's Cancer Moonshot. The Moonshot aims to accelerate research efforts and make new therapies available to more patients, while also improving our ability to prevent cancer and detect it at an early stage. The resources in this legislation will support investment in promising new therapies like cancer immunotherapy, new prevention tools, cancer vaccine development, novel early detection tools, and pediatric cancer interventions. As the Vice President and scientific experts have said, we are at an inflection point in cancer research and this investment could help seize this opportunity.\nThe legislation also dedicates support for other key research initiatives. In 2013, the President launched the BRAIN Initiative with the goal of helping researchers find new ways to treat, cure, and prevent brain disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and traumatic brain injury. In 2015, he launched the Precision Medicine Initiative to pioneer a new model of patient-powered research that promises to accelerate biomedical discoveries and provide clinicians with new tools, knowledge, and therapies to select which treatments will work best for which patients. The bill creates dedicated funding of $1.5 billion for the BRAIN initiative and $1.4 billion for the Precision Medicine Initiative to continue these signature Presidential Initiatives, which have broad bipartisan support, over the next decade.\nThe legislation also includes bipartisan mental health reforms. These include a renewed emphasis on evidence-based strategies for treating serious mental illness, improved coordination between primary care and behavioral health services, reauthorization of important programs focused on suicide prevention and other prevention services, and mental health and substance use disorder parity provisions that build on the work of the President's Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Parity Task Force.\nIn addition, the bill takes multiple steps to further the progress made in this Administration in improving the drug development process. It enhances the ongoing efforts to better incorporate patients' voices into the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) decision-making processes; supports FDA's efforts to modernize clinical trial design; and improves FDA's ability to hire and retain scientific experts. The legislation includes strong protections for individuals' health data, as well as provisions preventing unnecessary restrictions on the sharing of health information technology data with patients and providers.\nThere are also provisions in the bill that raise concerns, but that have been modified from previous versions to help address concerns, such as provisions that allow for the marketing of drugs to payors for off-label uses. In addition, a number of effective dates will be challenging to meet, especially without additional administrative funding. The requirement to sell additional inventory from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, when added to the sale requirements of the Bipartisan Budget Act and the FAST Act, continues a bad precedent of selling off longer term energy security assets to satisfy near term budget scoring needs.\nThat said, this legislation offers advances in health that far outweigh these concerns. As such, the Administration strongly supports passage of the House Amendment to the Senate Amendment to H.R. 34, the 21st Century Cures Act.", "timestamp": "2016-11-29", "title": "Statement of Administration Policy: House Amendment to the Senate Amendment to H.R. 34 - 21st Century Cures Act"}
{"author": "Michelle Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=120927", "text": "MRS. OBAMA: Hi, everybody! Look how good you guys look. You ready for some action?\nAUDIENCE: Yes.\nMRS. OBAMA: Are you sure? I don't know, you sound like you don't want cookies or anything like that. (Laughter.) You think you want some cookies? You think so? Okay, well, we're going to get to it, but first I want to welcome everyone to the White House.\nI want to start by thanking Hazel for that wonderful introduction and for all of her service and hard work in helping to make this home so beautiful. I want to give a huge thank you to all of the volunteers, as Hazel mentioned, who traveled here from 33 states, D.C., and Puerto Rico to come here and put up these beautiful decorations and transform this White House into this holiday wonderland. So I'm so grateful to you all.\nAnd as we celebrate my family's last holiday season in the White House, I'm thinking back to when we first came here to Washington and we promised to open up this house to as many people from as many backgrounds as possible. And we truly wanted to make the White House the \"People's House,\" particularly during the holiday seasons. And over the past eight years, through the seasons, we've worked hard to achieve that goal by welcoming almost a half million guests to this house during the season. And thanks to our amazing volunteers, we've adorned the White House with about a half million ornaments for our guests to enjoy, and we've brought smiles to the faces of all those who enjoyed the 200,000 holiday cookies prepared by our outstanding pastry chefs. And you all will get to have some more of those today. That will make 200,020 or so.\nSo, looking back, I am proud to say that we did our very best during the holidays to make Americans of all backgrounds and walks of life feel comfortable and welcome here in our nation's house. Now, we do all of this with the help of our extraordinary staff. I mean, yes, we have wonderful volunteers, but we have folks who, each year, take a very limited budget and very little resources, and they make miracles happen in this house.\nSo, for our final holiday preview, I just want to take a moment to highlight just a few of the amazing folks who have worked tirelessly behind the scenes. And I don't know if they know I'm calling them out -- I don't even know if they're in the room. But I want to start with Deesha Dyer, who is the office -- our Social Secretary.\nMS. DYER: I'm here. (Laughter.)\nMRS. OBAMA: Deesha, there you are. There's Deesha. (Applause.) Thank you, Deesha. And you're going to see Cris Comerford and Susie Morrison. Cris is our Executive Chef and Susie is our Executive Pastry Chef. I want to thank them both, as well as all of the chefs, all of the staff in the kitchen who worked so hard to do everything possible to make these holidays terrific.\nI want to thank all of our ushers who never get credit. I know they're around here working away, but they're the people who greet you, and they make sure that things are moving like they should in this house -- our florists, who are tremendous. And I rarely get to thank our electricians, our carpenters, because they make sure that chandeliers are moved and structures are built so that we can put things on, and they do this in a matter of days. They turn this house upside down. And to our calligraphers -- you'll see all their handiwork throughout the ornaments. And I also always want to thank our incredible Marine Band, who you hear from throughout the season. My husband's favorite musical crew are his own Marine Band.\nThis is all possible because of all of these people. And on behalf of the entire Obama family -- me, Barack, Malia, Sasha, Grandma, Bo and Sunny -- (laughter) -- we are so proud of this team here, so proud of the time that we spent with you. We're grateful for everything you've done for us over the years. So let's give them a round of applause. (Applause.)\nSo before I get choked up, let me officially kick off our final White House holiday season. And as always, today, we are celebrating with our extraordinary military community, our military families. We have our servicemembers. We have veterans here today. We have wounded warriors. We have our military spouses! (Applause.) You go, spouses. And of course, we have our outstanding, handsome, beautiful, smart, talented, engaging military kids. Are there any here? Oh here they are. (Laughter.) Let's give them all a round of applause. (Applause.)\nFor the past eight years, celebrating the holidays and having you all be the first that see the decorations, this has been one of our favorite White House traditions. It reminds us that between all the shopping lists and the travel plans and all those big meals, that we cannot forget what the holidays are really about, and you all help us. Our military families like all of you remind us of what matters. Because even as you serve this country in uniform, or you hold everything together here at home as a military spouse, or you prepare to attend another new school as a military kid --\n(A baby in the audience interrupts.)\nMRS. OBAMA: -- and there's that one back there talking about I don't know what, but there's a little one back there who has a lot to say. (Laughter.) But you all still find time to contribute even more to your communities and to this country.\nYou do it all. You volunteer at local food banks. You coach your kids' sports teams on the weekends. Many of you have even cut your Thanksgiving holiday short to come here and decorate the White House.\nJust another example -- we have Hazel up here -- but one of our volunteers, her name is Jacqueline James. She's from Redlands, California. Is Jacqueline here so we can really embarrass her? She's probably still working. We're going to do another reception for our volunteers later. But let me tell you a little bit about Jacqueline.\nDuring her husband's 22 years in the Army, her family -- she and her family, they spent the holidays in five different states and even on a base overseas. During that time they managed to raise seven kids. And just two weeks ago, they celebrated the birth of their fifteenth grandchild. But their family's service to this country did not end when Jacqueline's husband retired, as they watched two of their sons do tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan. And even though Jacqueline doesn't consider herself the most artistic decorator, she volunteered at the White House this year because -- and this is what she said -- she said, \"If patriotism is an art,\" she said, \"then I am a master.\"\nIt's that kind of commitment to serving others, that's what the holidays are truly about and that's what we honor with our holiday decorations every year at the White House. And this year's holiday theme is \"The Gift of the Holidays.\" And as usual, we're going to be celebrating our country's greatest gifts with special decorations celebrating our military families.\nDown in the Booksellers, when you walk in, the visitors that come will see a tree and a flag display composed of pictures of military families who my husband and I have met on bases and in communities around the world over the course of our time here. The tree is hung with gold ornaments honoring America's greatest heroes, the men and women who have given their lives for our country. And right next to those displays is an iPad station that allows guests to send holiday wishes to our servicemembers, and we are hoping that each of the 68,000 guests that are going to visit during the holiday season will take a moment to pause and send a message to express their gratitude.\nAfter that, they'll move on to see a number of other decorations that celebrate the gifts we share as a nation. For example, in the Library, we're honoring the gift of a great education -- which is important, right, school, college, all of that. And we have trees in the Library made out of crayons and pencils, so you have to check that out if you haven't already. And to raise awareness about the millions of adolescent girls around the world who are not able to attend school, we've got two trees that are decorated with special ornaments, each of which has the word \"girl\" written in one of a dozen different languages.\nSo when guests head upstairs to this floor, they're going to see that, in the Green Room, it's filled with decorations representing the gifts provided by our White House Kitchen Garden with trees hung with ornaments in the shape of bees and fruit. And of course, right next door, we have our 19-foot-tall White House Christmas tree. It's really big. They have to take out the chandeliers and rearrange everything just to get the tree in the house. And that's in our Blue Room. And in the State Dining Room, you're going to spot the official White House gingerbread house. So when you see it, guys, it's made of all -- everything on it is something you can eat. And our pastry chefs have worked very hard to make this house possible. It is beautiful. They've got the replica of the new White House garden, and Bo and Sunny, and lots of cool stuff.\nNow, the trees in that room -- there are 56 LEGO gingerbread houses representing every state and territory in America. And then somewhere around the house, we have supersize replicas of Bo and Sunny guarding their presents, because we don't let them have their presents. (Laughter.) I'm just kidding, they get presents. They're fine.\nAltogether, the folks who come through these halls over the next few weeks will see about -- how many ornaments do you think are in this house?\nCHILD: Six.\nMRS. OBAMA: Six? (Laughter.) Ten?\nCHILD: A hundred.\nMRS. OBAMA: A hundred? Getting closer.\nCHILD: Nine thousand.\nMRS. OBAMA: Nine thousand?\nCHILD: Two hundred.\nMRS. OBAMA: Let me tell you, it's 70,000 ornaments. I was pretty shocked at that.\nSo we can't wait -- that's a lot of ornaments. But we can't wait to start welcoming people into their White House this holiday season. And to everyone who created these stunning displays, all our volunteers, all our -- all the folks who help make this happen, I want to once again say thank you. You all did a phenomenal job once again in turning this house into a magical place.\nAnd to all the military families, those of you who are here today and all those around the world, I want to once again honor you for your service and your sacrifice and your love of this nation. It's a lot that my family and I share along with you. It has been such a complete pleasure to support you in this time.\nSo I want to wish everyone a happy, healthy holiday season, all right? And with that, we get to have some fun, okay? Are you guys ready -- I'm just talking to the kids here. (Laughter.) You guys don't get to have fun, but here's what you get: We will take your children from you for a moment. (Laughter and applause.) Don't applaud too loudly. They're still here. They can hear you. (Laughter.) And you can enjoy some cider and some cookies.\nAnd you guys want to come with me? We've got some surprises in the back, and your parents will be here. We'll try to bring them back in one piece. I can't guarantee that they will be neat. (Laughter.) There is dye and food color -- sorry. (Laughter.) All of it is washable!\nAll right, you guys ready to come and join me? You all, thank you all so much. Come to the White House. It's really cool. Take care.", "timestamp": "2016-11-29", "title": "Remarks by the First Lady at the Annual Holiday Press Preview"}

Policy. The Federal Government benefits from a workforce that can be recruited from the broadest and deepest pools of qualified candidates for our highly competitive, merit-based positions. The recruitment and retention of workforce participants who serve in the Foreign Service of the Department of State under a Limited Non-Career Appointment under section 309 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980, Public Law 96-465 (22 U.S.C. 3949), as amended, are critical to our ability to meet consular staffing levels (now in substantial deficit) and thereby enhance our capacity to meet high national security standards and efficiently process visas in accordance with our policy of \"open doors, safe borders.\" Program participants undergo a rigorous merit-based evaluation process, which includes a written test and an oral assessment and to which a veteran preference applies, and develop advanced- to superior-level skills in languages and in cultural competence in particular regions, skills that are essential for mission-critical positions throughout the entire Federal workforce.\nExecutive Order 13597 of January 19, 2012, sought to ensure that 80 percent of nonimmigrant visa applicants be interviewed within three weeks of receiving an application. The Department of State's ability to maintain this 80 percent benchmark will come under increasing pressure in the future given current and projected staffing shortfalls through 2023. These staffing gaps could adversely affect the Department of State's ability to sustain border security and immigration control at peak efficiency and effectiveness, which will have effects on tourism, job creation, and U.S. economic growth. Use of the Limited Non-Career Appointment hiring authority will provide flexibility to address, for the foreseeable future, both this increased demand and recurring institutional and national needs across the Federal Government.\nAccordingly, pursuant to my authority under 5 U.S.C. 3302(1), and in order to achieve a workforce that represents all segments of society as provided in 5 U.S.C. 2301(b)(1), I find that conditions of good administration make necessary an exception to the competitive hiring rules for certain positions in the Federal civil service.\nSec. 2. The head of any agency in the executive branch may appoint in the competitive service an individual who served for at least 48 months of continuous service in the Foreign Service of the Department of State under a Limited Non-Career Appointment under section 309 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980, and who passes such examination as the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) may prescribe.\nSec. 3. In order to be eligible for noncompetitive appointment to positions under section 2 of this order, such an individual must:\n(a) have received a satisfactory or better performance rating (or equivalent) for service under the qualifying Limited Non-Career Appointment; and (b) exercise the eligibility for noncompetitive appointment within a period of 1 year after completion of the qualifying Limited Non-Career Appointment. Such period may be extended to not more than 3 years in the case of persons who, following such service, are engaged in military service, in the pursuit of studies at an institution of higher learning, or in other activities that, in the view of the appointing authority, warrant an extension of such period. Such period may also be extended to permit the adjudication of a background investigation.\nSec. 4. A person appointed under section 2 of this order shall become a career conditional employee.\nSec. 5. Any law, Executive Order, or regulation that would disqualify an applicant for appointment in the competitive service shall also disqualify a person for appointment under section 2 of this order. Examples of disqualifying criteria include restrictions on employing persons who are not U.S. citizens or nationals, who have violated the anti-nepotism provisions of the Civil Service Reform Act, 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(7), 3110, who have knowingly and willfully failed to register for Selective Service when required to do so, 5 U.S.C. 3328(a)(2), who do not meet occupational qualifying standards prescribed by OPM, or who do not meet suitability factors prescribed by OPM.\nSec. 6.

Participants in these programs develop advanced- to superior-level skills in languages and cultural competence in regions that are strategically, diplomatically, and economically important to the United States. It is in the interest of the Federal Government to retain the services of these highly skilled individuals, particularly given that the Federal Government aided them in the acquisition of their skills.

Title 5, United States Code, authorizes me to implement alternative pay plans for pay increases for civilian Federal employees covered by the General Schedule and certain other pay systems if, because of \"national emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare,\" I view the adjustments that would otherwise take effect as inappropriate.\nCivilian Federal employees made significant sacrifices as a result of the 3-year pay freeze that ended in January 2014. Since the pay freeze ended, annual adjustments for civilian Federal employees have also been lower than private sector pay increases and statutory formulas for adjustments to the General Schedule for 2014 through 2016. However, we must maintain efforts to keep our Nation on a sustainable fiscal course. This is an effort that continues to require tough choices under current economic conditions.\nUnder current law, locality pay increases averaging 28.49 percent and costing $26 billion would go into effect in January 2017. Federal agency budgets cannot sustain such increases. In my August 31, 2016, alternative pay plan submission, I noted that the alternative plan for locality payments will be limited so that the total combined cost of the 1.0 percent across-the-board base pay increase and the varying locality pay increases will be 1.6 percent of basic payroll, consistent with the assumption in my 2017 Budget. Accordingly, I have determined that under the authority of section 5304a of title 5, United States Code, locality-based comparability payments for the locality pay areas established by the President's Pay Agent, in the amounts set forth in the attached table, shall become effective on the first day of the first applicable pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2017.\nThe locality-based comparability payments for the locality pay rates in the attached table are based on an allocation of 0.6 percent of payroll as indicated in my August 31, 2016, alternative pay plan for adjustments to the base General Schedule.

Trump today announced his intent to nominate Steven Mnuchin as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Treasury, Wilbur Ross as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Commerce and Todd Ricketts as Deputy Secretary of Commerce. This team will be instrumental in implementing the President-elect's America First economic plan that will create more than 25 million jobs over the next decade.\nMr. Mnuchin has decades of financial management experience including serving as Chief Information Officer at Goldman Sachs as well as finance director for President-elect Trump's presidential campaign.\n\"Steve Mnuchin is a world-class financier, banker and businessman, and has played a key role in developing our plan to build a dynamic, booming economy that will create millions of jobs,\" said President-elect Trump. \"His expertise and pro-growth ideas make him the ideal candidate to serve as Secretary of the Treasury. He purchased IndyMac Bank for $1.6 billion and ran it very professionally, selling it for $3.4 billion plus a return of capital. That's the kind of people I want in my administration representing our country.\"\n\"I am honored to have the opportunity to serve our great country in this important role. I understand what needs to be done to fix the economy. I look forward to helping President-elect Trump implement a bold economic agenda that creates good-paying jobs and defends the American worker,\" said Mr. Mnuchin.\nSince 2004, Mr. Mnuchin has been the Founder, Co-Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Dune Capital Management, one of the country's premier investment firms, specializing in public equity markets, real estate and the entertainment industry. He also founded OneWest Bank Group LLC in 2009 and served as its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\nPrior to that, Mr. Mnuchin worked for 17 years at Goldman Sachs, where he oversaw trading in government securities, mortgages, money markets, and municipal bonds and rose to become the company's Chief Information Officer.\nMr. Mnuchin has extensive experience in investing and financing the entertainment business. He founded RatPac-Dune Entertainment, which has produced wildly successful films, including Avatar, the highest grossing film in history ($2.8B worldwide), American Sniper, the X-Men series and many more.\nHe is a Member of the Board of The Museum of Contemporary Art Los Angeles (MOCA), UCLA Health System Board, New York Presbyterian Hospital, the Los Angeles Police Foundation, and Life Trustee of New York Presbyterian Hospital. Mr. Mnuchin has a bachelor's degree from Yale University.\nIn addition, President-elect Trump announced his intent to nominate Wilbur Ross as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Commerce, a man renowned for his extraordinary business career and economic expertise.\n\"Wilbur Ross is a champion of American manufacturing and knows how to help companies succeed. Most importantly, he is one of the greatest negotiators I have ever met, and that comes from me, the author of The Art of the Deal. Together, we will take on the special interests and stand up for American jobs,\" said President-elect Trump. \"Wilbur knows that cutting taxes for working families, reducing burdensome government regulations and unleashing America's energy resources will strengthen our economy at a time when our country needs to see significant growth. I am proud to nominate him as Secretary of Commerce.\"\n\"I am delighted to have been selected to join President-elect Trump's Cabinet and look forward to working especially closely with Steve Mnuchin to implement the economic programs which we have developed jointly to implement the President-elect's strategy for accelerating our economic growth,\" said Mr. Ross.\nFor 25 years Mr. Ross headed Rothschild Inc. where he built a legacy of saving jobs and restructuring failing companies back to profitability.

He received a bachelor's degree from Yale University and his MBA from Harvard University.\nIn addition to Mr. Ross' nomination, President-elect Trump announced his choice of Todd Ricketts, co-owner of the Chicago Cubs, to serve as Deputy Commerce Secretary.\n\"Todd Ricketts is an immensely successful businessman with unparalleled knowledge of the finance industry,\" said President-elect Trump. \"As Deputy Commerce Secretary he will help us cut waste and streamline government so that it works for the people of America. The incredible job he and the Ricketts family did in the purchase and turnaround of the Chicago Cubs – one perfect step after another, leading to the World Championship, is what I want representing our people. I am very proud to have him on our team.\"\n\"I am honored that President-elect Donald J. Trump has asked me to serve our country at this critical juncture in our history.

{"author": "Josh Earnest", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=119734", "text": "James S. Brady Press Briefing Room\n12:20 P.M. EST\nMR. EARNEST: Good afternoon, everybody. Nice to see you all. I do not have any announcements at the top, so we can go straight to your questions. Darlene, do you want to start?\nQ: I have a couple different topics today.\nMR. EARNEST: Okay.\nQ: First, Donald Trump this morning said that he was going to be stepping away from the business to focus on running the country, because that's more important. And I was wondering if that announcement comes as welcome news to this White House.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Darlene, ultimately the relevant observers here will have to conclude based on the details of the announcement once it's been made. So there's obviously an Office of Government Ethics that is charged with significant responsibilities in terms of ensuring that government officials are adhering to ethical standards. Certainly, Congress has oversight responsibilities that should transcend partisan loyalty. Congress has an institutional responsibility to provide oversight, even if it is a Republican-led Congress and Republican-led Oversight Committee. They have responsibilities of providing oversight, even if it's a Republican-led administration.\nIn addition to that, all of you are going to have to spend some time demanding transparency and demanding some answers to tough questions. And I know at least the people in this room are pretty good at that. And ultimately the American public will be counting on you to get answers to determine whether or not the questions that have been raised or the questions that may still persist in their mind have been satisfied based on the steps that the President-elect will announce. None of that is for me to judge.\nWhat I can tell you is what President Obama's approach has been, and it has simply been to abide by an extraordinarily high standard of not just following the letter of ethical requirements, but following the spirit of those ethical requirements, and even going to great lengths to avoid even the appearance of a potential conflict of interest. For example, when President Obama took office, he, with the exception of his home in Chicago, basically liquidated his assets and purchased Treasury bonds. He did that at a time when interest rates in this country were at historic lows. It was not a particularly lucrative investment, you might say. But the President was willing to put his own financial interests aside and focus on running on the country. And he benefitted from that. He's obviously not been implicated or involved in any sort of personal scandal.\nHe's demanded that the same kind of standard be met by people who have served in this administration. And I think that's why you've seen, over eight years, thousands of people have served in the Obama administration, and there's been no major and personal scandal among a senior official in the Obama administration. And that's because of the commitment -- at least in part because of the commitment -- to this high ethical standard. But ultimately, the President-elect will have to determine what sort of standard he will abide by and what sort of standard he'll ask those who serve in his administration to abide by.\nQ: House Democrats have reelected Nancy Pelosi as their leader. Is there any comment from the White House on that? I know the President was very positive about her at the news conference in Peru when he got a question about it. Is there anything more to add?\nMR. EARNEST: Not really -- primarily because this is a decision for House Democrats to make in terms of how best to organize themselves and who should lead their caucus. The President has spoken on more occasions than I can count about how this country and his administration has benefitted from the kind of leadership and toughness and character that Leader Pelosi has demonstrated throughout her career in the House of Representatives, but particularly over the last eight year in which she served in a leadership position while President Obama has been in office. They haven't agreed on every issue, the President and the Democratic Leader in the House, but they have been able to work effectively together. And the President himself has said on many occasions that so many of the accomplishments of this administration would not have been possible without the skill, toughness, values, and leadership of Nancy Pelosi.\nQ: Finally, the President has a meeting this afternoon with the Nobel Laureates. Is it a practice to invite all of the prize-winners to come to meet with the President? Can you say who will be attending that meeting?\nMR. EARNEST: What we have done every year is we've invited those Americans who have been awarded a Nobel Prize to come and visit with the President prior to the -- prior to traveling to Norway to accept the prize.\nSo the President is looking forward to renewing that tradition again. And I believe that several of the winners, but not all of them, will be in attendance at the White House. Those of you who are wondering, unfortunately Bob Dylan will not be at the White House today, so everybody can relax.\nBut we can get you a list of those who will be participating in that greet with the President later this afternoon.\nQ: Did Bob Dylan give a reason for why he can't be here this afternoon?\nMR. EARNEST: He didn't. I know that he has indicated publicly that he's honored to have received the Nobel Prize, but I know that he's also indicated that he does not intend to travel to Norway to participate in the ceremonies in which he'd be awarded the prize. Again, based on what I've seen in published reports, I think the Norwegians are hopeful that he'll choose another time over the course of the coming year to travel to Norway and give a speech and accept his prize. But that will be up to him.\nThere have been previous occasions -- at least one previous occasion where Mr. Dylan has had an opportunity to visit the White House, and the President enjoyed meeting him there. But he'll not be here today.\nAyesha.\nQ: Thank you. So, late yesterday, Carrier announced a deal with President-elect Donald Trump to keep close to a thousand jobs at an air conditioner plant in Indianapolis. I guess all of the details of the deal haven't been announced. But I was wondering, does the White House have any thoughts on kind of the strategy that has been employed to maybe lean on a private company to get them to keep jobs in the U.S.? Is that a strategy that the White House approves of, that thinks it's a good thing to do? I guess I just wanted thoughts on that.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, obviously we haven't seen the details of the announcement from the company, but we'll obviously -- or the early indications are that this is good news. And obviously we'd welcome that good news.\nI know that the President-elect has indicated that he deserves credit for that announcement. And I guess what I would observe is that if he is successful in doing that 804 more times, then he will meet the record of manufacturing jobs that were created in the United States while President Obama was in office. There were 805,000 manufacturing jobs that weren't just protected or saved, but actually created while President Obama was in office.\nSo President Obama has set a high standard, and President-elect Trump can meet that standard if this Carrier deal is completed in the way that he expects that it will be. If he does that 804 more times, then he will have matched the standard established by President Obama -- at least when it comes to manufacturing jobs. The one difference would be that the President-elect is talking about protecting jobs, and the metric I'm using is actually creating jobs.\nIf you go to protecting jobs, there are more than a million jobs in the industrial Midwest that were saved when President Obama made the decision to rescue the American auto industry. And the long-term benefits of that fateful decision that was not initially popular has yielded a substantial benefit for the entire country, but certainly for the industrial Midwest.\nQ: But are there any thoughts on kind of like a personal intervention, the use of the bully pulpit maybe to kind of protect American jobs or keep companies from moving overseas? I mean, was there -- I guess, is there any position on whether that's a good use of the authority of the presidency?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think when it comes to the announcement from Carrier, we'll wait to see the details. But the indications are that it's good news. And we'd welcome that.\nAs it relates to the governing strategy, I think it remains to be seen whether or not that's one that can be applied to other situations. Again, the President-elect will certainly have an opportunity to lay out his strategy when it comes to the economy. But he's indicated that he intends to pursue a different economic strategy than this administration pursued. And we'll all have an opportunity to evaluate whether or not that's likely to meet the rather high bar that's been established by the strategy put forward by President Obama.\nQ: On another topic, the U.N. Security Council has imposed new sanctions on North Korea on Wednesday. I was wondering, how do these sanctions -- or is there hope that these sanctions will have an impact where other sanctions have not? How do these maybe differ? And would they be able to bring about some type of change in the North Korean regime?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Ayesha, this U.N. Security Council resolution represents weeks of hard-nosed diplomacy. In order to pass a U.N. Security Council resolution, it requires not just the approval of the United States and some of our European allies, it also includes -- or requires not just the consent but the cooperation of both Russia and China. Those are two countries with whom the United States has on occasion -- and as it relates to some issues -- a rather complicated relationship.\nBut in this case, we have succeeded in brokering a diplomatic agreement among every member of the U.N. Security Council to put forward a tough new resolution that will apply additional pressure to the North Korean regime.\nThere are a couple of things that I can cite for you, and for more details I'd refer you to my colleagues in Ambassador Powers' office.\nBut the first thing -- and I think this is the most notable one -- is that this resolution will impose a hard, binding cap on North Korea's coal exports. Coal exports are North Korea's largest source of external revenue. And we know that a significant portion of that revenue is plowed into their nuclear program. So putting in place this hard cap and closing loopholes that they've previously exploited to get around previous sanctions is a substantial development.\nThe resolution also strengthens and expands a range of sectoral sanctions on other exports from the DPRK. And these are exports, aside from coal, that the North Koreans use to raise hard currency. And when you're the subject of so many sanctions like the North Koreans are, raising that hard currency is difficult to do. We've made it even harder and applied even more economic pressure in those areas where we know that the North Koreans are using revenue to fund their nuclear program.\nAnd I think this does send a clear signal about the resolve -- not just of the United States and South Korea and Japan -- but rather of countries around the world to compelling the North Korean government to come into compliance with their international obligations as it relates to their nuclear program.\nMichelle.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. So do you think that these new sanctions have a much greater likelihood of changing North Korean behavior? I mean, where do they rank in terms of past sanctions? I know you explained the cap and the revenue streams, but what do you think in terms of this working?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, it certainly ratchets up pressure on the North Korean government in a way that they have not experienced before. This will put real pressure on the North Korean government to evaluate the strategy that they have pursued.\nI don't think anybody outside of the North Korean government can predict exactly whether or not this will lead to the kind of change in their behavior that we'd like to see. But we do know that this will increase the pressure and it will make things more difficult for the North Korean government, both in terms of leading that country, but also in terms of investing in their nuclear program. It will deepen their isolation, and it makes clear that it's getting harder and harder for them to extract much sympathy from other countries in the region.\nThis is a pretty united front. This is a united front that is being presented by the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, about the need for the North Koreans to change their behavior. Will they actually do it? Time will tell.\nQ: These are based on past sanctions and behavior continuing. If these new sanctions don't change behavior, is their still room for additional sanctions? Is that going to be the pattern for the indefinite future, do you think?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, hopefully that won't be the pattern because hopefully this will apply the necessary pressure to get them to change their behavior. We'll see. But there always is an opportunity for us to go farther.\nBut we're not putting sanctions in place as a punitive measure. We're not putting sanctions in place just for the sake of putting in place sanctions. We're putting in place sanctions with the hope that it will bring about a change in behavior for the North Korean government, and a possibility for the international community to more deeply and constructively engage the North Korean regime -- bring them out of the shadows, bring them into the international community, and actually bring relief to the millions of people in North Korea who live under an oppressive regime in extraordinarily harsh condition.\nQ: But there's going to be a point at which there's not going to be much more you can do in the way of sanctions, right? Are we reaching that point now?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think that this certainly represents a substantial escalation in pressure on the North Korean regime, and hopefully it will lead to the kind of changes that we'd like to see.\nIs there room to go further? I'm sure there always is. But hopefully that won't be necessary, and hopefully we'll see a change from the North Koreans that will address the significant concerns harbored around the world about North Korea's provocations and their willingness to shirk their international -- their responsibilities when it comes to developing a nuclear program.\nQ: Okay. And on this Carrier deal, sources are saying now that it wasn't the promise of incentives from the state to keep some of these jobs here, but it was the threat of a 35 percent tariff on Carrier's products. What do you think of that? And is that something that President Obama would have done in his attempts to build manufacturing jobs?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I'll let the President-elect's team describe what kind of strategy they are going to choose to implement. I think it's been quite clear the strategy that President Obama has sought to implement, and one of those strategies was actually predicated on successfully renegotiating NAFTA to level the playing field for American workers and American businesses so that the American economy could enjoy substantial benefits.\nAnd threats of levying additional tariffs is not a tactic that this administration chose to pursue, but we may have an opportunity to test the theory that's been put forward by the President-elect about whether or not that is a smart, sustainable strategy.\nChris.\nQ: Josh, the Defense Authorization bill that the Republican lawmakers have agreed to omits the controversial language that would have undermined President Obama's executive order barring anti-LGBT discrimination on federal contractors. Do Republicans (inaudible) for leaving out that provision?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what I can tell you is that, as of just a few minutes ago, we had actually not seen the final text of the bill yet.\nTypically, the bill is hundreds of pages long, and it takes some time to review the text of the bill and determine exactly what the consequences are of those measures. So I can't make a grand pronouncement at this point about our position on the legislation. What we have been told is the so-called Russell Amendment is not in that legislation. We'll obviously take a look to see -- to confirm that. But no, I don't think you get credit for deciding not to discriminate against somebody. I think that is behavior that we would expect of everybody in the country, particularly people who are elected to represent their fellow citizens in the United States Congress.\nQ: Assuming that is correct that it's not in the bill, to what extent is that an empty victory, considering that Republicans could just do that again next Congress without a veto threat, or President Trump could just dismantle the executive order on his own volition?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, again, I'm not going to speculate about what may happen after President Obama leaves office. Obviously the Republican-led Congress and the Republican President will have to determine what kind of policies they want to pursue. But we obviously have spent a lot of time over the course of this year talking about the fact that elections have consequences. And it's possible that this is one way in which elections would have consequences.\nQ: Do you expect the President will sign the NDAA?\nMR. EARNEST: Again, we haven't seen the text of it, but we'll obviously review it. That may take a little time. But once we've reached a conclusion about whether or not the President will sign it, we'll let you know.\nScott.\nQ: Josh, the President has been a big promoter of loan forgiveness plans for college students that tie their payments to their income. GAO has got a report out today saying that's going to be more costly than advertised; it also criticized the way that the Education Department counts for it. Any reaction to that?\nMR. EARNEST: I haven't seen the actual report. I can tell you the President has placed a priority on making sure that graduating students are treated fairly by the Department of Education and by lenders when it comes to their student loans. One idea that this administration has pioneered is the idea of income-based repayment, which essentially allows students or recent graduates to cap their loan repayments every month at 10 percent of their income. This is a way that we can ensure that graduates are fulfilling their basic responsibility to repay the government for the money that they've borrowed. But we want to make sure that when students graduate, that they're not saddled with so much debt that they're essentially penalized financially for pursuing college education opportunities.\nSo the strategy that we've put forward has benefitted thousands of students across the country. There are many thousands more that have not availed themselves of the opportunity that is part of the income-based repayment program. And so certainly if there are students or recent graduates out there that are struggling to repay their loans, we would encourage them to contact the Department of Education and learn more about income-based repayment. And we can probably, in many cases, design a strategy that allows you to keep your commitment to the government, to the American people, for the money that you've borrowed, and to get a college education, but we can do that in a way that doesn't pose an undue financial hardship as you go and try to get started on a career.\nGardiner.\nQ: Elizabeth Warren came out today and blasted the 21st Century Cures Act, saying it's a giveaway to industry, that it's corruption at its worst. The administration has been supportive of the 21st Century Cures Act before. Where are you now on the bill?\nMR. EARNEST: Gardiner, just last night we issued a detailed statement of administration policy that sort of walks through a lot of the details. So I'd refer you to that particular statement. But, in general, what I can tell you is that the legislation includes important funding for things like the President's BRAIN Initiative that would turbo-charge the amount of research that's done into the human brain. It would dedicate significant funding streams to the Vice President's Cancer Moonshot initiative, and would augment the government's ability to organize research and focus it on those projects that are likely to lead to the kind of breakthroughs that could save lives.\nThe money also -- or the bill also includes funding for offering assistance to those who are addicted to heroin and opioids. This is the epidemic of addiction that we've seen all across the country as plaguing far too many communities and families. And there has been a deficit of resources dedicated to making sure that those people who are trying to get help for their addiction can get it.\nAnd so as with any piece of legislation that is passed by a Republican Congress and signed into law by a Democratic President, it's going to require some compromise. There are some elements of the bill that the administration doesn't support. I'm confident that there are some parts of the bill that some Republicans don't support either. But at the end of day, I think the bill will get overall support from Democrats and Republicans because of some of the priorities that I've identified.\nJohn.\nQ: I wanted to ask a quick follow-up on Leader Pelosi. Did the President go out and try to whip up any votes for her, or make any phone calls on her behalf?\nMR. EARNEST: The President was not involved in the leadership race among House Democrats. The President, as he has done in previous contested party races in Congress, has essentially said that it's their responsibility to make that decision. And I think everyone is keenly aware of his warm feelings for Leader Pelosi, but ultimately it's the responsibility of House Democrats to make the decision about who should lead them.\nQ: I also wanted to ask you about any White House reaction, or reaction from the President, on the district attorney's decision down in North Carolina to not pursue any sort of charges. He said that the officer who killed Keith Scott acted lawfully. I was wondering if there was any sort of reaction to that.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, as we've discussed in other settings, John, the White House is not going to get involved in handicapping or second-guessing criminal investigations. As this investigation was opened by the local district attorney, there were statements from the Department of Justice indicating that they were going to monitor the situation in Charlotte, and so I certainly don't want to say anything that could be viewed as prejudging or getting ahead of any sort of decision that they may announce.\nBut I'm confident that my colleagues at the Department of Justice are aware of this announcement, have followed through on their commitment to continue to monitor the situation. But for any reaction, I'd refer you to them.\nQ: So DOJ's decision will be completely independent of DA account?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think the Department of Justice's decision will be independent of any sort of personal feelings that the President of the United States may have about the decision made by the district attorney. What impact the district attorney's decision has on the Department of Justice is something you should ask the Department of Justice.\nKevin.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. I wanted to ask you about the wildfires in Tennessee. Three people have died; more than 150 homes and businesses have been destroyed by the wildfires. Can you give us an update on what the administration is doing to help the folks in the state?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, obviously our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Tennessee who are dealing with a very difficult situation right now. The wildfire in that part of the country is a very serious situation and there are lives that have been lost. Less importantly, there's been property that's been lost as well. And obviously the thoughts and prayers of the entire country are with that community that has been so negatively affected by the situation there.\nThere are a couple of steps that the federal government has taken to provide support to local officials who are dealing with this situation. The first is, my colleagues at FEMA have provided a Fire Management Assistance Grant -- an FMAG -- to local officials to provide them some additional resources to deal with that situation. There also are a couple of teams of firefighting experts that have been deployed. These are experts that serve in a variety of federal agencies. Some of them are actually employed by state agencies, but they work effectively with federal partners and are actually being deployed to Tennessee to help officials there develop a strategy to make sure that -- to try to contain the fire as quickly as possible before more lives are lost and before more property is lost.\nI understand that there was some rainfall overnight, which hopefully will have at least some positive impact. But I also understand that that rainfall was accompanied by some rather high winds. So we're hoping that the weather will continue to contribute positively to extinguishing this fire as soon as possible. But obviously this is a very serious situation. And significant resources have been mobilized by the federal government to offer our assistance to state and local officials who are dealing with it firsthand.\nQ: Does this warrant a federal disaster declaration? And has the President personally been in contact with the government?\nMR. EARNEST: The President has been briefed on the situation. I don't know that he's spoken to the governor. As it relates to the kind of federal assistance that we can provide, the financial assistance through an FMAG and the technical assistance through the team of experts that I have made reference to earlier are the most immediate, urgent way for the federal government to offer any assistance.\nBut down the line, I wouldn't necessarily rule out the eventual declaration of an emergency. But we'll have to exactly take a look at the scope of the damage and make a determination from there.\nQ: I want to draw your attention to something that's happening in Syria. It has been reported that Israeli jets have executed some airstrikes in the area. I'm curious -- has the U.S. military, to your knowledge, been in contact with the Russians in terms of de-confliction in the airspace over Syria, or with the Israelis as that area continues to suffer from numerous airstrikes?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Kevin, as it relates to Israeli military action and reports of their military action, I'd refer you to the Israeli government. I won't have any comment on that.\nAs it relates to the U.S. military action inside of Syria, there is a sustained air campaign being waged by U.S. military pilots against ISIL targets in Syria. And that bombing campaign has resulted in senior ISIL officials -- including some who are responsible for external plotting -- being taken off the battlefield in the last few months. So we've applied substantial pressure to ISIL targets through a robust U.S. military bombing campaign. And there is a low-level channel that's been established with the Russians to ensure that we can successfully de-conflict our military efforts with any efforts that the Russians may have ongoing.\nThat is different than, and stops short of, cooperating or coordinating with them militarily. But we are in contact enough to make sure that our military pilots can operate free of any interference by Russians who also may be engaged in military activities in the region.\nQ: Lastly, I want to ask you a domestic question. And this is a little bit of a hypothetical, but maybe you can be instructive on it. As it relates to sanctuary cities, there has been some suggestion that the federal government could apply pressure on so-called sanctuary cities if they fail to comply with the law. That's been talked about at length as a possibility under a Trump administration.\nBroadly speaking from the Obama administration perspective, is that a good use of the federal government's cudgel, if you will, to get the cities to follow the law as it relates to immigration or any other?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, I think, Kevin, the fact that we're even having a discussion about sanctuary cities is an indication of just how broken our immigration system is. And this is a good example of why President Obama fought so hard to try to reform our broken immigration system. And he did succeed in working with Democrats and Republicans in the Senate to put forward a common-sense bill that would have made a historic investment in border security, but also made some common-sense reforms to our immigration system that would have ensured that people who have been in the United States for a substantial period of time are essentially given an opportunity to come out of the shadows.\nNow, they are in some cases asked to pay a fine. They got to pay taxes. They got to go through a background check. There are onerous obstacles that have to be overcome. But yet there is a path to resolving this situation.\nAnd failing to act on comprehensive immigration reform -- something that had bipartisan support not just in Washington, D.C. but all across the country -- there is a reason that law enforcement organizations, faith-based communities, the business community are all strongly supportive of comprehensive immigration reform. They understand the benefits that are possible, and they understand that the current system we have is broken.\nAnd the fact that there is a discussion about sanctuary cities is just one symptom of a much more significant affliction that continues to plague this country. And this is a problem that would have been solved had Republicans in the House of Representatives not blocked or prevented a vote on this bipartisan bill that had passed the Senate.\nQ: Even if I were to cede that -- and I think there's a lot there that I think most people would certainly agree with you on -- isn't it the responsibility of these cities and communities to still follow the law?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, the President has made clear that when it comes to our immigration policy, it's important for federal law to reflect that we are a nation of laws, but we're also a nation of immigrants. And it shouldn't be that hard. In fact, it's not that hard to reconcile those two important priorities. And the bipartisan legislation that advanced through the Senate with the strong support of the administration certainly did effectively balance those two priorities.\nBut the failure to balance those priorities in our federal law has a number of difficult consequences. And again, the fact that we have to talk about sanctuary cities I think is one example of that.\nQ: Last one. On OPEC apparently cutting production, is the White House aware of this? And is there a concern here that that will have a major impact on, broadly, gas prices in particular for American citizens?\nMR. EARNEST: I've seen that news report. I'm not aware of any specific briefing that the U.S. government has received on that vote. I know there have been previous occasions where there have been statements submitted by OPEC that didn't actually result in the policy change that they said that they were pursuing. So we'll obviously watch and see what impact this statement has.\nPhilip.\nQ: Thank you. On the funeral of Fidel Castro in Cuba this weekend, it's a relatively long affair. So I'm wondering whether at some point the President is expected to watch parts of the funeral. And will he be updated regularly by Ben Rhodes, who is there for the funeral?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't anticipate that the President will watch any of the proceedings on television. Mr. Rhodes and our diplomat in Cuba, Ambassador DeLaurentis, participated in a memorial service last night. But I'm not aware that either of them intends to be a part of all of the activities over the next three days. The two of them were in attendance last night representing the United States.\nBut Mr. Rhodes remains in Cuba today because he's been -- he had previously planned to travel to Cuba this week to have meetings with government officials and officials at the U.S. embassy to discuss the continued effort to implement a policy of normalizing relations between our two countries. But the last I heard is that he's actually planning to come back tonight. So I don't think that -- I know that he won't be there and participating in the events that are planned over the next several days.\nQ: Any details by any chance of who exactly those meetings were with and what they might have been about?\nMR. EARNEST: Not at this point, but when he gets back we'll see if we can get you a readout of his engagements while he was there.\nQ: The phone calls between the President-elect and the President -- you gave some details yesterday and said that, I believe all the phone calls or most of them emanated from the President-elect's office. Have there been any cases where a call has been initiated here at the White House and went to Donald Trump, to the President-elect, from here?\nMR. EARNEST: My understanding -- and again, I can't account for all of their conversations, but my understanding at least of the phone calls that have been discussed publically, those were calls that were initiated by the President-elect.\nQ: Do you expect that to even itself out a little bit from now until the inauguration?\nMR. EARNEST: I don't know. We'll have to see. But I can't guarantee that we'll be talking about those conversations publically.\nJordan.\nQ: Thanks, Josh. Senate Majority Leader McConnell said today that the Senate is going to vote on the Iran Sanctions Act this week and that's expected to pass. And I'm wondering whether President Obama would veto that bill if it reached his desk.\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Jordan, as we have said on a number of occasions, the administration continues to retain substantial authorities that can be used to impose financial sanctions on the Iranian regime. There are a variety of reasons why we would want to do that.\nThe first is, we've seen the Iranians on a number of occasions take steps with regard to their ballistic missile program that are inconsistent with U.N. Security Council resolutions. We have seen direct evidence of the Iranians sponsoring terrorism. We have seen ample evidence that the Iranians aren't living up to generally accepted norms when it comes to protecting the basic universal human rights of the Iranian people.\nAll those are reasons that Iran could be subject to financial sanctions -- and they have been. These are financial sanctions imposed by the Obama administration against the Iranian government and other Iranian entities because of our concerns about those areas. So we retain substantial authority to impose additional sanctions if they are warranted.\nWe know that there is a renewed interest -- or there is interest in Congress in giving the administration additional authority. We'll take a look at what bill is passed and determine whether or not the President will sign it. But for those in Congress who are interested in making sure the administration has sufficient authority, I can confirm that we do, and I can confirm that we have not been shy about using it.\nQ: It sounds like you think this legislation is unnecessary. Is that correct?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, there are plenty of times where the President has signed into law bills that Congress has passed that we're not sure are entirely necessary. So I would avoid reading in too much -- reading too much into my comments about whether or not the President will sign it. We'll see what Congress passes, if they pass something. And we'll let you know if the President intends to sign it.\nJean.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. Today, a U.N. Security Council resolution adopted new sanctions against North Korea. What is the difference between the (inaudible) and the new sanctions on North Korea?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, Jean, as I mentioned earlier, the most substantial difference is the new sanctions regime includes a hard, binding cap on North Korean coal exports. This is significant because we know that North Korea gets more revenue from their coal exports than anywhere else, and we know they use a substantial portion of that revenue to fund their nuclear program. So putting in place this hard, binding cap is going to limit their ability to do that.\nThere are other sectors of the economy that will also face tougher penalties and tougher sanctions. And again, we know that's important because those sectoral sanctions are related to exports and we know that exports are the best way for the North Korean regime to get access to hard currency. We know a lot of that hard currency is then used to invest in their nuclear program.\nSo there are some other steps that relate to preventing the North Koreans from generating revenue by using their real property holdings overseas. There are additional prohibitions that are put in place on public and private support for trade with the North Korean government.\nSo for a more detailed run-down on how all this would work, I'd refer you to my colleagues in the office of Ambassador Power, who has obviously done remarkable work to organize the international community around this set of sanctions that actually represents a substantial escalation in the pressure that's being applied against North Korea because of their nuclear program.\nQ: What if China rejects this?\nMR. EARNEST: I'm sorry?\nQ: Do you think Chinese will agree to this?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, our expectation is that the Chinese will agree to this. The Chinese obviously have a veto power at the U.N. Security Council. And based on this difficult, weeks-long negotiation with the members of the Security Council, the indication is that the Chinese government is prepared to support a resolution like what I've just described -- which is a good thing, an important step, and is an indication that the international community is presenting a united front in confronting North Korea for their nuclear program.\nQ: One more question. Japan and South Korea, China will hold a trilateral summit meeting at Tokyo next month. What is your comment on that?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, what we have often said is that we believe the United States benefits from our allies having a constructive, productive relationship with China. After all, President Obama meets with his Chinese counterpart with some regularity; he just did it a couple of weeks ago when we were in Peru.\nSo we obviously would welcome both greater cooperation between our South Korean and Japanese allies on a range of issues. And if they can cooperate in terms of strengthening and improving their relationship with China -- making it more productive and constructive -- there's nothing wrong with that at all from the standpoint of the United States.\nQ: Does U.S. agree with the South Korea and Japan military security agreement?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we certainly have encouraged our allies in South Korea and Japan to intensify their efforts to coordinate on a range of issues, including on a range of security issues. Again, we believe that that will enhance the national security of our two allies, and we believe that that's a good thing for the United States.\nSo the United States, including President Obama himself, has played a central role in trying to facilitate warmer, more effective relations between two of our most important allies in Asia. And we've obviously seen South Korea and Japan make some really important strides in terms of improving their relationship and having more effective coordination on a range of issues including a range of national security issues, and that's something that we have long encouraged them to do.\nJohn.\nQ: Thank you, Josh. Has the administration's effort to transfer detainees at the prison facility at Guantanamo ceased since the election -- the presidential election three weeks ago?\nMR. EARNEST: No.\nQ: And what are the plans, as it relates to the remaining detainees at Guantanamo, from this point forward, leading up to Inauguration Day?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we're going to continue to do the difficult, diplomatic spade work that's necessary to transfer as many of those detainees as possible that have been cleared for transfer by the national security experts who are viewing their case files.\nThose transfers obviously are contingent on a range of security requirements that ensure that those individuals can't pose an undue threat to U.S. national security after they're transferred. That's the reason it requires a bit of diplomacy to ask other countries to assume this responsibility. But there are dozens of Gitmo detainees that have been cleared for transfer by national security experts that have reviewed their files, and we just need to do the diplomatic work that's necessary to find an appropriate place to send them.\nQ: As you know, President-elect Trump has spoken often about how he would like to keep the prison facility at Guantanamo open when he becomes President. Has the administration consulted with the Trump transition team in any way about plans to transfer any detainees from Guantanamo to third countries?\nMR. EARNEST: I can't speak to any specific conversations. I can tell you that there are individuals who have been designated by the President-elect to serve as the lead of his transition team both as it relates to the National Security Council, but also other agencies that do work on the prison at Guantanamo Bay, including at the Department of Defense and the Department of State.\nI would certainly assume that some of those conversations have included a discussion about the prison at Guantanamo Bay and helping them understand the policy that we have pursued. And it's a policy that we will pursue until January 20th, as long as President Obama remains President of the United States.\nQ: So the administration feels then a need to consult with the Trump transition team about any plans that it may have to transfer detainees from Guantanamo?\nMR. EARNEST: I think, John, what I'm trying to say is I'm not going the get into the specific details of their conversations. I can tell you that senior officials at the Department of State, at the Department of Defense and at the National Security Council are committed to what the President has made a top priority, which is a smooth and effective transition to the next presidency. That's going to include a detail discussion of complicated issues that those agencies are dealing with.\nSo, to the extent that we want the incoming team to have a good understanding of what our policy has been with regard to the prison at Guantanamo Bay, understand the steps that we're taking to review the case files of individual detainees, to understand the steps that we take to negotiate with other countries to understand what sort of security requirements we insist on when those prisoners are -- those detainees are transferred -- that's a good thing and that will ensure a smooth and effective transition. But this is a policy that will remain in place until President Obama leaves office on January 20th. After that and what policy will be in place after that is something that the President-elect and his team will have to work out.\nQ: One final thing on this. There is only one President at a time. There is only one Commander-in-Chief at a time. Does what you're saying, Josh, does it mean that the Trump transition team has no essentially veto authority on any detainees that could be transferred to third countries?\nMR. EARNEST: Yes, of course not, they don't. The decision that's made to transfer individuals is based on a review of their case file by national security experts at a variety of national security agencies, including the intelligence community, the Department of Defense and others. Once they have reached a determination that a detainee is eligible for transfer, then the Department of State goes to work in trying to do some diplomacy with another country to get them to accept the transfer of this detainee under a set of security requirements that limit the ability of that detainee to pose any risk to the United States or our interests or our allies.\nSo that's difficult work, but that's work that we've been doing for almost eight years now and that's work that will continue at least through January 20th. After that, the President-elect's team will have to decide how they want to handle that situation.\nMark.\nQ: Josh, have the Obamas bought a home in Rancho Mirage?\nMR. EARNEST: I know there's been some reporting speculating that they were considering doing that. I don't have any updates on any real estate transactions. Obviously the First Family still owns a home on the South Side of Chicago, and we have publicly discussed their intent to remain in Washington for a couple of years after President Obama leaves the White House, and they'll be renting a home here in the Washington area. But for any transactions beyond that, I can't confirm those reports.\nQ: Or Hawaii?\nMR. EARNEST: Obviously the President has great affection for Hawaii, but I'm not aware of any real estate transactions that he's made there at this point.\nQ: How many receptions are the Obamas hosting in this final cycle, do you know?\nMR. EARNEST: For the holiday season? Many. I don't have the exact count, but we can look that up for you. The First Lady's office has been doing the work of organizing many of these activities, but we'll see if we can contact them on your behalf and get you an answer.\nJC.\nQ: Speaking of executive residences, the First Lady has often described the rigors of living here at the White House as kind of living above the store. Obviously there are advantages of the President living in this particular executive mansion. It seems that Mr. Trump may become sort of -- or his family certainly a part-time resident of the White House. What are the thoughts of this administration, especially when it comes to the national security areas, being close to the Situation Room, literally within minutes, that Mr. Trump may somehow be a bi-city resident -- or his family certainly will be?\nMR. EARNEST: Well, listen, obviously the President-elect and his family will have to determine what sort of living arrangement makes the most sense for them. And that's obviously not something I'm going to second-guess. We've made clear that when President Obama is traveling, he essentially takes the inner workings of the White House with him so that he can execute all of the duties that he has as President of the United States. And he's able to do that from aboard an aircraft and he's able to do that from overseas when he's traveling.\nSo I certainly wouldn't anticipate that the President-elect would encounter any difficult in trying to do that from New York City. But, look --\nQ: But if he's --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, look, as far as I can tell, he has for a number of years enjoyed the benefits of living above the store in Trump Tower, and so maybe he would appreciate the benefits of living above the store here in Washington, too. But ultimately, that will be for him and his family to decide, and I wouldn't second-guess or criticize that decision one way or the other.\nTara.\nQ: I have a question about Guantanamo. I understand that transfers will still take place and they're still being planned -- the transfers of detainees out of Guantanamo. But I'm wondering about the briefings that you're having for the incoming members, like Mike Pompeo, who is from Kansas. I know there was some history of him in Guantanamo, and I wondered if you had talked to him in the past about maybe the possibility of moving detainees to Kansas or how you might build on that.\nMR. EARNEST: I can't speak to what sort of conversations may have occurred with Congressman Pompeo. He obviously is somebody that has -- I believe he served on the House Intelligence Committee, so he is conversed in many of these issues. So I'm confident he's had some discussions with senior administration officials about our approach to a range of these national security issues, including our efforts to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. But I can't speak to the details of any of those discussions.\nQ: -- spoke with him, did you, about, like, anything related to Kansas or the transfers? You didn't know him from before?\nMR. EARNEST: Me, personally? No, I've never had the pleasure of meeting Congressman Pompeo.\nI'll give this gentleman in the back the last question.\nQ: I wanted to ask about the Nobel Prize award meeting this afternoon. I was wondering if you could comment on how well the President feels that he has lived up to his own award -- the Nobel Peace Prize that he was awarded seven years ago, over the last seven years.\nMR. EARNEST: Look, I think that's an excellent question, one I'm sure the President can answer better than I can. What --\nQ: -- come out --\nMR. EARNEST: Well, we'll see. (Laughter.) The one thing I guess I would encourage those who are interested in this question to do is to go back and look at the speech that the President delivered in December of 2009 -- maybe you've done this -- in which the President talked about what his approach to being the President of the United States would be and how that was consistent with the aspirations that were represented by the committee's decision to award him the Nobel Prize.\nAnd I feel confident in telling you that the President feels that he's lived up to the standard that he has set for himself in that speech. He acknowledged that his first responsibility and his first duty as President of the United States is to protect the American people. And in some cases, that has required him ordering the United States military to kill people who are trying to kill Americans. What the President has also tried to do is to use other elements of American power to advance our values and our interests around the world. And that's something that a U.S. President is uniquely positioned to do.\nAnd many of you who have had an opportunity to cover President Obama as he's traveled around the world, have seen that he's spent time in intensive discussions with other world leaders about military campaigns. He's taken advantage of the opportunity to thank our men and women in uniform for their service in protecting this country when they're deployed at bases overseas, in many cases far away from their families and loved ones. He's had an opportunity to thank them firsthand for their willingness to put their lives in harm's way to protect America.\nBut the President has also spent a lot of time meeting with opposition figures in other countries, meeting with activists in other countries who fighting for greater freedom and liberty. The President has met with entrepreneurs in other countries -- people who are seeking to build a stronger economy and a better life for them and their family in a way that contributes to their community and for their country.\nAll of that is consistent with the basic responsibilities of the President of the United States, consistent with the kinds of values that we cherish in this country, and in the President's mind, consistent with the aspirations that were exhibited by the committee when they decided to award him the Nobel Prize in the first place.\nSo many people made the observation in 2009 that President Obama hadn't earned the Nobel Prize. And I don't think anybody saw a particularly aggressive argument from the President at that time. But people will have an opportunity now, after almost eight years that the President has served in office, to evaluate whether or not, based on his record of protecting the American people and advancing our interests around the globe, whether or not he's lived up to the aspirations of the Nobel committee. And the President is quite proud of his record.\nThanks, everybody. We'll see you tomorrow. And maybe even later tonight.\nEND 1:17 P.M.

He also recognized that substance use disorders are a critical public health issue. Today at the White House, Administration officials and other leaders from across the country highlighted the progress that has been made over the past eight years in substance use disorder prevention, treatment, recovery, and research.\nIn particular, the President has made clear that addressing the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic is a priority for his Administration and has called for $1.1 billion in new funding for States to expand access to treatment. This week Congress is considering legislation to act on the President's request and provide $1 billion in new funding to combat the opioid epidemic.\nThe Administration's balanced public health and public safety approach to drug policy is built on the scientific research demonstrating that substance use disorder is a chronic disease of the brain that can be successfully prevented and treated, and from which people can recover. The Administration has directed Federal agencies to expand community-based efforts to prevent drug use before it begins, empower healthcare workers to intervene early at the first signs of a substance use disorder, expand access to treatment for those who need it, support the millions of Americans in recovery, and pursue targeted approaches to drug enforcement.\nA full report on how Administration actions taken over the past eight years have expanded resources and protections for people with substance use disorders is available HERE.\nHighlights include:\n•      The Affordable Care Act created the largest expansion of mental health and substance use disorder coverage in a generation. It is estimated that the ACA expanded mental health and substance use disorder benefits and parity protections to more than 60 million people.\n•      The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued its Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain – the Agency's first-ever recommendations for primary care clinicians on prescribing opioids. Subsequently, more than 60 medical schools, nearly 200 nursing schools and more than 50 pharmacy schools committed to prescriber training.\n•      The Surgeon General's first-ever Report on Alcohol, Drugs, and Health addressed alcohol, illicit drugs, and prescription drug misuse, with chapters dedicated to neurobiology, prevention, treatment, recovery, health systems integration and recommendations for the future. It provided an in-depth look at the science of substance use disorders and addiction, called for a cultural shift in the way Americans talk about the issue, and recommended additional actions to prevent and treat these conditions, and promote recovery.\n•      SAMHSA finalized a rule in July 2016 that allows practitioners who have had a waiver to prescribe buprenorphine for up to 100 patients for a year or more, to now obtain a waiver to treat up to 275 patients.

{"author": "Barack Obama", "source": "http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=122660", "text": "\"[I]t has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things—some celebrated, but more often men and women obscure in their labor—who have carried us up the long rugged path towards prosperity and freedom.\" – President Obama, Inaugural Address, January 21, 2009\nAmerica's entrepreneurial economy is the envy of the world. Young companies account for almost 30 percent of new jobs, and as we have fought back from the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes, startups have helped the U.S. private sector create 15.5 million jobs since early 2010—the longest streak of private-sector job creation on record.\nToday, in celebration of  National Entrepreneurship Month, the Administration is releasing a Top 10 list of President Obama's most significant specific actions to promote American entrepreneurship, as well as announcing new efforts to build on these successes. The President's unprecedented focus on the role of startups in the United States' innovation economy is exemplified by his launch of  Startup America in 2011, a White House initiative to celebrate, inspire, and accelerate high-growth entrepreneurship throughout the Nation.\nThanks to the grit, determination, and creativity of entrepreneurs all across the country, American startup activity is rebounding and growing more inclusive of historically underrepresented groups and regions. Studies indicate that:\n* Reversing a downward cycle that began during the Great Recession, U.S. startup activity ascended last year, representing the largest year-over-year increase in the last two decades, while measures of startup revenue and employment growth have rebounded across industries as well.\n* New companies created 889,000 jobs in the final quarter of 2015—the highest job creation number since 2008.\n* Rates of entrepreneurship have increased for Latinos, African Americans, and immigrants between 1996 and 2015.\n* Between 2007 and 2016, the number of women-owned firms is estimated to have grown at a rate five times the national average, including a more than doubling of the number of firms owned by African American women and Latinas.\n* American startups are not only rebounding, they are taking root in more communities all across the country—for example, the share of U.S. metro areas that attracted early stage venture capital has increased by around 50 percent since 2009.\n* The number of U.S. startup accelerator programs increased from fewer than 30 in 2009 to over 170 in 2015, providing mentorship and early funding to thousands of startups across 35 states plus D.C. and 54 metro areas.\n* Access to capital for high-growth entrepreneurs has improved significantly since 2009, with venture capital investment up an estimated 200 percent, far exceeding its pre-recession peak, and angel investment up 40 percent, approaching its pre-recession peak.\n* Compared with 137 countries, the United States continues to top the rankings in the Global Entrepreneurship Index, with the world's most favorable conditions for entrepreneurs to start and scale new companies.\nOver the past 8 years, many of the President's signature achievements have significantly increased opportunities for entrepreneurs to take smart risks and build the next generation of great American companies: the Affordable Care Act is making it easier for entrepreneurs to buy health insurance, unlocking them from traditional employer-based coverage; the Pay As You Earn program is making it easier for entrepreneurs to pay off student loan debt; the Open Data Initiative has unlocked over 200,000 government datasets as raw material for entrepreneurial innovation; ConnectED and ConnectALL are allowing aspiring entrepreneurs everywhere to access high-speed broadband, while a strong net neutrality policy ensures a free and open internet; and the President signed into law the largest annual increase in research and development funding in America's history.\nBreaking down barriers for all entrepreneurs is not the task of just one Administration. For example, studies suggest that the share of venture-funded startups with women founders has nearly doubled in 5 years—but it is still only 18 percent. Continuing to reverse America's 40-year decline in startup activity will require building on the President's record of addressing income inequality, promoting competitive markets, reducing unduly restrictive occupational licensing, and scaling up rapid training for 21st century technology skills.\nIn addition to releasing today's Top 10 list of President Obama's specific actions to promote entrepreneurship, the Administration is also announcing new private-sector actions to promote inclusive entrepreneurship.\nNew Actions by Organizations Answering the President's Call to Action\n•      Engineering deans from over 200 universities are committing to building a more-representative student talent pipeline. At the first-ever  White House Demo Day in 2015, 102 engineering deans pledged to develop concrete diversity plans for their programs to tap into diverse talent. Since then, the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) has worked with its members to share best practices and to promote the inclusivity in engineering schools of all students regardless of visible or invisible differences. ASEE is creating a platform to disseminate best practices among participating engineering schools that will help them implement the diversity initiative. Today, at 206, the number of engineering deans that have signed the pledge has more than doubled since 2015. ASEE will continue promoting and enhancing diversity and inclusion through all its participating members. Read letter  HERE.\n•      79 companies have now joined the Tech Inclusion Pledge. At the  Global Entrepreneurship Summit this past summer, President Obama announced a commitment by senior leadership from 33 companies of all sizes to fuel American innovation and economic growth by increasing the diversity of their technology workforce. Today, 46 additional companies, including Xerox, TaskRabbit, and Techstars, are joining this Tech Inclusion Pledge, committing to take concrete action to make the technology workforce at each of their companies representative of the American people as soon as possible. To facilitate additional pledge commitments and help companies meet those commitments, the National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT) and CODE2040 commit to maintain a website with free research-based implementation resources. Read letter  HERE.\n•      Early-stage investors are making a new commitment to promote inclusive entrepreneurship. Today, more than 30 investment firms, angel investor groups, and startup accelerators with over $800 million under management have committed to achieving greater transparency in their funding criteria and to actively mentoring entrepreneurs from underrepresented backgrounds, in an effort to increase the diversity of startup founders in their portfolios. For example, MassMutual Foundation and Valley Venture Mentors are partnering to create a scalable model for rural startup accelerators, while Pipeline Angels is bringing its training programs for underrepresented investors to 20 additional cities. Read letter  HERE.\nThe President's Top 10 Actions to Accelerate American Entrepreneurship\n1. Signed permanent tax incentives for startup investment. The President signed into law 18 tax breaks for small businesses in his first term, including tax credits for those who hire unemployed workers and veterans. In addition, in December 2015, Congress responded to the President's call to make two critical tax incentives permanent for the first time:\n•      Made the Research and Experimentation (R&E) tax credit available to startups. In addition to making the R&E tax credit permanent for the first time since its enactment in the early 1980s, Congress also expanded the credit to allow pre-revenue startups and small businesses to take advantage of the credit by counting it against up to $250,000 in payroll expenses for up to 5 years.\n•      Permanently eliminated capital gains tax on certain small business stock. First enacted on a temporary basis in the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 and now permanent, this measure eliminates capital gains realized on the sale of certain small business stock held for more than 5 years, providing a major incentive for private-sector investment in high-growth entrepreneurial firms that fuel economic growth.\n2. Accelerated the transition of research discoveries from lab to market. The Federal government invests over $140 billion each year on Federally-funded research and development (R&D) conducted at universities, Federal laboratories, and companies. The President issued a memorandum to agencies to accelerate the commercialization of Federal R&D, and made these Lab-to-Market efforts a core part of his management agenda.\n•      Scaled up I-Corps, a rigorous entrepreneurship training program for scientists and engineers. The Innovation Corps (I-Corps) program, first launched in 2011 by the National Science Foundation (NSF), provides entrepreneurship training for Federally funded scientists and engineers, pairing them with business mentors for an intensive curriculum focused on discovering a truly demand-driven path from their lab work to a marketable product. Over the past 5 years, more than 800 researcher teams have completed this I-Corps training, from 192 universities in 44 states, resulting in the creation of over 320 companies that have collectively raised more than $93 million in follow-on funding. The I-Corps model has been adopted in 11 additional Federal agency partnerships, including an expansion to 17 Institutes and Centers at the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and is implemented through a National Innovation Network across more than 70 universities. Additionally, the Department of Defense's MD5 National Security Technology Accelerator is helping provide students with the training to apply a similar lean startup methodology to real-world national-security problems, soon expanding to eight institutions of higher education this spring, and including new challenges in diplomacy, urban resilience, and energy.\n•      Facilitated personnel exchanges between Federal labs, academia, and industry. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published a final rule on \"Technology Innovation-Personnel Exchanges,\" allowing Federal agencies to more easily exchange personnel with universities, non-profits, and the private sector to advance R&D commercialization.\n•      Increased access to Federally-funded research facilities and intellectual property for entrepreneurs and innovators. Funded by NIST, the Federal Laboratory Consortium launched online tools for finding specific information and open data on more than 300 Federal laboratories with 2,500 user facilities and specialized equipment, as well as over 20,000 technologies available for licensing.\n•      Strengthened Federal R&D funding for startups and small businesses. For the first time in a decade, in 2011 the President signed a long-term reauthorization of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs, which annually provide over $2.5 billion in Federal R&D funding to technology startups and small businesses. The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) and 11 participating Federal agencies have expanded access to SBIR/STTR opportunities, including by building the SBIR.gov platform and initiating a road tour that has engaged historically underrepresented communities across the country.\n3. Cut red tape for entrepreneurs. The Administration's Startup in a Day initiative is cutting red tape to make it easier for more entrepreneurs to get started and grow their businesses. Over 100 cities, home to nearly 38 million Americans, have taken a public pledge to streamline their business startup processes, allowing entrepreneurs to navigate requirements in as little as 24 hours. To support these streamlining efforts, the SBA sponsored a prize competition won by 28 cities and communities; examples include the City of Los Angeles and the City of Long Beach, which both created online business portals that are open-source and can be shared with cities and communities across the country. Additionally, over 52,000 small business borrowers have connected to lenders under a new SBA online matchmaking tool called LINC, while SBA One is taking SBA's lending process entirely online, which will save hours of time and thousands of dollars per loan for entrepreneurs.\n4. Expanded regional entrepreneurship opportunities.High-growth entrepreneurship is taking root in more and more communities across the country, in part thanks to targeted investments by this Administration.\n•      Seeded startup accelerators in diverse communities. The SBA's Growth Accelerator Fund Competition serves entrepreneurs in a broad set of industries and sectors—from manufacturing and tech start-ups, to farming and biotech—with many focused on creating a diverse and inclusive small business community. From 2014 to now, SBA has funded over 200 startup accelerator programs in every corner of the country, serving well over 5,000 startups that have collectively employed over 20,000 people and raised over 1.5 billion in capital.\n•      Pioneered a regional innovation strategy. SBA's investments in 62 Regional Innovation Clusters have helped participating small businesses achieve an average employment growth rate of more than five times faster than regional benchmarks, and more than $650 million in Federal contract opportunities.\n•      Incentivized regional partners to work together on tech entrepreneurship. Through its Regional Innovation Strategies (RIS) program and the i6 Challenge, the Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration (EDA) has awarded $59 million in capacity-building grants that help entrepreneurs in diverse regions of the country move ideas to market, supporting the creation and expansion of research-commercialization centers and early-stage seed-capital funds. Earlier this month, EDA announced nearly $15 million in Federal funding plus $18 million in matching funds, reaching urban and rural areas in 19 states, including the first RIS investments that support historically black colleges and universities: a direct investment in Clark Atlanta University's agriculture and food technology commercialization program; and an investment in a program to increase access to early-stage capital in southeast Louisiana, in which Southern University is a partner. Among the 35 organizations receiving EDA support are a female-focused early-stage capital fund in Texas, a Native American-focused proof-of-concept program in Oklahoma, and urban innovation hubs focused on fashion technology in Brooklyn and on social innovation in New Orleans.\n5. Directly boosted entrepreneurs' access to capital. With only three states attracting the majority of venture capital, the Administration has focused on incentivizing investment in startup communities across the country.\n•      Catalyzed investments of $8.4 billion through the State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI). The  SSBCI was created through the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, which provided $1.5 billion to strengthen  state programs that support lending to small businesses and small manufacturers. Administered by the Treasury Department, SSBCI has catalyzed over $8.4 billion in more than 16,900 new loans and investments all across the country. To date, business owners report more than 190,000 jobs will be created or retained due to the new loans and investments stimulated by SSBCI funds. More than half of all SSBCI loans or investments went to young businesses less than 5 years old, and over 40 percent of the loans or investments were in low- or moderate-income communities. Over 30 states have allocated nearly half-a-billion SSBCI dollars to venture-capital programs—a dramatic increase in funding for the programs that are critical to expanding high-growth entrepreneurship into diverse regions around the country.\n•      Strengthened investment fund program for small businesses. The Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program, run by the SBA, is a multi-billion dollar investment program to bridge the gap between entrepreneurs' need for capital and traditional sources of financing. This Administration has created new pathways for impact investment funds that devote growth capital to companies in underserved communities and emerging sectors, as well as for early-stage innovation funds. The recently announced Open Network for Board Diversity (ONBOARD) is a public-private initiative working to expand the presence of underrepresented groups on high-growth company advisory boards, boards of directors, and senior leadership, particularly for those supported by SBICs.\n6. Prioritized inclusive entrepreneurship. As part of the first-ever White House Demo Day in August 2015, 40 leading venture-capital firms with more than $100 billion under management committed to advance opportunities for women and underrepresented minorities, and more than a dozen major technology companies committed to new actions to ensure diverse recruitment and hiring. These actions are complemented by today's announcements, as well as continued progress by Federal agencies, including:\n•      Reduced barriers faced by women entrepreneurs. SBA created the InnovateHER Business Challenge, where organizations throughout the country hold local competitions for new and innovative products and services to empower women and their families; in 2015, over 1,000 entrepreneurs participated in over 100 competitions, and these numbers doubled in 2016. Women-owned small businesses reached an important milestone in 2015, meeting the Federal contracting goal for such businesses for the first time in history; overall last year, the Federal government awarded an all-time high of 25.75 percent of government contracts to all small businesses, supporting 537,000 American jobs.\n•      Unlocked the potential of Federal inventions with entrepreneurs from all backgrounds. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Minority Business Development Agency, and the Federal Laboratory Consortium partnered together to launch the Inclusive Innovation Initiative (I-3), designed to increase minority business participation in Federal technology transfer.\n•      Trained veteran entrepreneurs for 21st century opportunities. The Department of Veterans Affairs Center for Innovation is helping to expand the 3D Veterans Bootcamp, a program that provides Veterans with technical training in 3D printing and design skills to accelerate designs to market. The training will annually prepare over 400 Veterans and transitioning service members for careers in advanced manufacturing and will provide guidance and resources for those wishing to launch their own business. Additionally, SBA launched  Boots to Business, an entrepreneurship education program that provides transitioning service members with introductory business training and technical assistance. Since 2013, over 20,000 transitioning service members, including many spouses, participated in the Boots to Business introductory class on over 165 military installations worldwide.\n•      Launched TechHire to train people for entrepreneurial opportunities and well-paying jobs. In 2015 the President launched TechHire, a multisector effort to empower more people from all backgrounds with the skills they need, through universities and community colleges but also innovative nontraditional approaches like \"coding bootcamps,\" that can rapidly train workers for technology jobs. Since then, 50 communities in partnership with over 1,000 employers have initiated local efforts that have placed over 2,000 people into tech jobs and entrepreneurial opportunities.\n•      Expanded entrepreneurial opportunities for the unemployed and underserved. The Department of Labor (DOL) has funded the expansion of voluntary state-run Self-Employment Assistance (SEA) programs, designed to encourage and enable unemployed workers to create their own jobs by starting their own businesses while receiving unemployment insurance benefits; helped make entrepreneurial training available to more than 200,000 low-income and out-of-school youth with barriers to employment; and helped make it easier for formerly incarcerated persons to participate in the SBA's microloan program.\n7. Created opportunities for promising entrepreneurs and innovators from abroad. While there is no substitute for Congress passing commonsense immigration reform, the Administration is taking the steps it can to fix as much of the broken U.S. immigration system as possible. Many of these commonsense steps are designed to attract and retain the most talented workers, graduates, and entrepreneurs from around the world.\n•      Released a rule tailored for international entrepreneurs. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) published a proposed International Entrepreneur Rule, which describes new ways in which DHS will make it possible for certain promising startup founders to grow their companies within the United States. Once this rule is finalized, it will provide much-needed clarity for entrepreneurs who have been validated by experienced American funders, and who demonstrate substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation—benefiting American workers and the U.S. economy.\n•      Acted to retain more of the scientists and engineers educated in the United States. American universities train some of the world's most talented students in science, technology engineering, and mathematics (STEM), but the broken U.S. immigration system compels many of them to take their skills back to their home countries. DHS published a final rule on STEM Optional Practical Training allowing international students with qualifying STEM degrees from U.S. universities to extend the time they participate in practical training, while at the same time strengthening oversight and adding new features to the program.\n•      Unlocked the talents of high-skilled Americans-in-waiting. The Administration is making it possible for high-skilled workers on temporary visas to accept promotions, change positions or employers, or start new companies while they and their families wait to receive their green cards, and ultimately become Americans, by the publication of a policy memo on job portability and a final rule improving employment-based visa programs. In addition, DHS published a new rule that has allowed the spouses of certain high-skilled immigrants to put their own education and talents to work and contribute to the American economy.\n8. Updated securities laws for high-growth companies. Thanks to the bipartisan Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act signed by the President in 2012, entrepreneurs have greater access to capital from the seed stage all the way to an initial public offering (IPO). These new capital-formation pathways include:\n•      The \"IPO on-ramp\" makes it easier for qualifying smaller firms to responsibly access public markets. Thanks in part to the JOBS Act, which phases in regulatory requirements for smaller companies making an initial public offering (IPO), in the year ending in March 2014 smaller IPOs were at their highest level since 2000; one study estimated that the JOBS Act was responsible for a 25 percent increase in IPO activity, including among biotech startups.\n•      Entrepreneurs can raise up to $50 million through regulated \"mini public offerings.\" Through the \"Regulation A+\" provision of the JOBS Act, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has qualified around 50 companies to make streamlined public offerings of over $840 million in aggregate—whereas the previous version of this rule was rarely used.\n§ Entrepreneurs can raise up to $1 million from regular investors through a new class of regulated crowdfunding platforms. A new, national, SEC-regulated marketplace for securities-based crowdfunding first opened for business 6 months ago; by one measure, these new crowdfunding platforms have allowed startups and small businesses to raise $12 million from over 15,000 regular investors.\n9. Made the U.S. patent system more efficient and responsive to innovators. The President signed the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act in September 2011, giving the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) new resources to significantly reduce patent application wait times. Total processing times for both patents and trademarks have been reduced by approximately 25 percent and 14 percent, respectively, since 2009. This reduction has come with both a 50-75 percent reduced cost for startups and small businesses, as well as the creation of a fast track program where applicants can get a final disposition in about 12 months. In addition, with a series of executive actions, the Administration has taken steps to increase transparency to the patent system and level the playing field for innovators, and leveraged the knowledge of the American people by crowdsourcing information about prior art. USPTO has also launched an International IP Toolkit to empower innovators with tools to facilitate exports and empower global expansions, a Patent Pro Bono Program across all 50 states to provide free legal assistance for inventors who file patent applications without the assistance of a patent attorney, and a fast-track review for patents related to cancer treatment as part of Vice President Biden's Cancer Moonshot.\n10. Unleashed entrepreneurship in the industries of the future. The President has long recognized that it is entrepreneurs in clean energy, medicine, advanced manufacturing, information technology, and other innovative fields who will build the new industries of the 21st century, and solve some of our toughest global challenges.\n•      Encouraged private-sector investment in clean-energy innovation. The Administration has created and promoted  new opportunities for clean-energy entrepreneurship, including support for student startups through  business plan competitions; vouchers for services available to small businesses at National Laboratories; embedded  entrepreneurial training within the National Laboratories; technical assistance and pilot testing at  regionally-focused incubators and establishment of a national incubator network to support entrepreneurs and small businesses; and awards through the SunShot Incubator for startups driving down the cost of solar energy. These opportunities have doubled the number of partnership agreements between small businesses and National Laboratories, and supported hundreds of startups that have attracted well over $3 billion in follow-on funding.\n•      Boosted innovation and entrepreneurship in the bioeconomy. In 2012, the Administration released the first-ever National Bioeconomy Blueprint, to outline a series of steps to grow and manage a sector that is generating annual revenues greater than $300 billion and that is contributing the equivalent of at least 5 percent of annual U.S. GDP growth. In 2015, recognizing that navigating the regulatory process for biotechnology products can be unduly challenging, especially for small companies, the Administration initiated an effort to  improve transparency and predictability in the regulatory system for biotechnology products.\n•      Spurred innovation and entrepreneurship in the commercial space industry. Working with NASA, American companies have developed new spacecraft that are cost-effectively delivering cargo to the International Space Station and are working towards ferrying astronauts there by the end of 2017. U.S. companies that got their start supporting government missions have increased their share of the global commercial launch market from zero in 2011 to 36 percent in 2015. Federal agencies are also leveraging innovative procurement methods and creating a supportive regulatory environment to allow space entrepreneurs to pursue ventures in areas such as remote sensing, satellite servicing, asteroid mining, and small satellites. More venture capital was invested in America's space industry in 2015 than in all the previous 15 years combined.\n•      Grew innovation ecosystems for nanotechnology and advanced materials. The National Nanotechnology Initiative has invested over $150 million per year in user facilities at Federal laboratories and universities that provide entrepreneurs low- or no-cost access to state-of-the-art instrumentation; cumulatively funded more than $700 million of nanotechnology-related research by small businesses; and catalyzed the creation of a  Nano and Emerging Technology Student Network and annual conference with a specific goal of promoting entrepreneurship. The Materials Genome Initiative, launched in 2011 to reduce the time and cost required to discover, manufacture, and deploy advanced materials, has opened up an array of  new data and infrastructure resources to entrepreneurs, including an expanding set of open-access databases to mine the properties of hundreds of thousands of materials.\n•      Enabled a new generation of aviation technology for commercial use. Powering a revolution in unmanned flight, this summer the Administration announced ground rules to govern commercial, scientific, public safety and other non-recreational uses of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS)—commonly known as \"drones.\" These rules are enabling the safe expansion of a new generation of aviation technologies and startups that will create jobs, enhance public safety, and advance scientific inquiry. Industry estimates suggest that, over the next 10 years, commercial unmanned aircraft systems could generate more than $82 billion for the U.S. economy and by 2025, the industry could be supporting as many as 100,000 new jobs.\n•      Supported the growth of advanced robotics. In 2011, President Obama announced the National Robotics Initiative (NRI) — a multi-agency collaboration to accelerate the development of next-generation robots that can solve problems in areas of national priority, including manufacturing, sustainable agriculture, space and undersea exploration, health, transportation, personal and homeland security, and disaster resiliency and sustainable infrastructure. The NRI has invested over $135 million in 230 projects in 33 states, fueling the development of new technologies and business opportunities, including robots that can inspect bridges, monitor water quality, and even aid in future space missions.\n•      Supported manufacturing entrepreneurship through a national network of R&D hubs. Manufacturing USA brings together industry, academia, and government to co-invest in the development of world-leading manufacturing technologies and capabilities. In the 4 years since its establishment, Manufacturing USA has grown to a network of nine institutes and over 1,300 members—of which more than one-third are small- and medium-sized enterprises. These public-private partnerships are catalyzing entrepreneurial activity by, for example,  working with regional Manufacturing Extension Partnership Centers to help small manufacturers across the nation adopt advanced manufacturing techniques; and blending manufacturing technology and entrepreneurship in project-based learning programs for high schoolers.\n•      Stimulated entrepreneurial solutions through increased use of incentive prizes. Since 2010, more than 100 Federal agencies have engaged 250,000 Americans through more than 700  incentive prizes on Challenge.gov to address tough problems ranging from fighting Ebola, to improving speech recognition, to blocking illegal robocalls. Competitions such as the NIH Breast Cancer Startup Challenge and many more have made over $220 million available to entrepreneurs and innovators and have led to the formation of over 300 startup companies with over $70 million in follow-on funding.\n•      Fostered grassroots innovation through the maker movement. Beginning with the White House Maker Faire in June 2014 and continuing with a National Week of Making in both 2015 and 2016, the Administration has supported a growing grassroots community of makers—Americans using new tools, technologies, and spaces to design, build, and manufacture. Federal agencies, companies, non-profits, cities, and schools collectively committed to creating over 2,500 maker-oriented spaces in the United States to expand access for both students and entrepreneurs. Earlier this month, more than 300 organizations from all 50 states, with industry support including Chevron, Cognizant, and Google, came together to launch an independent nonprofit called Nation of Makers, to provide an ongoing community of practice and leadership to the maker movement.\nPresident Obama has also elevated innovation and entrepreneurship as a foreign policy priority beyond America's borders. Following his historic 2009 Cairo speech, the President hosted the first Global Entrepreneurship Summit (GES) at the White House in 2010; since then, annual GES events worldwide have provided over 7,000 emerging entrepreneurs with networking and investment opportunities and catalyzed over $1 billion in private-sector commitments. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)  Partnering to Accelerate Entrepreneurship (PACE) initiative catalyzes private-sector investment and identifies innovative models that help global entrepreneurs bridge the \"pioneer gap.\" Working in partnership with more than 40 incubators, accelerators, and seed-stage impact investors worldwide, USAID's  U.S. Global Development Lab creates public-private partnerships dedicated to testing ways to foster entrepreneurship, which are expected to leverage $100 million in combined public and private investments. The Presidential Ambassadors for Global Entrepreneurship (PAGE) initiative is a collaboration among American entrepreneurs, the White House, the Department of Commerce, and other Federal agencies to harness the creativity of U.S. business leaders to help develop the next generation of entrepreneurs both at home and abroad. The Department of State's Global Innovation through Science and Technology (GIST) program has engaged with science and technology innovators and entrepreneurs in 135 emerging economies around the world, providing training and resources to help them build successful startups.\nFor additional information and progress updates on organizations answering the President's Call to Action to Advance Entrepreneurship, click HERE.", "timestamp": "2016-11-30", "title": "Fact Sheet: Celebrating President Obama's Top 10 Actions to Advance Entrepreneurship, and Announcing New Steps to Build on These Successes"}

Over 2.2 million men and women are incarcerated in American prisons, and over 11 million spend time in our jails, and the vast majority of them will return to their communities. Improving education and job opportunities for these individuals has a  recognized effect of reducing crime, and will make our communities safer.\nToday, the White House is hosting a convening on criminal justice reform to discuss the progress and advancements that have been made over the past eight years and the opportunities that remain to tackle persistent problems. This event is part of the Administration's continued efforts to bring together Americans who are working to improve the criminal justice system, from activists engaging in communities around the nation to law enforcement and elected officials working to lower the crime and incarceration rates, to formerly incarcerated people who are earning their second chance.\nIn conjunction with this event, the White House is announcing a round of new signatories to the Fair Chance Business Pledge and a series of Administration actions to enhance the fairness and effectiveness of the criminal justice system including:\n•      Final Office of Personnel Management \"Ban the Box\" Rule\n•      Federal Bureau of Prison Reforms\n•      White House Legal Aid Interagency Roundtable Report\nThese announcements build on the Administration's longstanding commitment to reforming the criminal justice system, improving reentry outcomes, and removing unnecessary obstacles facing formerly incarcerated individuals.\nFair Chance Business Pledge\nIn April, the White House launched the  Fair Chance Business Pledge encouraging companies to take action to ensure that all Americans have the opportunity to succeed, including individuals who have had contact with the criminal justice system. The pledge represents a call-to-action for all members of the private sector to improve their communities and expand their talent pools by eliminating unnecessary hiring barriers facing those with a criminal record.\nToday's signatories to the Fair Chance Business Pledge bring the total number of pledged employers to over 300. The companies and organizations that have signed the pledge collectively employ over 5 million Americans. The new commitments come from a diverse range of employers including: Ben & Jerry's, Clif Bar, CVS Health, Gap, Intel, Kroger, LinkedIn, Monsanto, Perdue Farms, Shinola, Target, Tyson Foods, Union Square Hospitality Group, and WeWork.\nAdditionally, Glassdoor created a Fair Chance Pledge badge that companies can add to their profile on the website to proudly demonstrate their commitment to maintaining hiring and training programs for individuals with criminal records.\nThe Department of Justice recently funded the Council of State Governments Justice Center (CSGJC) to assist Second Chance grantees and the field at-large through the National Reentry Resource Center. The award includes funding to provide employer-focused outreach and education to promote fair chance hiring practices. A coalition of Fair Chance Business Pledge Signatories has committed to working together with CSGJC and other external partners to share their successes in adopting fair chance hiring practices and encourage other businesses to follow suit.\nToday's announcement is further evidence of the private sector's support for a more fair justice system, and the Pledge is one of many initiatives where the White House has successfully partnered with the private sector to increase opportunity for all Americans.\nBy signing the Fair Chance Business Pledge, these companies are:\n•      Voicing strong support for economic opportunity for all, including the approximately 70 million Americans who have some form of a criminal record.\n•      Demonstrating an ongoing commitment to take action to reduce barriers to a fair shot at a second chance, including practices like \"banning the box\" by delaying criminal history questions until later in the hiring process; ensuring that information regarding an applicant's criminal record is considered in proper context; and engaging in hiring practices that do not unnecessarily place jobs out of reach for those with criminal records.\nTHE FAIR CHANCE BUSINESS PLEDGE\nWe applaud the growing number of public and private sector organizations nationwide who are taking action to ensure that all Americans have the opportunity to succeed, including individuals who have had contact with the criminal justice system. When around 70 million Americans – nearly one in three adults – have a criminal record, it is important to remove unnecessary barriers that may prevent these individuals from gaining access to employment, training, education and other basic tools required for success in life. We are committed to providing individuals with criminal records, including formerly incarcerated individuals, a fair chance to participate in the American economy.\nCompanies and organizations interested in joining the Fair Chance Business Pledge can do so by signing up HERE.\nToday's signatories include:\n•      Al Abbas Cookies\n•      Alley Taco\n•      American Eagle Sealcoating and Asphalt LLC\n•      Amity Foundation\n•      Andrews Funeral Home\n•      Avalon Breads\n•      Berry Much Yogurt\n•      Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce\n•      Brooks Lumber\n•      Butterball Farms, Inc.\n•      Byblos\n•      C.W.

The rule effectively \"bans the box\" for a significant number of positions in the Federal Government by delaying the point in the hiring process when agencies can inquire about an applicant's criminal history until a conditional offer is made. This change prevents candidates from being eliminated before they have a chance to demonstrate their qualifications.\nAs the nation's largest employer, the Federal Government should lead the way and serve as a model for all employers – both public and private. Banning the box for Federal hiring is an important step. It sends a clear signal to applicants, agencies, and employers across the country that the Federal Government is committed to making it easier for those who have paid their debts to society to successfully return to their communities, while staying true to the merit system principles that govern our civil service by promoting fair competition between applicants from all segments of society.\nFederal Bureau of Prison Reforms\nAs part of the Justice Department's deep commitment to a fair, effective criminal justice system, the Department announced today a series of reforms at the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) designed to reduce recidivism and increase the likelihood of inmates' safe and successful return to the community. Today the department released a memo from Deputy Attorney General Sally Q. Yates on reforms to residential reentry centers including covering the cost of obtaining state-issued IDs for inmates prior to their release from custody. Additionally, BOP is creating a semi-autonomous school district within the federal prison system and providing additional services for female inmates when the BOP facility in Danbury, Connecticut, resumes housing female inmates later this month. The Danbury facility will also house BOP's first-ever integrated treatment facility for female inmates.\nLast year, with the Department's support, BOP retained outside consultants to review the agency's operations and recommend changes designed to reduce the likelihood of inmates re-offending after their release from prison. As part of today's announcement, BOP is launching a new website, justice.gov/prison-reform, that compiles current and ongoing reforms at BOP, and includes the final reports from the outside consultants.\nWhite House Legal Aid Interagency Roundtable Report\nToday the  White House Legal Aid Interagency Roundtable (WH-LAIR) is issuing its first annual report to President Obama, \"Expanding Access to Justice, Strengthening Federal Programs.\" This report documents the significant steps that the 22 federal agency members of WH-LAIR have taken to integrate civil legal aid into programs designed to serve low-income and vulnerable people where doing so can both improve their effectiveness and increase access to justice.\nCo-chaired by Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Director of the Domestic Policy Council Cecilia Muсoz, and staffed by the DOJ Office for Access to Justice, WH-LAIR was established to help provide legal assistance to Americans in need to further our shared goals of breaking the cycle of domestic violence and elder abuse epidemic, ending homelessness among veterans, and helping to remove obstacles to employment for jobseekers. Recognizing the power of legal aid to both increase the availability of meaningful access to justice and improve outcomes in many federal programs, WH-LAIR agencies have been working together since 2012 to integrate legal aid into their programs, policies and initiatives.\nThe report addresses key federal priorities where civil legal aid improves program outcomes, and also describes agencies' efforts to partner with legal aid organizations to meet the needs of special populations, including veterans and servicemembers, tribes and tribal members, people with disabilities, people with criminal records, crime victims and disaster survivors.", "timestamp": "2016-11-30", "title": "Fact Sheet: White House Announces New Commitments to the Fair Chance Business Pledge and Actions to Improve the Criminal Justice System"}

And one of the best ways for us to be able to do that is to recognize the achievements of some Americans who have received an extraordinary honor: These are our American Nobel Prize winners for this year.\nThey have done amazing work that for laypersons are sometimes hard to explain. But they are delving into the deepest aspects of matter. They are exploring our ability to manipulate molecules. We also have an economist who is helping to make sure that our market system and our contracts operate in ways that are fair and just, and help us to organize our economic system in ways that are more efficient, but also produce good results for everybody.\nSo we are incredibly proud of them. And I think it's just a reminder that one of the things that makes America unique is our ability to attract talent from all around the world to study at some of our greatest universities, and for us to, in very practical, reasoned, fact-based, empirical ways, figure out how we can make the world a slightly better place. And the work that's being done here is going to result in progress, some of which we can't anticipate yet, but will lead to new products, new materials, new technologies. And, most importantly, the work that these gentlemen have done are going to inspire a whole a new generation of scholars and scientists and researchers so that we know that this will continue into future generations.\nAnd I'm very, very proud of them.

During the holiday season, incidents of impaired driving occur more frequently, and every December, we observe National Impaired Driving Prevention Month to highlight steps we can take to improve safety on our streets and raise awareness of these preventable dangers.\nRecently, the number of traffic crash fatalities caused by impaired driving has unfortunately increased—last year, preventable alcohol-related driving fatalities accounted for nearly one-third of all traffic fatalities. Consumption of alcohol by drivers, even those who are of legal drinking age, is highly dangerous, and drug use, including prescription drug use, can also harm judgment, perception, and the motor skills used when driving. Distracted driving—including eating, tending to passengers, and using a cell phone—can also be dangerous and is equally preventable.\nWe can all do our part to keep our roads safe and prevent these tragedies. As passengers, we can reduce our interactions with drivers and lessen distractions. As friends and family members, we can look out for loved ones who may be drinking and help them get home safely. And as citizens, we can always call 911 to report any dangerous driving we observe.\nMy Administration has worked to help Americans who struggle with substance use disorders and substance misuse, which can lead to incidents of drunk or drugged driving. We are also striving to give law enforcement officers the resources and support they need to combat impaired driving, and we must encourage the development of technologies like ignition interlock devices, which can prevent impaired individuals from getting behind the wheel. Through the Drive Sober or Get Pulled Over campaign, States and communities across our country are working to increase road patrols and sobriety checkpoints, in addition to raising awareness and improving education on the dangers of impaired driving. You can learn more about what we are doing to prevent impaired driving by visiting www.WhiteHouse.gov/ONDCP/DruggedDriving, www.NHTSA.gov/DriveSober, and www.Distraction.gov.\nWhether encouraging parents to set a good example for their teen drivers or educating every driver on the dangers of unsafe driving, we must recommit to doing everything we can to prevent driving-related injuries and fatalities. This month, let us continue empowering drivers to make responsible decisions and educating the American people on ways they can help keep our roads safe and our futures bright.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 2016 as National Impaired Driving Prevention Month. I urge all Americans to make responsible decisions and take appropriate measures to prevent impaired driving. In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-11-30", "title": "Proclamation 9547—National Impaired Driving Prevention Month, 2016"}

HIV/AIDS has taken tens of millions of lives—and far too many people with HIV have struggled to get the care, treatment, and compassion they deserve. But in the decades since those first cases, with ingenuity, leadership, research, and historic investments in evidence-based practices, we have begun to move toward an era of resilience and hope—and we are closer than ever to reaching an AIDS-free generation. On World AIDS Day, we join with the international community to remember those we have lost too soon, reflect on the tremendous progress we have made in battling this disease, and carry forward our fight against HIV/AIDS.\nBy shining a light on this issue and educating more communities about the importance of testing and treatment, we have saved and improved lives. Although we have come far in recent decades, our work is not yet done and the urgency to intervene in this epidemic is critical. In the United States, more than 1.2 million people are living with HIV. Gay and bisexual men, transgender people, youth, black and Latino Americans, people living in the Southern United States, and people who inject drugs are at a disproportionate risk. People living with HIV can face stigma and discrimination, creating barriers to prevention and treatment services.\nMy Administration has made significant efforts to fight HIV/AIDS, including by encouraging treatment as prevention, expanding access to pre-exposure prophylaxis, eliminating waiting lists for medication assistance programs, and working toward a vaccine. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, no one can be denied coverage for pre-existing conditions like HIV, and millions of people can now access quality, affordable health insurance plans that cover important services like HIV testing and screening. In 2010, I introduced the first comprehensive National HIV/AIDS Strategy in the United States, and last year, through an Executive Order, I updated it to serve as a guiding path to 2020. This update builds on the primary goals of the original Strategy, including reducing the number of HIV-infected individuals and HIV-related health disparities, improving health outcomes for anyone living with HIV and increasing their access to care, and strengthening our coordinated national response to this epidemic.\nCurrently, more than 36 million people, including 1.8 million children, are living with HIV/AIDS across the globe, and the majority of people living with HIV reside in low- to middle-income countries. We need to do more to reach those who are at risk for contracting HIV/AIDS, and the United States is helping shape the world's response to this crisis and working alongside the international community to end this epidemic by 2030. We have strengthened and expanded the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), with now more than $70 billion invested, to accelerate our progress and work to control this epidemic with comprehensive and data-focused efforts. With PEPFAR support for more than 11 million people on life-saving treatment and through contributions to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria—including a new pledge of more than $4 billion through 2019—there are now more than 18 million people getting HIV treatment and care. Because in sub-Saharan Africa young women and adolescent girls are over eight times more likely to get HIV/AIDS than young men, we launched a comprehensive prevention program to reduce HIV infections among this population in 10 sub-Saharan African countries. This summer, PEPFAR established an innovative investment fund to expand access to quality HIV/AIDS services for key populations affected by the epidemic and reduce the stigma and discrimination that persists. We have also helped prevent millions of new infections worldwide, including in more than 1.5 million babies of HIV-positive mothers who were born free of HIV. By translating groundbreaking research and scientific tools into action, for the first time we are seeing early but promising signs of controlling the spread of HIV.\nAccelerating the progress we have made will require sustained commitment and passion from every sector of society and across every level of government around the world. A future where no individual has to suffer from HIV/AIDS is within our reach, and today, we recommit to ensuring the next generation has the tools they need to continue fighting this disease. Let us strive to support all people living with HIV/AIDS and rededicate ourselves to ending this epidemic once and for all. Together, we can achieve what once seemed impossible and give more people the chance at a longer, brighter, AIDS-free future.\nNow, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim December 1, 2016, as World AIDS Day. I urge the Governors of the States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, officials of the other territories subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and the American people to join me in appropriate activities to remember those who have lost their lives to AIDS and to provide support and compassion to those living with HIV.\nIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.\nBARACK OBAMA", "timestamp": "2016-11-30", "title": "Proclamation 9548—World AIDS Day, 2016"}
